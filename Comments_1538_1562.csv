It’s difficult to just hit the grouns running, especially when he hardly plays. The more he plays consistently, the better hell get. As for Peluso, why sell him when he is ok with being on the bench and coming in during injuries, lesser games, or closing a match. He was better when he was deployed out wider especially along the biline. He’s not a bad squad player.

- Llorente has not been playing regularly for the last year. Give him time.
- Marrone has also missed playing time in the midfield in the last year. I count 2 games where he played in CM last season. This game alone (or for that matter, even a few games into the season) doesn’t mean he lacks the ability to be a great midfielder. I’ve always maintained that it’s not easy to play in multiple positions in a tactical side like Conte’s Juve. I truly believe he’s got the potential to be as good as Marchisio as CM, although of a different mould.
- Ogbonna has NEVER played as central CB / sweeper in 3 man backline. Again, Conte is very tactical and demands very specific game from his players. It will take time. My prediction is it’ll take the whole season until Ogbonna is truly comfortable in central CB (although I hope we shift towards 4-3-3 more this season).
- On the late substitution, the preseason is a time to test the players’ fitness (and some tactics, too). If they’re not tired, let them play until they are. That’s the basic and primary consideration, while tactics in my view is secondary when you play a team like Everton. Result IS NOT the main thing.
I might or might not offer more thoughts on Marrone, because I think his situation is delicate and interesting. In short, I think the best option for him is to be co-owned by another Serie A team.",JDAngkasa ,"Aug 1, 2013 ", 7:32 PM,

THis will be the first season under conte when the league is going to be strong but we still shd manage to win as we r ahead of everyone in the league.
We have not reach the lvl of barca, RM n bayern so we r in rebuilding stage the idea was not to be powerhouse of italy but to be a powerhouse in europe we r still a season or two away. With all the top 3 changing coaches the gap has become slightly smaller but it is still there.

Five takeaways from Juventus' loss on penalty kicks to Everton in San Francisco,Danny Penza,"Aug 1, 2013, 4:35pm PDT",,"well we have a lot of talented youth prospects to name a few of the top of head gabbiadini, boakye, sakor, bouy, leali, masi, pol garcia, fernando matteillo. But most of them needs some exp (isco broke out at malaga) while some r exceptionally talented like pogba but others need some time.
Plus right now our squad is growing or like JD pointed out rebuilding once our core (attackers included) is built, we can start integrating youth players, current two concerned r barza n pirlo. For barza we can directly replace with caceres or like someone pointed out licht (which he was already doing since last summer one or two games even in league he played there) n for pirlo we can put pogba there ofc not direct replacement the style will be changed but the team can still function well.

Five takeaways from Juventus' loss on penalty kicks to Everton in San Francisco,Danny Penza,"Aug 1, 2013, 4:35pm PDT",,"Just finished watching the game. A few thoughts (which haven’t been expressed by anyone that I recall):
- First goal was partly Ogbonna’s mistake as well. He was the sweeper, he had to stand behind Peluso when Mirallas got into the one on one situation. Peluso might have been left flat footed, but it is to be expected when you’re facing an opponent one on one in the box. Nearly impossible for a defender to do anything in that situation. Ogbonna, instead of giving assistance for Peluso, chose to man mark Anichebe, forcing Licht to run across to provide support. Clearly he was too late.
- Around the 40th minute mark, Llorente looked very tired. It’s clear that he was struggling physically, that’s why he was very static during the match, and consequently Tevez found it difficult to link up with him. On the 2nd half, he tried to move more, obviously after Conte talked to him. He couldn’t last long, obviously, and was the first one to be subbed.
- Tevez was given more free reign during the 2nd half. It was obvious that there was a lack of creativity going forward, so the burden had to go to Tevez to come deep, pick up the ball, and try to link up with Vidal, Llorente, and Asamoah. Before the goal, it was going nicely, but as usual we were caught on the break. This lack of creativity will always be an issue whenever Pirlo is not playing, which is really the falling of 3-5-2, IMO.
- I count 3 times Matri trying to play off the defender’s shoulder and beat the offside trap during the short stint he was on the pitch. It’s probably something that only he can do. Gio can probably do it as well, but he’s too lightweight to be of us in any other way if he is to play as the top striker. That’s why I would prefer Matri to stay instead of Quags: tactical options.
- Again, Marrone’s clear falling when playing as a deep playmaker: he’s too static when there’s a player marking him. Deep down he’s probably feeling the pressure as the last man in midfield, feeling that he has to hold his position. The one time he made an adventurous run forward to intercept a ball, he lost it immediately and there was nobody covering the 3 CBs during the break, so maybe it’s a feeling that is justified, but I am worried that Marrone is too conscious of this to be an effective deep lying playmaker. At least for now.
I’m trying to analyze from a tactical point of view, while still keeping in mind it’s a preseason friendly after all. It’s an assessment of which part we need to grow still before the season kicks off.",JDAngkasa ,"Aug 2, 2013 ", 8:46 AM,

Five takeaways from Juventus' loss on penalty kicks to Everton in San Francisco,Danny Penza,"Aug 1, 2013, 4:35pm PDT",,"I partially agree that Peluso could’ve done better, but for a defender tracking back on a counter and then facing an opponent one on one in the penalty box without any support, it’s nearly impossible for him to do anything. Mirallas only need half a second to register a shot, and it’s very easy to get that half a sec when you’re going one on one. Again, remember that Peluso was tracking back at full speed. If Peluso did stop Mirallas, I’d deem it Mirallas’ mistake rather than credit it to Peluso as well.",JDAngkasa ,"Aug 2, 2013 ", 6:25 PM,

Ogbonna- Well, that’as about the worst start you get get. it can only go up from hereon in. I dont see him starting unless there is an injury or suspension.
Llorente and Tevez- Zero Chemistry so far. both looked awkward with each other. Again, this will only improve.

Guinness International Champions Cup Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Everton,Danny Penza,"Jul 31, 2013, 6:30pm PDT",My two cents,"I’m going to try and not put too much emphasis on yesterday’s defeat, but nonetheless it was disappointing to see them lose like that. Here are my takeaways from the game
Positive:
- Isla seems to finally be showing some glimpses of his old self. He didn’t have the greatest game, but he absolutely made some great runs and got himself into good positions bursting past the Everton defense. His cross to Llorente should have been buried in the back of the net. It’s positive to see him pushing himself on the pitch, especially after taking a while to recover from his knee injury. Smart move by management to hold onto him.
- Vidal continues his tremendous form. Need I say more? He just keeps getting better. I’m sensing another player of the year award.
- Asamoah took a little while to get into a groove, but he played very well in the second half. He was able to take on his man and provide some creativity on the left hand side. His goal was a screamer off a mistake by the Everton defense.
- Ogbonna…maybe? He will be good in time. For now, we need Bonucci to play in that role. Currently, Ogbonna lacks the dribbling, creativity, skill, and long ball capabilities that Leo has. Additionally, one thing that makes Bonucci so strong is his ability to drive up through the CM and dictate play…something Ogbonna just can’t yet do.
- Tevez-Vucinic. As soon as they were both on the pitch together, you can see that they had some chemistry. Assuming they don’t sell Mirko, I’ll be interested to see how this plays out.

Negative:
- Peluso proves that he is no more than a squad defender that should be played against mid and low table teams only when Chiellini or Ogbonna can’t. To think that he started in a QF game against Bayern sure does make me scratch my head sometimes.
- Marrone looked awful. Missed a clear cut chance to score, AND got dispossessed far too easily which lead to the goal. I don’t want to be too quick to criticize because the kid has had like ZERO game time in CM last year, but he’ll need to do better than that.
- Llorente failed to make a difference. Didn’t “click” with Tevez upfront. His first touch yesterday wasn’t there. He looked beaten for pace & was unable to turn his man on a few different occasions. Should have done better with the cross from Isla.
- It’s been nice to see PDC get some game time, but it’s clear his skill level just will never be enough for first team football (not that this is anything new). He’s a squad player capable of making a difference in most games when the majority of the starting XI are playing. Last night he didn’t play well. Failed to really do anything of note.
- Too little too late & where’s the urgency? Why does Conte insist on waiting so long to make substitutions? This has been a recurring theme. It’s difficult for players to make a difference when they only get to play for 15-20 minutes. This was classic Juve…at the 70th minute THEN they decide to show a bit of fire and get an equalizer. That mindset has got to change.
- Disparity of quality of squad players in relation to the first team. Nothing new here, and probably one of the most discussed topics of this year’s transfer market. It’s what sets teams like Bayern apart from us.
- When the team is lacking the majority of the first team players, they suffer, badly. We’ve seen over the course of last season, that Juve maintains the ability to play top flight football when missing 1-3 players in a clip, but when more than half of the team is comprised of second strings players, things start to fall apart. Just watch the Coppa Italia games against Lazio, or the last game against Sampdoria, or any match in which we were missing most of our starters.
Best part of the game is that no one was injured. I’m assuming the next game will be against the LA Galaxy, which should be cool to watch.",MatteoX ,"Aug 1, 2013 ", 9:37 AM,

Guinness International Champions Cup Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Everton,Danny Penza,"Jul 31, 2013, 6:30pm PDT",Few thoughts,"I was really impress with Ogbonna, he manned the backline playing alongside Lich who was playing out of position and Peluso who is the 3rd string CB and still had to battle everton’s CF who’s built like a frikkin bull. He showed composure, strength and pace and read the game very well playing in his first competitive game for us.
Tevez in the 1st half looked like he was trying to get a feel of where his teammates like to position themselves and he had a few misplace passes and a few errors. The 2nd half is when we saw the player we brought in the be the #10 and especially after everton’s goal he just went full beast mode and started making the everton defenders look inferior.
Llorente almost looked over awed with either the occasion or lining up as a Juve player. He couldn’t control his nerves which resulted in him giving the ball away on many occasions in the 1st half. The 2nd half he did better, his touch and control was better and his pass to Isla should have resulted in an assist. Even though he missed that point blank sitter he should buried…I like the potential in him playing in our shirt.
Vucinic….simply cannot be considered for sale some may not like him but i’ve always defended him and he still has a lot to give us. His chemistry with Tevez was simply fantastic that was the kind of chemistry we hoped Giovinco would have provided with him at the start of last season. I think Vuc will boss his way back into the starting line-up when it’s all said and done this season. I also think Conte should consider playing him upfront alongside Tevez and Llorente especially if we’re in a game that we need a goal to either get back in it or win.
Asamoah will definitely be the starting LWB I like the way he boss the left side of the field with his energy and movement. He’s finding that form he had at the start of last season.

Torino 0:1 Juventus - Bianconeri Scrape Through With A Controversial Goal,ivoandov,"Sep 30, 2013, 1:47am PDT",Just watched the game,"It doesn’t have that bite when you know all the major incidents and the final scoreline, does it? In any case:
- First thing’s first: Immobile. It was a nasty incident, it should have been a red card. No arguments there. However, I don’t think he intended to inflict any injury to Tevez, nor does he did it out of frustration, or revenge to Juve, etc, etc. It’s just a clumsy tackle from a young striker who was burning with the derby passion, that’s all. Now, with that said, his reaction post game is disgusting, and immature. He definitely knows he should have been red carded. He definitely knows he would be the headline if Torino had managed to get anything out of the game. He went all out defense with his statement, and it was a poor choice of action. Even Cambiasso, who I still believe 100% intended to injure Giovinco last season, came out and say he was sorry. Immobile has just decided to antagonize the whole Juve fans with his post match statement, maybe without him realizing it.
- Marchisio. Those who say he should have been red carded are clearly blind or biased. He made that tackle intending to win the ball, with no malicious intent, and the Torino player clearly tried to get him carded by falling before he even made contact. With that said, was that a brilliant decision by Claudio, though? Definitely not. He COULD have been red carded. In fact, I do believe he WOULD have been red carded if Immobile had been red carded. Remember, there’s about 20.000 people screaming for a red card at that very moment. The pressure on the ref was immense. That was, again, the referee’s way of trying to maintain the “balance” of decisions, just like the game against Chievo. On the punch on the back, in an ideal world, it would have been punished by the disciplinary committee by way of video evidence. But I won’t bet a dime on that ever happening.
- Tevez. He will play vs Galatasaray. This is again, just another mind game by Juve management to attract attention away from the offside goal: by directing attention towards the major incidents which could have changed the game. Well, the number one incident is Immobile’s stupid tackle, of course. I believe Tevez’ injury is just a simple bruise and cut. He’s fine.
- Pogba. In the 2nd half he was IMMENSE. I am very impressed with his defensive contribution. The way he plays, it kinda makes you wonder. He clearly is one of the best within the team in terms of physical strength and body balance when holding onto the ball. I think you can only compare Vucinic and Tevez in terms of guarding the ball against oppositions. It really makes you wonder, why can’t someone like Llorente do what Pogba does when playing with opposition on his back? If Llorente could do that…
- Buffon. Just kidding. Buffon didn’t play last night. Or did he? Wait… He did?",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 30, 2013 ", 10:18 AM,

I thought Giovinco could’ve avoided some remarks when he was away from Juve but after seeing what Immobile has had to say I’d be fine with Juve selling his rights first day of the transfer window.
-Toro players were searching for the second yellow and they looked like dumbasses doing it. I think any second yellow would’ve been soft. Add to that Meggithe orini punch and Cerci’s diving in the box and getting no card twice.

That’s principally the result of trying to play with his back to the goal against defenders generally a foot taller and 50 pounds heavier in a league that accepts contact as part of the game. And I like him ! I’d just like to see him sprung from the purgatory of playing forward.
I’m in the Asamoah is underrated camp. Plays Conte/Juventus style. In control and always helping on defense. He has no right foot and certainly no Kolorov as a crosser. He just is what he is, and doesn’t try to be what he’s not. Conte trusts him and so do I. When PDC or Peluso starts in his place, we concede goals that initiate from his side.

What I can’t work out was what was going through his head when he made that lunge. But let me try…
It can’t of been an easy day for Ciro when you think about his situation;
He is co-owned by both teams and as we all know, a Juve youth product so the where does his allegiance lie? No doubt he wants to impress Conte and earn his place in the Juve first team but he is also owned by their fiercest rival and will also want to impress his current playing teams fan’s by showing passion and determination for the shirt currently on his back.
Jealousy/Frustration? Tevez has “his” spot. Ciro has been talked about as if he could be the next big Italian striker for a good number of years now but he hasn’t ever really looked like living up to the billing. Other than his season with Prescara he hasn’t really impressed. Okay so maybe I sound like I’m writing off a season, don’t get me wrong, I’m not, I’m just puting it into perspective. It was Serie B and Zeman as a coach who is well known for being not only a giant douce but an insanely attacking based coach who had a young, talented midfield to provide plenty of service. Definitely not going to hurt a player like CIro. Saying that though, from that “impressive” Serie B team not many have successfully taken the next step into a big top flight club. Furthermore, when Immobile has had the opportunity/need to step up and show what he is made of he goes missing from the game.
For me, that tackle was the final nail in the coffin that is Ciro Immobile’s career in the black and white side of Turin. Toro, you can have him!",Chris Savage ,"Sep 30, 2013 ", 5:28 AM,

Interesting to note when Immobile played for Siena, Conte almost never used him and kept him on the panchina until he was shipped to Grosseto during the January finestra, then the following season he became Serie B Capocannoniere. Zeman or not, 28 goals for Pescara is a ton (in contrast, Sau had 21 that season for Juve Stabia) and Ciro’s 10 goals in 14 matches for Gli Azzurrini is also impressive, and at the close of the mercato last summer I remember saying I wanted him and not Bendtner on the roster – but the few times I saw him play last season for Genoa he looked absolutely awful, like he didn’t even belong in Serie A.
Even before yesterday’s actions Immobile seems like an afterthought, Juve has a stable of young strikers waiting for their shot and I don’t think Ciro is really even part of the discussion anymore.

Defense: Both Barzagli & Chiellini had monster games IMO. It should be noted that Barza made one mistake which was a very weak pass that could’ve turned into something worse if Asamoah wasn’t able to recover it. The Great Wall & King Kong seem to finally have found their rhythm (although I don’t think Barza ever lost his). Bonucci was a bit absent and for whatever reason wasn’t able to utilize his ball playing skills this afternoon.
Pogba Pulled a Marchisio in the first half…..j/k. Although he was VERY subdued. Looked look Immobile was man marking him, so I’m not sure if his non involvement was some tactic that Conte told him to use….perhaps in order to draw players too him? Either way, in the second half he was allowed to play the ball and looked fantastic. Great reflexes to net that goal.
Giovinco I’m of split opinion here. On one hand he did create some opportunities, but most of them were him trying to draw fouls. He’s frustrating in the sense that he’s so static in his play, and he constantly goes to ground. Although, he does win free kicks and corners like it’s his job. Tre Stelline pretty much hit the nail on the head
Clearly the 5th striker now, and have much more confidence in Quagliarella.
Vidal + Marchisio Both had strong games, especially Claudio. Vidal could’ve been a bit more active, but did his job nonetheless.
Asamoah I’m sorry to say this, but he just doesn’t do it for me anymore. I don’t think he’ll ever look as good as he did in the first few months of last season. While statistics may say otherwise, he really just doesn’t bring anything going forward. He’s failed to develop his game. A two trick pony if you will; try and dribble around the CB by running around him to the left, or cutting inside and placing a simple pass to one of our strikers. Too easy to defend because that’s all he does. Oh, and he can’t cross. Once in a blue moon we’ll see a moment of brilliance which tends to overshadow his less than spectacular performances. All that said, I don’t think he should lose his spot to anyone else on our squad. He’s leaps and bounds ahead of Peluso/PDC, especially from a defensive stand point, and he tends not to make mistakes, which is quite important.
While I’d like to see another midfielder arrive in January (a la Nainggolan) – why not splash the cash on a world beater LWB, and just slot back in Asamoah for the midfield. Sounds like killing two birds with one stone…
4-4-2? Maybe I’m crazy, or was just really tired, but it really looked like we switched to a 4-4-2/4-1-3-2 after Padoin came on. There was definitely a 4 man back line, but definitely not 3 in attack. Midfield was kind of weird with Marchisio-Vidal-Pogba-Padoin playing in a bit of a rotating triangle. Can someone clear this up for me?

I try to be very realistic with my transfer market expectations – the fact that Real Madrid was ready to loan out Coentrão to Manchester United, he is there for the taking and from my perspective Juve can upgrade LWB and shift Asa back to where he’s most comfortable (and effective). I’ve been touting this move since May, but if Cellino is to be believed (and that very well may require a suspension of disbelief) Nainggolan to Juve is a foregone conclusion now that Cagliari has 7 pts and comfortably mid-table.

Juventus 1 - Torino 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 29, 2013, 6:15am PDT","great read, as always, Matteo...","I am not in complete disagreement with you regarding Asamoah, but Lichsteiner had zero joy in the game yesterday, and if either one looked more lively in the final third, for me it was Asamoah…which means little when as with his swiss counterpart on the opposite flank, he ran into a wall of opponents whenever attempting to drive into the box, or make space down the wing. On this occasion I did not see Lichsteiner as more useful. Clearly it was a tactic to crowd the box, muscle out our wingbacks and stop runs into the box by Vidal (especially) and Marchisio to a lesser degree.
Vidal and Marchisio were very poor. Marked by at least one player whenever they went forward, and was often running into 2-3 players! As I have thought before, Pogba seems to be a very serious contender for the Marchisio role in our team. He is wasted sitting in front of the defence. He has better pace than Claudio, is infinitely harder to knock off the ball and will win a huge % more aerial battles. His passing in the final third is also usually of a high standard, both short and long and his shooting technique is superb, especially from range. Marchisio is a favourite of many here, and for damn good reason. He is a loyal, technically gifted, hard working player…However, our system works best with a regista. How wonderful would it be for our winter mercato to bring in Alonso and a top drawer LWB. I would love to see Pogba Alonso Vidal as our central trio.
When I saw Immobile’s challenge I immediately thought, as he did he perhaps, ‘that is the end of any hope for a career at Juve’. Tevez has that grit which I was banging on about regularly until Conte appeared on the scene, and Vidal and Lichsteiner. We had been suffering from a lack of grinta since Nedved hung up his boots, and then a lack of world class talent in the final third since DP began to die, slowly but surely. Tevez brings back both. Lets hope the injury isn’t too serious.
I thought it was a silly decision to play Giovinco, and am not in agreement of his policy applied to both Copenhagen and now Torino. If we are playing against a team with big defenders prepared to pile many bodies into the box, and we play a game which incorporates HUGELY our use of wingers, I do not see the obvious reason to play midgets. Tevez should always play, he is by far our best forward, but to bring Giovinco into this one…I didn’t like that, and neither did Giovinco. Better to give him 30 minutes against Gala than an outing against a Torino side determined to at all costs stop us playing in the final third. I would play Llorente against such teams. He is a big lad, very capable in the air and is highly experienced at finding space in the box. I felt bad for Seba at times…Have not yet written him off, but clearly he needs to be used wisely. Any one of Quags, Llorente or Vucinic would have been a better starting choice for Tevez.
It is tricky to find a LWB of real class we can afford and attract…We may well have to take a punt on some up and coming livewire…but who????",thegutterpoet ,"Sep 30, 2013 ", 1:01 AM,

Back to the off screen situation…
There is only one midfielder I find equal or even better than Vidal in his role and that is Yaya Toure…who is becoming even more dominant now that City have Fernandinho to share/shoulder the brunt of defensive duties. We are incredibly lucky to have Arturo, and we are even luckier to have grabbed Pogba for a pittance, whose signs of world class potential are steady, consistent and fast becoming a reality.
Our team is in a state of flux. Much was said of the ill-fated return of Pepe, and although I will welcome him back with open arms, I am unsure if Conte is eager to deploy a 4-3-3. He really could do that without Pepe…but seems more hellbent on simply replacing like for like, or bringing on Padoin! I do not think the formation is anywhere near as important as the system, to Conte.
Looking at the squad, our truly classy players are Buffon, Chiellini, Barzagli, Bonucci, Lichsteiner, Vidal, Pogba, Marchisio, Pirlo and Tevez. Conte likes width, which makes sense if we can own the flanks, but we face new problems and now need new solutions. It is not enough to simply be stronger, dominate possession against teams which deploy an ultra compact heavy defensive formation. Its instructive that we struggle against the weaker opponents, who halt our progress tactically. Does this mean that Conte is lacking tactically? Or that we need to buy other players for our system The only teams who will allow us to play to our strengths are the ones who believe they are equal or superior and that their own strengths will win through…Will be interesting to see what Gala deploy…and also Real Madrid.
I assume Conte is going through the same thought process…Now we are feared, how do we react to team which set out to pack their own box with bodies, mark our runners from midfield, force us to play from the flanks where…we are strong defensively but not great going forward??",thegutterpoet ,"Sep 30, 2013 ", 1:37 AM,

Juventus 1 - Torino 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 29, 2013, 6:15am PDT",,"So I had to comment on Roma’s terrific performance and I must say I’m quite impressed with how quickly they move the ball.
Much has been made about their lack of European football this season and the fact that it gives them a week to prepare for matches, and no doubt that helps when you see how ferociously they press the ball.
BUT, I feel like teams don’t park the bus (yet) against them like they do against Juve (and to a lesser extent Napoli & Fiorentina). Bologna left plenty of space behind the defence yesterday which Roma exploited expertly but would Bologna take that same approach against us? I doubt it.

Juventus 1 - Torino 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 29, 2013, 6:15am PDT",Strictly from a 3 minute highlight,"Roma scored 2 goals from embarassing defending by Bologna, and 3 goals from counter attack, on which again, Bologna defended very poorly. I agree with you that Roma has still not yet proven their worth against teams who park the bus. But to add to that, I think this is also partly the effect of Serie A teams trying to grasp Rudi Garcia’s tactic. Petkovic’s Lazio also enjoyed a very good start last season, but they finished somewhat weakly (although that might have been caused by their extended run in Europe as well) and continued to disappoint this season.
The test for Roma will start in the next 2 games.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 30, 2013 ", 1:21 AM,
Juventus 1 - Torino 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 29, 2013, 6:15am PDT",So the debate begins...,"Paolo Rossi, a Juve legend and world cup winner commented on Tevez’ offside saying that he was pushed into offside position and didn’t break the line himself, in fact he’s trying to safe himself from the trap.
Of course, his comment may have a portion of bias as he’s one of us, but I think he’s credible enough in the subject in discussion as he himself was a striker, can’t say I agree with him but on the same time I can’t say he’s wrong, simply because this is the first time I see someone ‘pushed’ physically into a trap and not with some sort of tactical deliberation from the backline.

But a shift would be quite easy with the options we have right now too. If memory serves me correctly, it was exactly this fixture, last season where we last played a 4-3-3 with Seba on the right flank, Giach on the left and Mirko in the center. It was one of Seba’s better games of the season and he was really effective from the right flank (had an assist and goal from memory).

Beppe Marotta says Juventus will hold talks with Andrea Pirlo in February or March,Danny Penza,"Sep 26, 2013, 4:00am PDT","1 year extension, but that's it.","When Pirlo decides to hang up his boots, he will certainly go down as one of the best midfielders to play the game. His contribution to Juventus has been a very important one. Pirlo joined us at a time period when we were completely reconstructing our team. Without him, it’s very possible that we wouldn’t have won two back to back Scudetti.
That being noted, it’s hard to argue that he has experienced a decline in form over the last season. Maybe it’s the fact that he’s 34 (and isn’t getting younger) or that opposition teams have effectively put more pressure on him. In any case, as a fan who’s been very appreciative of his services, I think it’s time to seriously start considering “life after Pirlo”.
My main concern is that this team has developed a bit of a crutch in the sense that we rely on Pirlo to be our creator. We’ve taken strides in the right direction, with the likes of Bonucci, Vidal, & Pogba stepping up their play making ability. Factor in Tevez & Vucinic (when he shows up), and we’re doing OK.
The sooner we are able to effectively phase him out, the better off it will be for our team in the long term. This way we can focus on the future of our team instead of worrying whether or not Pirlo will be able to make a difference in a certain game. Our other players will ultimately improve as well, because they will be forced to step up their game. The idea should be to slowly wane off his play making ability. If Pogba decides to continue his future with Juventus, I believe he will be Pirlo’s heir in the center of MF (as what type of midfielder, well that still remains a question).
Pirlo has said himself that he’s not interested in playing a bit part. For that reason, and all other things considered (age, current form, etc), I believe the best course of action for the club would be to negotiate a simple one year contract extension. However, there needs to be a clear understanding between player and club that while he won’t be playing a back-up role, that it is expected to be a “transition” year, and it will be at Conte’s discretion to play him. Even @ 35 for the start of next season, I’m sure he still can bring a lot to the table.
Just to wrap this up, I’m extremely appreciative of what he’s brought to our team. He’s a model professional and has helped us win on countless occasions. At this point though, it’s in the best interest of the team to look towards the future, rather than relying on a 35 y/o to be our creative spark. No disrespect, Andrea.",MatteoX ,"Sep 26, 2013 ", 7:23 AM,

Going a goal down in recent games have lead me to believe, scratch that, I have noticed teams realizing that they can’t fight fire for fire with us so instead they sit really deep, compacted in the centre because our wing play is non-existent, and counter attack with precision. If any one noticed in our first three game (Coppa Italia included) we pressed hard for the first 30 min but after our intensity dropped and we relaxed allowing lapses in concentration and openings in our defence. The solution to this is to keep the intensity up for the entire game but that in itself will leave players drained hence why I believe Conte high rotation policy this season. Conte wants players to maintain that hunger, drive, grita throughout the 90 mins.

Pirlo’s contract situation is very delicate, and in my belief/understanding it not only regards Pirlo and management but the squad both negatively and positively. His contract extension will not sit well with Pogba. Pirlo have stated he does not desire a bit part player roll, so who would have to make way, more than likely Pogba. Another negative effect to renewing his contract is Marchiso effectiveness on the field of play and his role. In the first Scudetto winning season Marchiso had over 10 goals/5 assists from open play but because of Pirlo natural defensive weakness someone has to be sacrificed to ensure Pirlo is not targeted by opponents hence last season we saw Marchiso doing a greater share of defensive duties and his forward runs/offensive power being reduced because of the tiring by age, defensively weak, creative mastermind that is Pirlo. Then there is the formation because of his worsening speed/pace, defensive ability and physical tiredness he has become a liability for our defence, ideally, a physically strong, creative mastermind, very athletic, composed in possession is what required. Over the last couple of months a lot of people have launched attack after attack at him but he is one of the most adaptable players there is so he has changed his game to protect Pirlo and the defence so his recent injury had us open to attacks. Then there are the positives, you have a world class, creative mastermind, who can see the game at another level, influence players positively with his presence, etc.

Cheillini and Buffon recent form has been very disturbing but I feel all these things are rust and will be gone in a couple of weeks.

Someone recently posted on the average age of the squad is the highest in serie A and its so frightening that we may end up in a Inter/AC Milan kind of situation but in all truth we do have a lot of young players on our books who are currently demonstrating they have the quality return. By the end of next summer transfer window Peluso, De Ceglie, Motta, Padion, Quags, Vuc, Pepe, Pirlo should be sold, freed, released, etc. Don’t mean to be talking transfers but Muriel and Gabbadini to replace Vuc and Quags, a winger cant chose none Coentrao as a LB/LWB, Bonaventura/Nainggolan or both since I believe it’s time to move on from Pirlo, we had to move on from Del Pero so who is Pirlo, better to make the move now than when we lose someone else because we choose him. It reminds me a bit of the scenario when Pogba chose to leave ￼ManU because rather than giving him the chance they brought back Scholes. We must not make that mistake if Pirlo stays/is retained it’s as back up for Pogba not as first choice else we risk losing Pobga for a player who has about 1 year in him just ManU.

The formation has been attacked by some here as cause of the deficiencies we have suffered but truth be told all our success has come as a result of it but like I said in point one, that today teams realize they don’t have the power or skill to go head to head with us so they said to sit back and absorb pressure and hit us on the precession counter attack. Even though I don’t believe 3-5-2 is at fault I do believe change and flexibility is required when your opponents think they can out think you. I have been tinkering and probing formations and our analysing our current squad and each individual abilities, and I have see the 4-2-3-1 or 3-4-1-2 working well for us and in neither we have to lose Bonucci, though I did not accommodate Pirlo because for me he cant work in any of these formations and he doesn’t have much of a future if any. The 4-2-3-1 Buffon; Lich, Barzagli, Cheilini, Asamoah; Bonucci, Pobga; Vidal, Tevez, Marchiso; Llorente. The 3-4-1-2 Buffon; BBC; Lich, Vidal, Marchiso, Asamoah; Pobga; Tevez, Llorente.

Llorente has a lot to give but as we have seen past 2 games he needs time to adjust and regain form there is nothing else to it all the speculations. His last season in Bilbao has been mental and physically difficult for him since he was a prisoner there instead of a player which now has caused difficulty in adjusting , now he also has to regain form along with modifying to Serie A.

All in haven’t addressed everything but when I get some more time will add some more thoughts.￼￼",juvetrini ,"Sep 27, 2013 ", 11:49 AM,

I swear it’s also the first time in 3 years I remember him getting a decent shot in AND on goal, so good for him. His passing accuracy was better than usual but the others defenders were still higher (this says pretty much nothing so whatever) but sometimes the passes he doesn’t make leave us compromised on the back which could lead to errors or carelessly giving the ball away going forward or on a breakaway which frustrates me to no end. Similar situation with Pirlo, other players do this of course but I was focused on Chiellini for most of the match.
Ugly and lucky result aside, let’s focus on the next game like I’m sure Conte and the team are already doing.
Classy move from Chievo’s coach and president, they avoided controversy with the disallowed goal and the president even went to console the refs and give them so words of confidence afterwards. UNPRECEDENTED in Serie A, happy to see it.",cugino1897 ,"Sep 25, 2013 ", 5:28 PM,

Overall the team didn’t look terrible, but we really failed to create as many chances as we are used to seeing. That’s what happens when Tevez, Vucinic, ’Steiner, Bonucci, & Vidal are on the bench from the first minute.
Pogba continues to impress. Chi3ll0 put in a solid game, but Pogba takes the MotM for me – without his contributions we would have lost, simple as that.
Elaborating on Danny’s comment…
Hey, maybe it’s not such a bad thing that Juve kept this guy around this summer and giving him a bit of playing time.
I was thinking immediately after the game that for a guy who was almost surely going to leave (according to the lovely Italian press), he’s sure getting a lot of minutes, and making solid contributions.
The thing that irked me most about this game was that we continue to lack that drive and pressing from the opening whistle. It takes an opposition goal before we really start trying.

Defending was absolutely shambles yesterday. Chievo barely attacked yet there was a 3 on 3 situation at least four times yesterday. Mind you, this was a short pitch, so it’s not like over the head balls opened us up. We missed Vidal’s bustle in midfield.
I am not convinced AT ALL with Peluso playing a LWB. Yesterday he was playing up the pitch often but his sense of positioning is poor so he was not tracking back in time, leading to those situations where Chievo attackers went 3 on 3. Some of his crosses are decent but only 2 out of 10 have any direction. I don’t think its worth playing him as a LWB when the offensive output is so less and defensively we are more suspect. I am ok with him being a LCB, but not LWB.

Allow me to make a few points on regards to Juventus and the “issues” surrounding the performances.
One of the main issues that many will talk about is the mistakes being made at the back line and how many balls are being poorly distributed. Taking into consideration of how the other clubs and Serie A are starting to go back to their roots many clubs this season have Rienforced each owns squad… With that said Juventus didnt really upgraded much so is obvious the performance will suffer mainly because I want to say we have a handicap as to others awesome signings of high caliber players.
Second when Juventus goes into a match realize that is only Juventus playing the other team is just defending and counter attacking while sometimes picking up a couple of passes from the backline. Just put it into equation we have a very lacking strike line that is trying to deliver and it will get there but for now is a work in progress.
Lastly you guys have to give the players a break I mean which team was the last one to win two scudettos in a row? You cant will all the time and certainly no one will just bend their arm and let us take it a THIRD time. Football has its weird ways to play out like this game we won and honestly I think I take the three points with happiness just because when is Juventus butt that is sitting on the other end believe me the opposition wont care either.
Personally I want another tittle but be aware that the league itself fell on class compared to the 90s and is slowly building up to what it was and back then Juventus didnt have it hard either. It look easie because we had El Capitan Del Piero and this Juve is still missing that.

Really…what is there to upgrade too? We added Tevez, Llorente, & Ogbonna. Tevez is an amazing player, Llorente will get there, and while this forum seems to be split on Ogbonna, he’s not only got my blessing, but has exceeded my expectations.
Our defense was the second best in Europe, our midfield possibly the best. Many other teams would kill to have our strikers.

Sure i wouldnt mind a top lwb who could contribute both at attacking and defending at high level of play, but other than that this team isnt lacking much. Our defense is world class even if they have been a bit shaky lately. We have 4 worldclass central midfielders, plus Asamoah and Isla, 2 players whom can cover those roles very well. And for strikers, we have a beastly Tevez; Vooch, our best striker for the last 2 years(even if he can be inconsistent); Llorente, a great target man(i assume from what i read) when he finds his rythm; Quags, a great goal getter and Gio(i still have faith in him).

We have one of the best goalkeeper in the world, and his understudy is a player who would be a first choice GK in more than half of the teams in Serie A. While his second understudy has an awesome unibrow. (ok, scratch that last sentence)
We have one of the best defense in the world with BBC – collectively and individually. They’re not showing it right now though, but the last 2 seasons should be enough proof. Their understudies are not too shabby either, Italian and Uruguayan internationals (bar Peluso).
Our midfield ranks in the top 3-5 in the world, with 4 awesome worldclass midfielders (a bit thin though).
Our offense was the main weakness, but that was reinforced with Tevez and Llorente.
Our only “weakness” now is in the wing. While Lichtsteiner and Asamoah are great WB, they don’t offer much going forward. But, then again, the only players I could think of that would produce the same defensive solidity as them and still be awesome going forward when playing WB are two retired Brazilian players: Roberto Carlos, and Cafu. <— my main reason to think that 3-5-2 is not the way forward.",Refly ,"Sep 26, 2013 ", 12:23 AM,

Juventus 2 - Chievo 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 25, 2013, 3:05pm PDT",A few thoughts,"- Godawful match, but I think the performance itself is not as bad as people made it out to be. Offensively, we didn’t create much (which I have already mentioned many many times before, is a problem when we rely only on Pirlo for creativity), true, but Conte already know that because, imagine this, he benched Bonucci, Vidal, Tevez, Vucinic. Now tell me how much creativity those 4 players give to the team? It’s not a coincidence that our “best” games happen when these 4 (and Pirlo+Pogba) play together from the start. Simply put, Conte took a risk, started an XI which he already knew will have difficulty breaking down the opposition. What he didn’t know, was that defensively, we’d be fucking things up. More precisely, Buffon fucking things up (although I partly blame Ogbonna for the first goal). Aside from the fuck ups, we didn’t really concede much to Chievo.
- Ref and linesman made a horrible, horrible mistake. There’s simply no excuse for that poor decision. No excuse. We should’ve gone down 2-1, and we might have ended up drawing the game, but it’d be deserved. Now, this is not an excuse or justification for that mistake, but the ref did ignore most calls which should’ve gone our way in the last 15 minutes or so. He might have hoped that 2 wrongs will make a right… In this case, there were about 40 wrongs, one of them huge.
- We’ve been going behind first for 4 games in a row, before we chased the games and occassionally reversed the scoreline. This is partly, maybe, because of lack of concentration, lack of tenacity early on during the games, or even underestimating the opposition a bit. But I feel that this is also because our oppositions played with extremely high tempo in the first half. It’s not a coincidence that we always manage to chase the game: our players have better conditioning, better stamina. The 2 goals that we scored came from Pogba’s cross, but if we look closely, it was because the Chievo defense had lapses in concentration. In the first half, Quags wouldn’t have been unmarked when Pogba made that cross. Llorente wouldn’t have been able to pull away which forced Bernardini to desperately stretched his legs to prevent a clear chance for Llorente. That’s why I was still cautiously optimistic despite starting the 2nd half one goal behind. I did think that we wouldn’t get the 3 points when Paloschi scored.
- As Danny mentioned above, Llorente suffers from the tight marking imposed by Chievo. This is something that he has never experienced before in La Liga, and this is part of his adaptation process. All in all, he surprised me against Hellas, but this is actually the level of performance I was expecting from Llorente in the early stage of his Juventus career.
- Speaking about Llorente, him and Quags just don’t work, at least not yet. They often attack the same space, eliminating option for the passer/crosser. Many times I see Pogba, Isla, and Peluso sending a cross only to find Llorente and Quags both moving towards the near post. Quags, I feel, should have been the one who holds back his run just in case of a cutback low cross was delivered (a la Asamoah vs Inter). But he made the exact same run with Llorente, making it redundant. Hopefully this is merely because they have never played together, and that it would improve with time.

2) The amount of second chance balls in the box is the reason for half the goals aloud so far. clear your lines and never watch the bloody ball follow the man in the area.
3)Isla has had far to much opportunity and estegarebia is looking better currently ( a joke but still like that guy…work horse) . Isla is a dream for an offensive player to run at as he has zero chance of stopping an attacker and he has literally got people on here praising Peluso’s 20% cross efficiency as quality, as his currently sits around 8-10% and thats just getting it into the box not an effective ball.

2. Pirlo wasn’t bad, he was ugly, the sooner he realizes that he cant always play, the better, for we all need him always in good shape.
3. Tell me again how bad Chiellini’s passes are, his passing accuracy was good from what I saw.
4. Pogba is one sexy beast, his talent is unlimited, and its up to Conte and mostly to himself to unleash his true beast form.
6. The no goal call was wrong, someone was standing offside but he didn’t have anything to do with the build up to the goal, then again we also deserve some calls before and after the no goal call, so eventually it’s balances out.

I’m pretty consistent with checking out the post game states on WhoScored, and as far as I can remember, Chiellini’s pass completion % most always tend to be at a minimum of the high 80’s, and most of the time in the 90’s (which is good for a quality defender).

The club held its Board of Directors meeting today and approved the draft financial statements for the financial year endind June 30 2013.
Although it closed with a loss of €15.9m, this was significantly less than the €48.6m of the previous financial year.
Much of that was helped by a 32.8 per cent increase in revenues, which climbed to €70m, of which €65.3m were down to television and radio rights for the Champions League.
There was also an increase in operating costs of €20.8m, 10 per cent more than the financial year 2011-12.
The total Juventus debt as of June 30 2013 stood at €160.3m.
This statement also confirmed the Bianconeri saved €1.9m in wages by terminating Lucio’s contract in December 2012.

You could argue that Llorente has lost his finishing touch during last year, but I think our only real eveidence to base this on, the game against Verona, proved different, although it is of course stil too early to judge. As for Quagliarella, his shot/goal ratio might be not so good, but that’s mainly due to his preference of shooting from 30 meters away from goal. If he acutally gets a good chance inside the box, he tends to finish it, at least way more often than Giovinco or Vucinic.

I think if Ogbonna can live up to his potential I believe he can become better than Chiellini on the left side of our defense because he’s more talented and got more pace to deal with quicker players.
Llorente did well not great but a good start. I saw glimpses of what he can bring to the table, he held the ball up well and played some neat touches to his teammates. One play in particular that in my head is when he put Bonucci through on goal with a nice 1 2 give an go.
Tevez is already becoming our go to guy and as long as he’s scoring and testing the keeper I’m all for him having a go. He’s the striker of always dream of playing for Juve ever since his time at Boca. He’s a match made in heaven with the Old Lady.

He is opportunistic and knows when to go for the jugular, however, so it might seem to be the case – but he knows when the angle is there and when it isn’t. Apache could’ve had 3 yesterday, and if you read lips whenever he blasts one over wide or over the traversa he yells ‘Putana’, it makes me laugh and takes the sting out of an opportunity missed. In any event, his first hat trick is just waiting to happen. If he plays both matches vs Sassuolo we are talking about 2013-14 Capocannoniere.
I never objected to giving him il numero dieci, in fact applauded the decision and he has already proven without a shadow of a doubt it was the correct decision. Tevez plays the game the right way, the Juventus way, and he earned my 100% respect, I haven’t felt the passion so palpable and emanate from the pitch since the days of Nedved. I am going to the Lazio match (in Janurary in Rome) and proudly wearing a Tevez 10 shirt, fuck the consquences.
Llorente will be a force in Serie A I have no doubt – we’re talking about eventually being a 15-18 per goal prima punta. He his very adept at hold up play, his feet are quick and he’s surprisingly nimble for a big man and will allow Tevez to really drop deep and few players do it better than him. He’s a very disciplined player as well. Match fitness is indeed an area that needs reinforcing but for 65’ he looked sharp, made some nice tight passes in close space, I contend Conte indeed made the right call by featuring him in this game. For all we know, Conte may have told him weeks ago this would be his chance and he made the most of it. Very very pleased with his debut in black and white. So much to look forward to.
I always watch Juve matches twice – once live, and then a second time with an eye on tactics – but my son was recorded the Derby della Capitale and not the Hellas match, I went to watch it again and cried like Balzaretti when I couldn’t find it on the DVR!

I really believe that Tevez has found a manager who suits his personal style of play well; a manager whose own grinta and determination defined his career as a player and now demands that from his players in turn.",dweb ,"Sep 23, 2013 ", 6:50 AM,

Ogbonna looked really comfortable on the ball, MUCH better on the left than what we say days earlier. Pirlo was marked out by Jorginho and this allowed for Bonucci and Ogbonna to come forward. Vidal looked much better and Pogba looked good but he held onto the ball for too long in some offensive plays. Isla and Asa were solid. Tevez was Tevez and Llorente scored and made men, women and children alike swoon over his piercing eyes as he celebrated. Happy for him and hope it gives him a confidence boost. Only know that Storari played because I saw him during Verona’s goal.
The subs: Marchisio looked sharp, so happy he’s back. Gio looked decent would’ve liked to see him get more minutes but what didn’t help him though was Vucinic who was terrible he’s either great when subbing or absolutely the worst. Was selfish and he looked slow.

Was really impressed with Llorente and Isla. Asa needs to work on his crossing, both finding space and the delivery.
It’s great to see so many chances being created and I believe it’s just a matter of time before we start really converting.
Do we have to bitch and complain about our players every fucking week. First it was Marchisio after he got hurt with, Pogba is going to take is place and it’s time to sell. Guess what, Pogba hasn’t stepped enough as far as I’m concerned to take the princes spot. Yeah Pirlo looks a bit quiet lately but think about it for a minute. Serie A is extremely tactical. How many games do you think opposing teams watch of Juve’s, especially the teams who are coming to Turin not to lose. For the past 2 years where has most of our play been run through, Pirlo.

- This is not the right game to assess our defense. Verona basically defended with 10 man, and we have 3 vs 1 advantage on the back. While I agree that Chiellini has been horrible (I did ask for Ogbonna to be played rather than Chiellini last night), this game alone doesn’t mean that Ogbonna should get the starting spot ahead of Chiellini.
- Many write off Pirlo, and say that he sucked last night. I personally agree with CRASHY. Pirlo was man marked by Jorginho all night long, and Verona basically asked us to play 10 vs 10 instead of 11 vs 11. Pirlo, tactically intelligent as he is, moved wide to pull the marker and allowed Ogbonna and/or Bonucci to move way forward to create a numerical advantage down the middle. This is the advantage of having Ogbonna instead of Chiellini: more comfortable on the ball. But back to the point, Pirlo didn’t suck. He was man marked, and decided that the best way to influence the game is to allow his other teammates more freedom. He sacrificed his own desire to play ball, and ran around instead to open up spaces. Did you think he enjoyed it? No. But he still did it, all for the team.
- Continuing on the above, Verona sacrificed their most creative player for our most creative player, and parked the rest of the team in front of their penalty box to prevent Bonucci’s long searching ball behind the D, which worked, despite his 1 assist. They bet on their ability to cover space and limit clear cut chances. They only made one simple miscalculation. Well, 2 miscalculations, really: Tevez and Llorente.
- Barzagli was immense. If nobody noticed, he was covering the high backline all by himself, right left center, while Bonucci and Ogbonna helped on the offense. He basically man marked Cacia and prevented him to be the reference for Verona. Tell me that isn’t amazing: a 32 year old defender preventing counter attacks all by himself.
- Llorente did extremely well last night, way better than I had expected. 2 points to note, though: 1) this is Verona we’re talking about, and should not be used as a measuring stick; 2) his fitness level is still lacking, you can see that he was huffing and puffing when he was subbed out. Getting tired around the hour mark is no good. He needs to work on his energy level, and/or improve his tactical understanding to make his movement more efficient.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 22, 2013 ", 8:22 PM,

Juventus 2 - Hellas Verona 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 22, 2013, 9:25am PDT",Some additions,"- Pirlo was man marked out of the way. Given this scenario, 99 out of 100 would expect Pogba to provide the creative spark in the middle of the park. Yet I think he didn’t manage to assert himself last night. Rather subdued performance from him, and to make it worse, he still doesn’t chase back when Verona was counter attacking. His growth has been amazing, but now he needs to gain one very difficult ability: consistency. I hear you say, he’s only 20 years old, and I understand. But if he wants to be the undisputable starter, then he needs to improve, regardless of his age.
- As the discussion circled around Pogba, it’s only apt that the next point is to talk about Marchisio. He really showed how to close up space quickly and effectively. Of course, he was fresh when he came in while Verona’s players are visibly more tired, so this was a factor too. Also, on offensive phase, Marchisio is very quick in his distribution, never stopping the ball for more than 3 seconds. He may not affect the game much, but let me say this to you, he’s the 2nd most intelligent player in the whole Juventus team, only losing to Pirlo. If you can’t see it, then you can’t see it.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 22, 2013 ", 8:32 PM,

Juventus 2 - Hellas Verona 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 22, 2013, 9:25am PDT",,"To say it is one thing. To actually do it is quite another. Pogba has the best climate to learn, he’s basically surrounded by world class CMs, and coached by a relentless perfectionist (who himself was a CM). I’m just hoping he truly realizes that he still has lots and lots of room to grow, and not get satisfied with what he has achieved. It is still difficult to define what kind of CM Pogba is, and this is something that is faced by all young player: what kind of player do you want to be? Obviously the coach plays a big role in this aspect. If Conte asks him to be a vice Pirlo, he’ll obviously try to be a vice Pirlo. But he has to trust his instinct and develop his own skillset, aligned with what he thinks he does best. He can’t play different roles everytime he gets on to the field, lest he be a jack of all trade, which will be a waste considering his mercurial talent. He needs to define what kind of a player he is, while still taking into account the need of the team, and the advise of the people around him. Right now, I can’t decide just what is Pogba the CM, and what will he become. It’s exciting and worrying at the same time…",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 22, 2013 ", 10:49 PM,

- Is it some new tactic or because of Verona sitting very deep that Bonucci dare to spend more time in the opposition area. Pirlo got marked thus if Pirlo move to the right or left then the central area become empty because Verona player keep on following him, that makes Bonucci has some space to move forward

Their goal was very similar to the one we conceded angainst Copenhagen, maybe something the team needs to work on. Other than that, great game overall, although finishing remains somewhat ofa liability. We could easily lead by 3 goals with all the chances created.
Random thoughts:
-Veronas defending leads to our Cbs coming up very far the pitch.

 I m not sure what he is playing at, but, at the moment it’s coming off in a stupid way. I hope he has alot more up his sleeve, but so far this season, he hasnt proved he is interested in Europe.

If you really think that Conte talks like that when he’s motivating his players, then you don’t know him. And I don’t know how this ends up going back to the US tour. Conte is a Coverciano graduate. He’s wired to treat friendly as a friendly, pre season as a pre season, and actual games as actual games. Look at Prandelli’s Italy. See a pattern? Conte wants to win (I thought you know this), but he wants to win when IT MATTERS, when IT IS WRITTEN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. He is focused, and thinks long term. He cancelled our US tour last season because of Super Coppa. Haven’t that given you some insight on what the guy is like? Why are you surprised that he didn’t care about the US tour???
He hasn’t proven he is interested in Europe? Well, how should he prove it then? By playing the primavera against Inter? By sacrificing Serie A and betting it all on the UCL the By going 2-3-5 against Copenhagen? He’s being realistic when he says we’re aiming for the 2nd spot behind Real. It’s not like he said we will definitely lose against Real, no? Based on paper, we are indeed behind Real. That’s anonymously agreed, and I don’t even think you can argue that we are better than Real at the moment. But if we ended up top, do you think he will say it’s not deserved? If we win 4-0 in the Bernabeu, do you think he will not say the better team won?
This is his management style. He takes the pressure off from his players. It’s how these players stay loyal to him, how he convince them to do what he asks, because they know that they can rely on him. That if things go south, he won’t blame them. He won’t throw them under the bus. I don’t know why he keeps surprising you guys, because this has been obvious since the get go, from the first day he came to Juventus.
The same goes about his “situation” with Marotta and Agnelli. Many like to imagine a power struggle between the 3. Is it really difficult to believe that they are all working with each other, working out on disagreements, compromising, and agree on important decisions together? You know, just like on any other institutions?

The way I see it is this, Serie A has become competitive and not just because of Napoli or Inter but because Italy is required to become what it used to and when the chips are layed down everyone will spend and will be more ambitious and as for Europe Italy has not place on it yet because of the economy many Italian teams cant afford to be in debt or it will become Spain and a dull league with a three to four team league(yes I said it)
I have faith in Juve and if things dont go as planned this season I know this, I will be a fan now yesterday and the rest of my life.

Trust Conte with Llorente
by Football Italia3 hours ago
Huddle
Fernando Llorente got up off the bench and started his warm-up. The plucky Danes, aided by an inspired goalkeeper and some sloppy finishing, were becoming annoyingly resilient. Fabio Quagliarella had equalised to get Juventus back into the tie, but settling for a point at the start of a Champions League campaign against a side of the meagre calibre of FC Copenhagen was never an option for the Italians.
After 76 minutes of seeing Quagliarella and Carlos Tevez struggle to give the Old Lady an advantage that their play deserved, boss Antonio Conte opted for a change. The stage – according to more than one report on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning – was set for Llorente to come on and save the day, an imposing centre-forward who could get physical in the box. Instead, the 44-year-old opted to replace Quagliarella with the little Sebastian Giovinco.
“I made some players warm up, including Llorente and Giovinco, as I wanted to see how the game was going to develop,” Conte stated after the tie ended 1-1. “Against a side with players who are strong in the air but slow, it would be stupid to play with tall forwards. Tevez, Quagliarella and Giovinco gave them the most problems, as they are shorter and quicker.”
It was a reasonable explanation from the former midfielder, or at least it should have been. But when a tactical switch is made that doesn’t produce the desired effects then a Coach, no matter who he is, will be questioned. And by ignoring Llorente, Conte inevitably made sure that the big Spaniard would again be making the headlines after another snub.
Juventus announced the Bosman free signing of the 28-year-old in January, six months before his arrival. An international striker, he bagged 85 goals in 262 League games for Athletic Bilbao. He may not have been the top player in attack who Juve were looking for, but he was clearly a forward who could be useful to the cause over the course of a long, hard season.
Llorente, however, arrived in Turin after a problematic campaign. His refusal to sign a new contract in Bilbao saw him marginalised from the first team. Without regular action, the Lion King inevitably lost his roar.
Expectations in Italy, however, were still high. And following the later capture of Tevez from Manchester City, Juventus would supposedly start the term with a front two of the Spaniard and the Argentine. Pre-season experiments certainly suggested as much, with Mirko Vucinic – a better player than Fernando but without his eye for goal – relegated to first reserve. By the time the season proper got underway, Vucinic was back in the team and Llorente was out.
“Juventus was the best decision for me,” Llorente said in August. “But I need to adapt and it will take time. The Coach uses me as an attacker in his 3-5-2, so I will need to improve my movement and understanding with my teammates. I need to do things which I haven’t done in the past, but things will improve. I am doing all that is possible to integrate myself into the team’s way of playing.”
In five official games so far this season, Llorente has been used just once – as an 89th minute substitute in the Week 1 win over Sampdoria. Those are stats which fuel the Caso Llorente stories, ones which predictably talk about a quick move away – either in January or at the end of the season.
The official club line is rather different. “I can categorically deny any problem,” stated director general Beppe Marotta who, according to Gazzetta salary figures, handed him a deal worth €3.5m a season. “We signed a player on a free transfer after carefully evaluating his qualities. Don’t forget that he basically hasn’t played for a year and he needs time. We’ve signed him on a four-year deal because we believe in him and we will wait for him.”
Conte too, prior to the Copenhagen game, asked for patience. “He’s just getting back after a year out and I need to play him when he can shine. I can’t put him on the field of play if he isn’t in a position to give his maximum just to keep the journalists happy.”
In response to the soundbites from Turin are media whispers that Conte doesn’t think the Spaniard can fit into his way of football, which requires a certain mobility in his forwards, or that he didn’t want the player in the first place. Such accusations are yet to be confirmed, especially as they prematurely come in the month of September.
The only certainty right now is that it is too soon to call time on Llorente’s spell with Juventus. He might not have yet convinced Conte, but ‘yet’ is the key word. If the Coach truly felt he had no need for the forward, then he’s shown with Reto Ziegler that he would have no hesitation in telling the club so.
The most striking feature though in this whole Llorente affair is that the decision making of Conte is being questioned. After taking a side who finished seventh in consecutive seasons to winning back-to-back titles, it’s pretty safe to say that Antonio knows how to judge a player. Don’t forget, it wasn’t too long ago when La Signora would take to the field of play with Christian Poulsen, Tiago and Amauri in their ranks.
After returning the Old Lady to their rightful place where their history suggests they deserve to be, there has to be a trust in a Coach who bleeds black and white. He makes decisions in the interests of winning a game, not to pamper to the club’s summer transfer campaign as the recent examples of Ziegler and Eljero Elia testify. If Llorente wants a game there is only one way of getting one – to impress on the training field. And as Conte sees him on a daily basis, it’s only right that the ultimate decision is left to him.",nickdill40 ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 6:11 AM,

He may not have been the top player in attack who Juve were looking for, but he was clearly a forward who could be useful to the cause over the course of a long, hard season.
Llorente, however, arrived in Turin after a problematic campaign. His refusal to sign a new contract in Bilbao saw him marginalised from the first team. Without regular action, the Lion King inevitably lost his roar.
Expectations in Italy, however, were still high. And following the later capture of Tevez from Manchester City, Juventus would supposedly start the term with a front two of the Spaniard and the Argentine. Pre-season experiments certainly suggested as much, with Mirko Vucinic – a better player than Fernando but without his eye for goal – relegated to first reserve. By the time the season proper got underway, Vucinic was back in the team and Llorente was out.
“Juventus was the best decision for me,” Llorente said in August. “But I need to adapt and it will take time. The Coach uses me as an attacker in his 3-5-2, so I will need to improve my movement and understanding with my teammates. I need to do things which I haven’t done in the past, but things will improve. I am doing all that is possible to integrate myself into the team’s way of playing.”
In five official games so far this season, Llorente has been used just once – as an 89th minute substitute in the Week 1 win over Sampdoria. Those are stats which fuel the Caso Llorente stories, ones which predictably talk about a quick move away – either in January or at the end of the season.
The official club line is rather different. “I can categorically deny any problem,” stated director general Beppe Marotta who, according to Gazzetta salary figures, handed him a deal worth €3.5m a season. “We signed a player on a free transfer after carefully evaluating his qualities. Don’t forget that he basically hasn’t played for a year and he needs time. We’ve signed him on a four-year deal because we believe in him and we will wait for him.”
Conte too, prior to the Copenhagen game, asked for patience. “He’s just getting back after a year out and I need to play him when he can shine. I can’t put him on the field of play if he isn’t in a position to give his maximum just to keep the journalists happy.”
In response to the soundbites from Turin are media whispers that Conte doesn’t think the Spaniard can fit into his way of football, which requires a certain mobility in his forwards, or that he didn’t want the player in the first place. Such accusations are yet to be confirmed, especially as they prematurely come in the month of September.
The only certainty right now is that it is too soon to call time on Llorente’s spell with Juventus. He might not have yet convinced Conte, but ‘yet’ is the key word. If the Coach truly felt he had no need for the forward, then he’s shown with Reto Ziegler that he would have no hesitation in telling the club so.
The most striking feature though in this whole Llorente affair is that the decision making of Conte is being questioned. After taking a side who finished seventh in consecutive seasons to winning back-to-back titles, it’s pretty safe to say that Antonio knows how to judge a player. Don’t forget, it wasn’t too long ago when La Signora would take to the field of play with Christian Poulsen, Tiago and Amauri in their ranks.
After returning the Old Lady to their rightful place where their history suggests they deserve to be, there has to be a trust in a Coach who bleeds black and white. He makes decisions in the interests of winning a game, not to pamper to the club’s summer transfer campaign as the recent examples of Ziegler and Eljero Elia testify. If Llorente wants a game there is only one way of getting one – to impress on the training field. And as Conte sees him on a daily basis, it’s only right that the ultimate decision is left to him.",nickdill40 ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 6:12 AM,

Many have suggested formation changes, most of which resulting from the draw against Copenhagen.
Regardless, there has been a mass appeal for a 4-3-3, a formation which we currently lack the ample tools for. No quality LB or natural wingers with pace. Gio can play left, but still leaves a hole on the right. It would make sense as a means to capitalize on Llorentes strengths, but it diminishes Tevez’s attributes. Tevez has an immense work rate, and can cover the pitch from flank to flank, and is the creative player in attack, so its better suited for him to play as a CF so he can cover a larger area. Once Llorente gets a chance to get back into.the groove, I think a partnership of two forwards rather than a single Target man is more productive to our philosophy.
Another option is a minor change in formation, going from a 3-5-2 (3-1-4-2) to a 3-5-2 (3-4-1-2) or 3-4-3 (3-4-2-1).
The former would sacrifice a deep lying playmaker (Pirlo) for a CAM. I wouldn’t necessarily consider this as a something go replace 3-5-2, but it is preferable when we need an in game change against stubborn defenses and is better than bringing in Padoin for Pirlo. Pogba can play in the advanced position, with Vidal and Marchisio being responsible for more defensive duties, as they are better in that regards. It would also allow for a combination of Llorente, Tevez, Vucinic, or Gio to play together, with one of the latter 3 playing in behind the two strikers.
The Second option: again the regista is removed for another attacking player. This formation will allow for more interplay to and from the flanks while still preserving creativity closer to the center. It allows Llorente to play as a lone striker with two forwards/AM in a deeper role pushed slightly closer to the flanks but more central than true wingers. It would also remove some of the attacking responsibility from the wingbacks, as the two forwards would have more freedom to venture wide.
Also keep in mind that both formations prserve the chemistry of a 3 man back line, allowing for Bonucci to be at his best, while still maintaining the use of wingbacks.",Nuncio#7 ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 11:58 AM,
Waiting for Fernando Llorente to make an impact at Juventus,Danny Penza,"Sep 19, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"You’re quite right, the 3-5-2 was NOT the reason for the draw, and there has definitely been a broad appeal to at least use a 4-3-3 once in a while.
While I agree to an extent that we “lack the ample tools” to play that formation, we do have players that we can try in that area. The first position to address would be LB, as you noted. I think honestly Asamoah can be converted to play there. After all, he brings more defensive stability, which would help in a 4 man back line. Additionally, we have Caceres who plays that position naturally for his country. Dare I also suggest that we do have PDC as well, whos natural position is LB. Either way, 1 of those 3 makeshift options would definitely suffice from time to time.
The next position to address would be the wide attackers/wingers. True, we don’t have any natural wingers. However, I’d LOVE to see Vucinic play on the left. I’ve said this a million times, in that position he would be truly great. Llorente/Tevez/Qualiarella could all potentially play as a prima punta, and each one has their own unique attributes. From the right wing, Pepe would be a no brainer if he’s ever back up to even 80% of his form, and Giovinco can also play there as well.
The one thing I really like about the 4-3-3, (or really any formation that involves a 4 man backline) is that it is SO much easier to purchase players who fit the system. Consider the fact that nearly no team outside of Italy plays with a 3 man back line, which makes its very difficult to find quality wing backs. In the open market, finding quality wingers/LB’s/RB’s is quite easy. Plus it makes it easier for other players to adapt to our system because most likely they’d already be used to playing some sort of formation involving a 4 man back line.
I have an in depth write up saved on my comp about the last game, but cutting to the point, I don’t want to be labeled a heretic, but playing Pogba as a CAM, and sacrificing Pirlo would be all good by me. I’m not saying it’s something that should be done overnight, but over the course of the next 1-2 seasons. It all goes back to what I just said in the last paragraph…think about how many registas in the game there actually are….3-5-2 is a difficult formation to find and integrate QUALITY talent into.
Kind of jumping around here, but for the time being, yes, it’s probably a prudent idea to keep our 3 CB’s due to their attributes, but I’d have to imagine that within the next season or 2, Barzagli will no longer be as good as he is. I could definitely see the future as Ogbonna – Bonucci as the two CB’s.
Taking about formations…how about some sort of 4-1-4-1?
’Steiner – Barzagli (Bonucci) – Chiellini (Ogbonna) – Caceres (PDC)
Pirlo
Vidal – Pogba – Marchisio – Asamoah
Llorente
Anyway, I digress. I think the 3-5-2 is here to stay, at least for the time being. I do truly hope that at some point in time (sooner rather than later) that Conte will be able to play the formation HE wants to play, or envisions rather. Someone here said this a while back (JD maybe along with some other peps?), but the thing that made Conte so good when he came on board is that he was able to recognize the strengths of the team and adjusted by moving to the 3-5-2. Two seasons later, I think we’re past that point. Now he needs to start thinking about what his vision is, and work with management to evolve the team into that formation.",MatteoX ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 12:45 PM,

I’d be all for playing Pogba in a more advanced position – that’s probably where he’d thrive. The only issue with moving Pogba to a CAM and removing Pirlo from the equation is that perhaps we might suffer in not having a single person to really dictate the tempo and orchestrate the game. I suppose what you are suggesting is really more of a modified 3-4-1-2, with Pogba playing in a more advanced position. I also think Giovinco could play in that role as well.

Waiting for Fernando Llorente to make an impact at Juventus,Danny Penza,"Sep 19, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"People tens to forget that the 3-5-2 was in large part responsible for our team’s success these pat 2 seasons. Those who say that Conte is too rigid to change his tactics either ignore or forget that he was a proponent of the 4-2-4, then when he came to Juve, he opted for the 4-3-3 to suit Pirlo as well as MV. Further time with the tram, he realized that the 3-5-2 maximizes the players’ collective attributes and went with that. Let’s not also forget rhe 3-5-1-1, although a subtle change, he dis it to incorporate Pogba with the MVP. Now those critically should ask themselves if Conte is still to hard headed and sure of himself to play his 3-5-2 regularly.
Matteo I agree with you that some formation with a 4 man back line should.be experimented with time to time a la 4-3-3, 4-1-4-1, or 4-3-2-1, but as of now, with the injuries and issues with form, I don’t see that happening soon. Still, some alterations to the 3-5-2 would not hurt when we need to emphasize an aspect of our game, whether its a more defensive, aggressive, or balanced strategy. I would really like to see the 3-4-1-2 with MVPogba as I feel that Pogba, nor anyone on our roster can replace Pirlo’s role with all the nuances of his game. Pogba has a lot to offer offensively, but his defensive game needs work, so I think he’d be great in an advances position… Deadly combo to deal with Pogba’s long shots, close control, and strength with Marchisio’s ghost like runs and Vidal’s beastlyness and potency in front of goal. If were ever on the back pedal during the counter, MVPogba has the speed and endurance to hustle back, and they’re better defensively than Pirlo. This aould.be the season to try this out, not as a means of taking Pirlo out completely, as he has a lot to offer ebb well rested and fit. This should give Conte time to rest one of his greatest weapons, butif he doesnt take the time to clean out the bore of his rifle, it becomes inaccurate and can backfire, as weve seen it done.

Quags was invisible in the first half, and basically Copenhagen was inviting crosses in. If Llorente had come in, it might have forced them to change their approach. Like it or not, Llorente has some characteristic that none of our other strikers have.
I thought it would be a good tactical move. But I’m just an ordinary fans and not the coach, so if Conte wants to use the battering ram to open the steal door rather than trying other means (lockpick, or just blow the goddamn door with a bomb, etc), then who am I to say he’s wrong? Anyway it’s proven by Quags goal, and the plethora of chances that we got in the 2nd half that his approach could’ve worked.

Juventus 1 - FC Copenhagen 1: Instant reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 17, 2013, 3:00pm PDT",,"Just to put things in context in regards to my last suggestion of keeping matri, perhaps the fact that for the celtics game he was the one that opened the score. Say what you want but without Matri and Vucinic 2011-2012 season would’ve not been as good as it did.( come on undefeated)
Keeping that in mind if I remember you cant have players playing all the time because of fatigue, and thus Conte saw Matris performance go downhill, but that lead to him losing his starting position. After that Conte opted for Giovinco and look what happened he is now benched.
This season could’ve been different but if either Conte or the juventus board of directors keep on changing the pieces how do you expect for the team to play fluidly? Example look at barcelona they kept key players and it has worked.
Say what you want about Matri, he was a good part of the club even Krasic and I’ll be bold to say that Giacherini should’ve not being sold.
The Llorente issue yes we can agree with Conte he is not ready mentaly but keeping him from action will wear down his ambitions to even try to play for the club and his morale will hit a point were he no longer would want to play for the club.

Mind you, this is not the first match he has played poorly. He was good in Super Coppa but has been shaky since he got skinned by Gabbiadini in the first match. Chiellini’s off-form has a cascading effect. He is the only old fashioned ball winner in our back-line and with him messing up Vidal has to do more closing down in midfield. There is even more pressure on Vidal given how Pirlo is often losing possession and Pogba doesn’t have Marchisio’s tactical discipline. With Vidal having to do more defensive work in midfield his box to box runs have lessened, which is hitting us upfront.

Juventus 1 - FC Copenhagen 1: Instant reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 17, 2013, 3:00pm PDT",,"My fury has subsided into mere disappointment thanks to some hard Taekwondo contact sparring (atonement?) but leaving 2 points in Copenhagen is shameful. My quick takeaway:
-My only concern going into last night’s match was taking them too lightly, and when Jorgensen scored 14’ into it I think it is apparent they did.
 
-It’s not like Juve’s defense was at 6’s and 7’s at the back, one Chiellini miscue and we’re down a goal. It happens once, we call it a lapse. A second time in a week, it is a concern. Ogbonna’s bad back pass would’ve been unforgivable, that can’t ever happen.
-Tevez and Q together should’ve been more than ample firepower, between the hitting the traversa and Wiland, not to mention Pogba, Chiellini and Licht not capitalizing, this should have been 3-1, 4-1. Missed chances isn’t the same as inability to create chances. In contrast, Los Blancos go to Istanbul and score six times. (Anyone know the extent of Drogba’s shoulder?) Somebody mentioned on the stream Juve should attend a finishing bootcamp. That is exactly what this team needs, Vucinic doing all drills twice..
-Peluso. He played surprisingly well. I criticized that move but he held his own, made some strong crosses. Can he replicate the same against tougher foes is the question, one I still don’t want answered. On the panchina for the heavyweights, please.
-After our umpteenth corner I noted that inserting a 6’5"" striker seemed to make sense. Conte has a plan regarding when to (eventually) play him, and clearly he’s sticking to it, but in the process is only allowing pressure to mount on Llorente. For his sake I hope he gets minutes at home vs Verona on Sunday, the whole self-induced ‘controversy’ if you want to call it that can simply be put to rest by giving him some minutes..",Tre Stelline ,"Sep 18, 2013 ", 4:43 AM,

Juventus 1 - FC Copenhagen 1: Instant reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 17, 2013, 3:00pm PDT",,"Peluso’s performance was deceiving, IMO. Copenhagen playing out of the 4-4-2 completely forfeited the flanks to Juve in order to be more compact in midfield and defense. Because of that most of Peluso’s runs were completely uncontested and he seemed to always find himself in acres of space. I don’t recall him once taking on his man, because there was simply no one marking him. The crosses he did put in were quite good, and ultimately lead to a goal.
I could also wage the argument, that due to Peluso’s defensive liability as (comparative to Asamoah), and Pogba’s weak defensive skills (comparative to Marchisio) that the whole left hand side was not as tactically strong from a defensive perspective. This surely will put increased pressure on Chiellini.
Another thing, I hold Peluso party responsible for the goal as well (along with Chiellini). He was also “marking” Jorgensen and failed to notice him slipping in.
My point I suppose is that Peluso isn’t a top caliber player, and this is nothing we don’t already know. I think he’s best implemented in the case of; squad rotation against lower tier league teams, coppa games; substitute in the case of many injuries; or coming in off the bench to bring a bit more of attacking spark..",MatteoX ,"Sep 18, 2013 ", 7:59 AM,

His weekness is suppose to be his offensive ability but yesterday he was delivering some beautiful dangerous crosses. I hope to God he holds a class to teach Asamoah and Lichtsteiner how to deliver a proper cross.

He had always been known as a 4-2-4 (4-4-2) coach, but felt his personnel was better suited to the other two formations. Last year we were very much a 3-5-2 team because Conte felt the loss of Pepe limited the teams ability to effectively switch to a 4-3-3. Pepe continues to be injured, we haven’t bought any true wingers, and now we don’t even have Giach. Those are the reasons why he has been so adamant about the 3-5-2. You can disagree with him if you want to about whether we have the personnel for a 4-3-3, but it makes little sense to say he is too arrogant to switch formations given what we already know. Besides, sticking to 1 formation is not necessarily a bad thing. Bayern has played the same formation for years now.
We lost yesterday because (1) we were unbelievably wasteful, and (2) it is clear we didn’t come out with the right mindset from the beginning. That is concerning because we should have learned our lesson when we were in Copehagen last year. That sort of attitude reared its ugly head in the preseason too, which bothered me.
Marchisio’s worth to this team is most evident when he isn’t playing. I love Pogba, but Marchisio’s presence i’m sure is reassuring for the defense. We need and Pepe to come back at 100%.",Palomao ,"Sep 18, 2013 ", 4:52 PM,

firstly, idk why everyone is blaming Conte and his formation for the draw(that feels like a loss). How exactly did Conte or his formation cost us the game? Please tell me. The last time i checked, we conceded from a set play where a group of Juve players lost out on a header against one copen player, is the formation or Conte at blame for that?
I missed most of the 1st half, but saw all of the 2nd and what did i see? Juve was dominant, the scoreline doesnt say so, but we were. We had many 1v1 chances and we took numerous shots, but as usual, their damn goalie had the game of his life. So was that the formation or Contes fault? Or was it just amazing keeping? I feel like since we finally got a top striker, some fans are just looking for other ways to vent their anger and for some reason theyre blaming things on Conte.
Lastly, the criticism on Peluso is ridiculous. Im not gonna lie, his first few matches were horrible, but since his change in position to lwb, hes been a very good player, probably even great. Hes been a great attacking threat. He always gets into great positions, his crosses are nice and neat and his passing is accurate and helps our game flow.

Can’t blame the formation or Conte. Formations don’t effect whether a player can score 1v1, or off an open header or a tap in volley 2 feet from the goal. People here were giving Isla a hard time because he missed a golden chance against inter, yet it wasn’t the formation’s or Conte’s fault. Tevez, a world class player, blows a 1v1 and Pogba and Chiellini miss on their chances, but its another reason for the loss.

I think most of the frustration comes from Conte’s hesitancy to try out 4-3-3 from the pre-season. We all miss that bit from his first season where we can seemingly switch from one formation to the next to surprise the oppositions. If you were around, you would notice that even the writers here in BWRAO (Juve Offside back then) struggled to get the starting XI and formation prediction correct. Now, all opposition coaches and their mothers and their mothers’ grandmothers know that we’ll play 3-5-2. It adds a bit of predictability into our game, and because of that, we always have to be in our best to defeat our opponents, because they all come prepared to face our trademarked 3-5-2.
That’s why I don’t react to these overreactions calling for Conte’s head, because 1) it’s just overreactions, no need to overreact to overreactions, and 2) I totally understand the frustration because I too would like to see 4-3-3 become our main system in the future.
Also, that first half that you missed? It was friggin’ horrible. From the first minute to the last, it was a nightmare. We didn’t play like Juve at all. We sucked, period. The 2nd half brought much much needed improvement, but it also brought some frustration because of all the wasted chances. Anxiety piled up as minutes go by, and combine that with the news from the other UCL games, you kind of understood why we were so very disappointed. Cue the rage, the anger, and the overreaction. And as usual, rationality went out of the window, and we start to spout all the things we think is wrong with current Conte regime, even though they are not related to the game itself.

The talk of the 3-5-2 vs 4-3-3 made sense last year against Bayern, but not now. There was a big chance that if we started with a 4-3-3, we might still have ended with the same result. The main issue is the lack of ideas and lack of changes when your opponent figures your plan the first 5-10 minutes and play to their strength. This is when Conte should jump in to adjust the play, whether through personel change or formation change because screaming and throwing bottles cannot always do the trick.
I am a big critic of Conte, but I am not calling for his head. Many here are criticising Conte as well, and I’m sure many don’t want to see him go. When he wins he gets credit, when he loses it should only be right to criticise him especially when its an easy game.",Moe C ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 1:34 AM,

My main concern is in defence where Chiellini, Bonucci and Barzagli seem to be working best as a unit and absence/off-form of anyone among them leads to a weakening of the backline as a whole. They look very shaky often when they played in a 4 man defence for Italy. You can argue that Lichtsteiner is a better RB than what Italy NT has to offer but given Chiellini’s recent form I am not too confident about him as a LB. Especially since all the width in a 4-3-3 comes from full-backs and Chiellini’s overlaps have never been good to begin with.
Another concern is the lack of freedom Bonucci will get in a 2 man central defence. In a 3-5-2, he is allowed to move up more and try those long passes because he knows he has two players to cover for him should he misplace a pass or get caught out of position. That protection will be halved in a 4-3-3 and as the last match showed, Bonucci’s abilities to start moves from the back are very, very important for this team.",Somnath_Sengupta_ ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 2:03 AM,

Juventus 1 - FC Copenhagen 1: Instant reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 17, 2013, 3:00pm PDT",,"If we are to switch to 4-3-3, obviously we need to shed our 3-5-2 identity and devise a new game plan. We can’t expect the players to perform similar roles as when they play in a 3-5-2. It’s understandably difficult to have 2 different game plans (we need players who are intelligent tactically), and this is also probably why Conte is not keen on changing to 4-3-3 when 3-5-2 is still working (relatively) well. The tactical burden of switching formations is also incredibly high for defenders, who incidentally is also the main reason we played 3-5-2 (to play all 3 of BBC).
We moved to 4-3-3 to create space for MVP, and then switched to 3-5-2 to accommodate Bonucci. If we want to prepare life after Pirlo, 4-3-3 is not the logical evolution. If anything, it’d be 3-4-3. I considered 3-4-1-2, but given Conte’s historical aversion to trequartista, I find it difficult to seriously suggest that. Or maybe 3-6-1?
In any case, I think our management knows that we might need to leave 3-5-2 sometime in the future. I recall our primavera started playing 3-5-2 2 years ago, or even last year, in the effort to allow primavera players to soak in the first team tactical feature to smoothen integration if needs be. But if I’m not mistaken, our primavera no longer play 3-5-2 now. So it seems like 3-5-2 is not the long term plan, at least. I might be wrong, though.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 2:41 AM,

Juventus 1 - FC Copenhagen 1: Instant reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 17, 2013, 3:00pm PDT",There is much to be said in favour...,"…of sticking to a system which has claimed the lion-share of two domestic titles and laid the foundation for our re-emergence as any kind of force in Europe last season. Its too hard to even write the word LION without Llorente appearing in my thoughts and demanding a mention…
In a match where very obviously our opponents had set out to play to their strengths and our weaknesses, ceding control of the flanks and placing muscle and determination in a compact wall in front of their goal, we are left with two choices-
1. stick to our system but fight fire with fire, so take what is given, own the flanks, put in cross after cross after cross. Now to make something of this tactic, we must put into play our finest finisher from crosses. Ideally a target man, who can either score himself, out-jump/ out-muscle the defenders, or present a chance for a fellow player from a knock-down.
2. change tactics to attempt to draw our opponents out of shape and create openings to drive into and capitalize upon.
Matri was our best aerial threat in attack prior to his departure. If you are not Barca its always useful to have a strong man in the box. In his place, we have a new, potentially much more useful prima punta in the spaniard. The problem here is that Conte doesn’t deem him ready. Maybe he is correct. We have to take into account that its not simply a case of Llorente adjusting to our systems and players, there is also the rather poignant issue to ponder of his immense lack of playing time for the last year of his career. We are not Barcelona, although we do create and score some beautifully conjured goals. I prefer the old school approach of our forward line incorporating a duo of prima punta and fantasista. Considering we play with a huge amount of effort focused on owning the flanks and getting quality balls into the box from the flanks, it adds even more weight to the argument of playing a prima punta, a player adept at winning aerial battles, to create or finish. I remember, ever so fondly, the best of Del Piero and Trezeguet. Whilst its incredibly optimistic to suggest that Llorente is of Trezeguet’s class, we do have the option now of deploying a similar duo, for Tevez is, for me, as talented a player as Del Piero. Perhaps less fantasy, but a huge amount more work rate, muscle and clinical end product. The two are perfect for a Big man/ Little man combination. And I am sure we will see that given a run out closer to christmas…such appears Conte’s caution.
And its this idea of Conte’s caution which is the only observation, not criticism, I can offer on a coach I loved to watch as a player, and who has, more than anyone else at the club, taken us from two 7th place finishes to domestic powerhouse and respected opponent on the european stage.
The major point to focus upon is that tactically, we made a huge amount of good chances. The system was working. It was not a case at all of a failure to create goal scoring chances. If there is anything I question, its the determination and belief of the players. On the team we put out, on the large amount of chances, on form, we should have won this handsomely. We did not…Because we came up against a resolute, very well organized side and failed to convert more than one of at the very least five very good chances.
So onto this 4-3-3 discussion.
Every time I see Pogba play I believe more strongly that he is simply too good, and getting better by the week, to be left out of the midfield. Vidal is scoring goals and by now well established as one of the best box to box midfielders in the world. Pirlo’s form has been rusty, but if we take his distribution capabilities out of our line-up, our creativity, from open play and set pieces hugely diminishes. I am interested to discover the player who misses out when Marchisio returns to full fitness, regardless of a 4-3-3 or 3-5-2. I like Marchisio, yet when even taking into consideration the poor form of Pirlo, I would be strongly opposed to Pogba dropping out to bring the italian back IN. Pirlo may well need a breather, but unless he is suffering from injury I see him as starting whenever fit. So how can we integrate four top drawer midfielders?? I’d be tempted, were I the manager, to make a stab at it. For I always lean towards looking at the squad, identifying your best players, putting them in a line-up and only then picking a formation around them. Which for me, would lead us to something like this…
Buffon
Lichsteiner Barzagli Bonucci Chiellini
(flat back four…Giorgio is a monster left back and with added presence through the middle the wingback focus is greatly lessened)
Pogba
Vidal Marchisio
Pirlo
Llorente Tevez
Its a diamond midfield. My only uncertainty would be whether Pogba plays in Vidal’s role or vice versa. Even with Vucinic instead of Llorente I would go the same way.
a 4-3-3 seems viable, but who drops out of the midfield? By far our most capable on the ball Pirlo I will stick to my guns and include the strongest players in the starting XI, so avoid the issue of leaving out Pogba or Pirlo or Marchisio and play to our strengths.
On a side note, Peluso has been fine. I do not rate him highly as an offensive threat, but defensively, once he has found his feet, he is stronger than Asamoah. De Ceglie is not even worth mentioning at any length. And to continue this side note routine…Giaccherini’s insatiable hustling and potency near to goal and in the box has not been replaced. I am unsure as to why that transfer was authorized and above all else, Who had the final say, but regardless of his lack of physicality, his effort and direct focus on scoring goals has proven brilliant so many times for us, and now…he is conspicuous by his absence. I expect us to sign an attacking midfielder in January, for as much hope as people put into Pepe, of the two, the little goblin was always the most potent to my eyes and juve heart.

Juventus 1 - FC Copenhagen 1: Instant reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 17, 2013, 3:00pm PDT",It depends on how you judge a LB...,"…With full-backs, and anyone in a rear back four, I judge them massively on their ability to defend their zone and support the defence centrally. I would be astonished to learn of any juventino suggesting Chiellini is not monstrous on those scores. His passing is not brilliant, but his strength, tenacity, reading of the game and aerial ability make him normally a incredibly strong defender either at CB, LCB or LB. The LB role is different to LWB. With a wider forward line, there is less need for fullbacks to venture as far forward, other than to overlap and then supply. Not everyone judges defenders on their defensive abilities, hence why even De Ceglie has a few fans, when he is the worst defensive option I have ever seen at the club. I guess as a defender myself, I judge defensive positions hugely on defensive ability. My line-up was not influenced by current form. Chiellini has been off his game and Llorente hasn;t played..it was a case of looking at our strongest players at putting them in a formation together. It takes more than a few poor games for me to condemn Chiellini and lessen my impression of him as one of the world’s best.
I see Peluso as stronger in the tackle and more naturally a defender, than Asamoah. Which makes sense, given Asamoah is naturally a CM. Going forward against a Copenhagen side affording us huge space on the wings, is markedly different from foraging in the final third in Serie A or against an opponent who wants to own the flanks themselves. As a LB, in a flat back four, I would always choose Chiellini or Peluso. Partly because I consider them both stronger defensively, but also because Asamoah is wasted if deployed so deep. Peluso and Chiellini both seem stronger physically, much more obvious defenders. All depends on the system and the formation is never going to happen…
Still, I stick to my opinion that Chiellini is our strongest LB in a flat back four. Every time I have seen him play in such a role, I have been impressed with his incredible defensive blockade. Which is first and foremost how I judge defenders.",thegutterpoet ,"Sep 19, 2013 ", 4:23 PM,

Here’s the thing, assuming we play Vucinic/Giovinco as LW in the 433 then they are both more likely to cut inside more often than stretch the play by going out wide. Thus, like Somnath said, our problems with width on the left side would be in no better state than in our current 3-5-2.
That said with Licht/Isla is on the right, both players who like to get forward and put crosses in, then we could become a bit like Barcelona with Chiellini as a lateral CB a la Abidal. It could be interesting.

Just using a CB as a LB may give you more defensive solidity (which isn;t a problem for us in first place) but will still leave us terribly short staffed going forward.

So while we can maintain the high tempo pressing game over 90 minutes against lesser organized (tactically) opponents in the league, it has proved otherwise in the UCL where we really struggled till the end to qualify our group and then Bayern took us to the cleaners. Reasons were simple enough to see: Bayern had 2 excellent wingers supported by good wing-backs. Once Juve’s wide men were dispossessed while pressing forward, Bayern was quick enough to pass the ball to ‘Robbery’ and our 3 CBs were outnumbered as one of them was drawn out to go after the Bayern winger.
In case you would like another point of reference for this argument take a look at this: Your text to link here

A more flexible 3-5-2 with a winger dropping back deep could work the same but it all depends on how well the tactical plan is implemented, if the tactics set out by Conte aren’t followed to the tooth or players let us by making mistakes then they’re worth jack. A formation change can help but it doesn’t guarantee success I think that major qualms Conte has are that he wants to have his best players on the pitch and will modify the formation that suits them. I think Juve need more tactical flexibility but Conte thinks that we lack some of the key players for a 4-3-3 and I agree with him to some extent.
What bothered me was that saying the the 3-5-2 doesn’t cut it in Europe when we played and drew with Copenhagen… I saw this mostly on other places and responded here accordingly.

’twas a decent preview, Danny. I enjoyed and appreciated it.
 Like you, I feel that Conte’s desire and determination to win every game – lets call it his winning mentality, although we all know its a little more monstrous than that, and rightly so -has been as responsible as anything for the wonderful success of the last two seasons. For me, he is our most important signing of the post calciopoli era. Also he learns his lessons…Lazio were a team who gave us trouble last season, dumping us out of the coppa in the process and what has happened when we have met them twice already this season? We have stomped them. Had Lazio weakened that much?Had we strengthened that muchOr had Conte analyzed our encounters last term and worked damn hard to isolate and drill our troops to exploit their weaknesses?
I see this game as something similar. Although our opponents are (thankfully) different in name, there are, as you noted, certain parallels to last season’s depressing entrance back into the hall of the premier competition of all the top teams. Whereas the likes of Munich and Dortmund and Barca are proven outfits of quality, Conte’s side, OUR side, last season, were a work in progress. And we remain so…However, Conte is dynamic, he adjusts, he learns and reacts, and as wonderful as his man management abilities are, he is equally adept at learning from his mistakes.
I take his idea of ‘the moment is right’ to mean a home game against Verona, not a champions league opener against a team from a country where last season we were disappointing, maybe over-awed by the occasion, maybe complacent, maybe too tentative. That result, alongside other results of other group adversaries trying their luck in the same position, put us in need of the magnificent efforts we went on to achieve. I highly doubt Conte will be seeing this fixture as a chance to rotate. The team is set, other than Mirko…
Did we push him too far by playing him at the weekend against a very spirited and well organized Inter outfit??With the team set, other than loose whispers of Barzagli’s fitness, which could lead to the inclusion of Ogbonna, or even Lichsteiner as one of the back three, and Isla taking up his role on the right…what are our options if Vucinic needs a break? Well…we have plenty. Personally, I would love to see Quagliarella, although Llorente would be an intriguing surprise.
Given the obvious potential pitfalls of facing Real Madrid at home and away and also visiting Turkey, this takes on the shape of a MUST WIN fixture. I am sure Conte sees it the same way.

Champions League Preview: Juventus vs. FC Copenhagen — It all begins again,Danny Penza,"Sep 16, 2013, 7:00pm PDT",,"Quagliarella has proven he can perform in Champions League play and I would also love to see him alongside Tevez.
Our next three Serie A matches are Hellas (Sun), then @ Chievo (Wed), then @Torino (Sun). Whenever Conte has addressed Llorente’s progress, he has always mentioned the importance of him needing to adjust to Serie A defending and the importance of learning the system, more than he has about match fitness. Conte also said Llorente needs to regain some intensity and aggressiveness as well, and that can really only happen in meaningful game situations.
If Llorente making a transition to Serie A is indeed the primary concern, then allowing him to either feature against a Danish side or a newly promoted side (Hellas) at home might be the ideal time to put him in the XI – provided Conte is confident and comfortable with his understanding and ability to execute. I think it’s all about the learning curve and we’re close to seeing El Rey Leon and I’m excited about that.
Lastly, Beppe on El Rey Leon: “There is no Llorente problem. Don’t forget that he didn’t play that regularly last season. When we sign a player and hand him a four-year contract, we’re evidently not looking for immediate results in the space of one or two months. We believe in him and it is too early to judge.”",Tre Stelline ,"Sep 17, 2013 ", 8:02 AM,

- Chiellini didn’t only mess up on their goal but was also turned rather easily by Palacio on a number of occasions.

As for Llorente I understand that Conte rarely gives players who are new loads minutes for a lot of reasons; however, we looked tired and a bit out of sorts and this is exactly the kind of situation I imagined we would be using Llorente for. He is very good a holding the ball up and allowing the team to breathe while maintain possession high up on the pitch which is something we really could have used in the second half.

Here, he needs to defend, he needs to help build up play, he needs to make off the ball runs to allow Vidal and Marchisio and Pogba to dart behind him and slice the defense. More than anything, this is what Llorente is working on. There is every chance that when he plays, he’ll score a hattrick, but there’s also a chance that he’ll do an Amauri. Conte is trying to protect him by increasing the probability of the first happening, reducing the second.
Instead of being happy that we have several alternatives up front even when Llorente can’t play, we scream and demand that he plays even when the head coach who won back to back scudetti in his first try doesn’t think he’s ready yet. I know, just because he won doesn’t mean we can’t question his logic. The thing is, his logic actually make sense this time around, and still people ignore it.

- …who did really well connecting with Tevez in the few minutes he got to play. Anyone who frequents this side knows that I’m not a big fan of him, but I do think Tevez and Quags will connect better than Gio.
- Most of us seems to rate Isla’s performance from that single miss. Admittedly, it was an embarrassing miss, but he played well otherwise. Another option is good to have, and Isla offers competition for Licht, which is always a good thing. Like it or not, Isla is our player, and he should receive our support when he wears bianconeri

While those 2 are very good defenders and held up well, it did limit our offensive play on that side meaning we had to rely on Asamoah to provide the attacking impetus on the wings, which is not really a good thing….or maybe it is, I mean he did make an assist eventually.

Juventus 1 - Inter Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 14, 2013, 11:50am PDT",,"I think it was a combination of things…
First, I do agree that our offensive production on the right was very limited while Lichsteiner was on, don’t remember much of him during the match honestly, except for his yellow card. Not his usual locomotive self. Isla did provide more stability when he came on, good defensive cover with more drive going forward. All the people saying he doesn’t deserve to get more playing time or is an average player not worth the money spent to purchase him are exaggerating because of a wasted opportunity, a huge one at that though. Regardless, he needs more time to get into the groove, remember when Juve purchased him along with Asa, Isla was seen as the superior player. Besides Licht can’t play every single match.
Another point is that Pirlo was slowing down the game us, but not necessarily a bad thing if we maintain possession; however, he kept turning the ball over when getting caught in possession, very cheaply might I add, not allowing himself to dictate the tempo. His play was backfiring in a sense. A part of that is probably due to fatigue… International break, playing almost every club match, Conte’s training sessions… They all add up, and for a person his age its very hard on his body and mind.
Asamoah is not that bad going forward honestly. Had a pretty good game, could have been better. Did provide good defensive coverage and fluid transition from defense to attack. I also noticed that today he cut inside more often than his usual fake right go.left and run past defender or play the ball back to holding mid. Hopefully he can work more on that inssidd cut to his right and add a depletion dimension to his game.
When Marchisio returns and is match fit, I hope Conte rotates more often and plays Pogba in a deeper role and Marchisio back in his LCM position. This will allow all three CM to swap positions fluidly during the match as all are more wellrounded than Pirlo, who while has exceptional vision and range of passing which the other lack to his degree, he has no defensive ability and lacks pace and drive to go forward. This would.make it harder for players to close down the mid and our supply line. Pogba has already proven that he is difficult to mark, and with all three miss being extremely mobile its not easy to block off. Marchisio and Vidal love to make those late runs into the box, if you try to mark them too closely, that leaves Pogba more open. If you try to mark Pogba, Marchisio or Vidal can drop deeper into his position while Pogba swaps to a more advance position, throwing players off. In other words, at his age, Pirlo can only play in the regista role, while our other world.class miss are flexible. More dynamic this way.
Vucinic was clearly not 100% fit.
I don’t really blame Conte for picking Quags over Llorente. I would have loved for El Rey Leon to come on and get aome real minutes, but with the way the team was playing as a whole, I’m not sure if he would have been more productive. Yet, his added physicality would have been welcome Both he and Quags need to see more minutes to get into the groove.",Nuncio#7 ,"Sep 14, 2013 ", 10:42 PM,

I’m a bit torn on Pirlo’s performance. Initially, I thought he was taking too long but as JD pointed out there were times when the movement in front of him was, perhaps, unsatisfactory? I can’t remember who said it but it could be Pirlo who is benched when Marchisio returns to full fitness, not a snub by Conte but more of a “you need to rest, because you’re fatigued” type of gesture.
The international break was most definitely a factor, as you said, which has been underestimated a little by the fans. We could not press like we’ve done before.

Juve approaching the game thinking they’re going to face Inter, yes it’s right… but it’s Mazzari’s (Provincial Club with high wage physical players), so it’s more like Napoli than Inter.
2. The key players just been raped in these two weeks, we we should’ve expected a drop of form.
3. Pirlo is still THE architect, and he will be until the last game we play this season except he’s injured (God forbid) or in need of a rest. guy did lose some of his accuracy last night, but credit where it’s due… Juve’s goal started from his play.
4. Vidal is a real fucking soldier, guy feels no pain! Aaand an angry Vucinic is hard to argue.
5. Almost everyone thought that playing an unfit Vucinic, which is kind of slow even when he’s fit, is a wrong decision, but let us think again, who knows how this defaced Inters going to play their game? And what’s the best thing to do to benchmark the oppositions strength and weaknesses other than deploying the best team? If Juve win… fine, if Juve don’t… they’ll know what to expect from them next time they meet, and I think Juve will rape this Merda at home just like they rape Napoli at home two years ago.
6. The season is just started, there are still 35 games to play, no need to panic.
7. Professionalism is one of Llorente’s traits, it’s good to have professional athletes who doesn’t complain where they’re not played, but if I can meet the guy I’ll tell him to sweat blood in training, coz from what I see… he’s doesn’t do better to please our bloodthirsty coach!

Juventus 1 - Inter Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 14, 2013, 11:50am PDT",,"A few quick observations:
-Carlitos is an absolute animal. I was banging the table for him to come to Juve and he has actually exceeded my expectations in every way possible. His effort and work off the ball is sensational. He and Vidal make those around him that much better.
-If Isla was just one step quicker, that gorgeous back pass by Vucinic just after the half was an assist waiting to happen. Bad form to say Licht would’ve been there, but damn Mauricio. Like he just stopped running. Won’t even comment on his miserable effort later in the match that could’ve won it..
-Isla and Vidal had some nice repoire but Vucinic was caught offsides, it’s one thing if he sprints and mistimes the run, but offsides on a drift? That in unacceptable and it happens way too much, it is a lack of concentration.
-Q linked up beautifully with Tevez on the charge immediately following Vidal’s goal, when Carlitos’ shot just went wide. I think Q and Carlitos is a decent pairing. Give it time. I actually wanted Q to start this one.
-Pirlo had a few lovely ‘magnet-ball-to metal-boot’ type of passes in the 1st half, but he seems to be losing more challenges than I ever recall seeing in the past, I think he had his pocket picked three separate occasions.",Tre Stelline ,"Sep 15, 2013 ", 10:23 AM,
Juventus 1 - Inter Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 14, 2013, 11:50am PDT",,"I didn’t think Pirlo was that bad honestly.
Great interceptions, saw him heading a ball, had some lovely passes and certainly in the first 30 minutes he was our architect.
Those turnovers made him look bad though.
On Tevez; in the first 10 minutes he already intercepted 3 balls…what a player.",Awarshy#8 ,"Sep 15, 2013 ", 11:48 AM,
Juventus 1 - Inter Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 14, 2013, 11:50am PDT",,"Pirlo wasn’t ‘bad’ per se but he’s not threading as many balls with the pinpoint precision as we’ve been accustomed to – part of the equation is he doesn’t drop careless balls in blind, so without a viable opportunity he passes back to an outlet. I’m OK with that. But what was noticeable was the fact that he’s been on the wrong end of challenges in the middle third more frequently. He’s our regista and we need him to conduct the offense the way he’s proven he can, I have total confidence in him, and I haven’t seen anything that would lead me to believe otherwise.
Regarding Tevez, in the two friendlies Man City played in the US back in late May – one in St Louis, the other in NYC – Carlitos clocked over 5k in the first half of the first match. I have never seen someone hustle and play with purpose in a match one week after the Premiership season ended. Showcasing his ability to potential suitors? Perhaps. But he put on a work rate clinic in a meaningless match and it was impressive to say the least. (Shortly after that I remember I wrote a post about how Higuain is a terrific player but the striker we need is Tevez.)
Anyway I’ve always admired his play, but that effort alone told me this is the guy we need. Nothing but grinta from him. Massive respect for the man from Fuerte Apache.",Tre Stelline ,"Sep 15, 2013 ", 2:16 PM,
Juventus 1 - Inter Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Sep 14, 2013, 11:50am PDT",,"Well, give credit when it’s due. Playing against Mazzarri’s 3-5-2, there’s less space to exploit, and Inter is not Lazio with their makeshift CB pairing. Pirlo didn’t have much option to pass to, and Palacio/Alvarez, assisted by Taider/Guarin kept pressuring him whenever there’s a chance.
That said, I do think that Pirlo’s form has been somewhat less stellar now. Actually, last season he wasn’t as superb as he was in his first season with us, too. You could say that’s down to age, or maybe that’s simply because he had an outstanding first season, or maybe because he was fatigued with the Euro and Confederations Cup in 2 summers in a row. What I’m saying is that it’s pretty much obvious he hasn’t been his best for a while now.
