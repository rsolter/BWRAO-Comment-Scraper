To portray depth in an image the things in the foreground are larger than those in the background. Hence why Tevez and Morata on the near side of the field appear larger than players on the far side.

He was outstanding vs Milan and that was consistent with an arc of play that’s been improving week by week. He’s
been looking like the Evra of five years ago. He and Pogba are communicating on a high level. His speed and defense have
also improved greatly. I’m starting to think(hope?) we may have stumbled upon another Barzagli situation where, with
small expectations we brought in an aging once-elite back, for depth, and he surprised everyone by becoming reJuvenated and a
vital piece of our puzzle. In his current form, Evra’s making our transition to back four comfortable.",Ricardo 1 ,"Feb 8, 2015 ", 6:57 AM,

tone it down a notch to ""good"" and i’d agree
His speed … also improved greatly
i’m more of the opinion that he’s hitting that peak form in a season these days, where his body is optimally acclimatized to the environment while not hitting fatigue point yet. if you imply speed improvement as in ""regaining that one or two steps of pace against age progression"", boy, that’d be awesome but i think that’s improbable.
… and defense have also improved greatly
i never think there’s anything deficient in Evra’s defensive capabilities, provided that he’s positioned himself well, i.e. behind the ball or closing down the opposition. his issues are failure to track back and being caught out of position, and those do still crop up in his game sometimes (and will never be totally gone, in my opinion)
i am satisfied with his current form, and hope that he can maintain it consistently, but his is not quite like Barzagli situation yet. still, Marotta can mark this as ""mission accomplished"" in providing the team with a proper LB for a four-man backline to work",hant00 ,"Feb 8, 2015 ", 7:50 AM,

But to answer your question more directly, yes, I would trust someone like him over Evra who will be 34 by next season. He’s grown into his role nicely and his last few performance have been good, but I just fear that his age is going to catch up with him soon.

He wanted me to meet another friend of his who he introduced as ‘another psycho Italian soccer fan.’ I got excited. Someone I could talk to about calcio instead of watching college basketball highlights and commenting about the Knicks loss?! Could it be?!
Instantly, I find out this other calcio fan was an interista. I apologize to him, tell him I feel sorry, and start making jokes about Moratti and Osvaldo. To which he responds with something along the lines of ‘whatever, perhaps you could try to win something without cheating for once.’ I didn’t want to actually argue A) with an interista (they have a tough enough time as is) and B) at a crowded bar on a Saturday night – so, I simply pointed out two things: 1) it must be really impressive for Juve (truly, a feat) to ‘cheat’ for at least 32 season and have no one else come close to catching them, but for one obvious incident; and 2) you cannot tell me to try to win at least once ‘without cheating’ when your president was caught doing the same things for which Juve was punished but could not be punished himself bc of a silly statute of limitations.

Juventus 3-1 Milan: Bianconeri register dominant win in derby,Tudor Tamas,"Feb 8, 2015, 1:03am PST",,"I think it is too early to say. First of all, Italian teams never take qualifiers seriously, so there is that. I totally agree that Conte values experience over youth but I think he has a point with it. There is no benefit to playing youth who hasn’t been playing a lot of minutes in difficult matches. For example, remember the first time Bonucci played a the San Paolo under Conte and he looked totally distraught by the atmosphere and the weight of the match? We don’t see that anymore because of his experience.
I can easily see Verratti getting some serious minutes under Conte because he is an ""experienced"" younger player, however, I am sure Pirlo would be choice number 1. Gabbiadini seems well on his way to getting meaningful minutes but I don’t think he is a player Conte rates very highly (he could have brought him to Turin for years but never pulled the trigger). Berardi and Zaza are a big question mark. If they come to Juve this summer and play a meaningful role in Serie A and Champions League, I am sure they’ll be considered. If they get minutes like Morata and Coman have been getting to date, I doubt Conte will give them much time (Morata’s case seems to be changing). With that being said, it will be hard to give room to Morata, Coman, Berardi, Zaza, and Tevez next season.
Unfortunately for Conte, the National team is a reflection of the league, and the league at the moment prefers experience over youth (likely due to the rigorous tactics of Serie A).",JRob ,"Feb 9, 2015 ", 10:05 AM,
Juventus 3-1 Milan: Bianconeri register dominant win in derby,Tudor Tamas,"Feb 8, 2015, 1:03am PST",,"I’m not against playing experienced players over youth, but there is a balance, and Conte hasn’t shown enough that he is going to balance that right amount of youthful exuberance and veteran experience.
I do think it’s too early to make a solid judgement, but from what I’ve seen so far of Conte as Italy manager, coupled with his tendencies as Juve boss, he is not one to stray away from his formula, for better or for worse.
That is what worries me most. He insists upon his 3-5-2. Ok, you like a formation? That’s fine, but the way you utilize is not efficient and doesn’t provide a lot of creativity or attacking impetus. He has his mind set on deploying a regista and 5 defenders. The wingbacks don’t offer a lot going forward, aside from Darmian. Holland used a 3-5-2 to great affect in the World Cup, but utilized attacking minded wingers who could pin defenders in their own half.
My gripe with Conte is his refusal to change things up after they have gone stale. I don’t understand this, as his early tenure at Juve saw him change his plans from a 4-2-4 to a 4-3-3 to a 3-5-2. Why is his heart so set on an imperfect system now? It’s not that a 3-5-2 shouldn’t be used, but he needs to establish a more attacking minded 3-5-2. He also needs to step back a little and let players get a little more creative freedom.
If he does continue with the 3-5-2, I think he should at least try to go with a 3-4-1-2 as opposed to a 3-1-4-2. An advanced playmaker may make it much easier to create space in the final third and reduce the opportunity for strikers to get isolated from one another. The two DM would create a strong shield in front of the defense and provide more stability as the wingbacks get forward. Marchisio and De Rossi would be a great tandem, as well as Veratti who is the more creative player and also solid defensively. This would allow conte to deploy more attacking minded WBs. My choices would be Darmian and Candreva.
Conte keeps using De Sciglio, a natural FB, as a wingback, and it never works. I think his injuries, could with constantly ayibg out of position for club and country has caused him to regress. He also deploys two out and out strikers, who share similar characteristics. Zaza and Immobile are very similar, albeit the latter possesses more technical ability, higher work rate, and better link up play. That’s fine if you put a playmaker in behind them. Either use a seconds punta next to an out and out striker when Pirlo is on, or don’t use a regista and throw on a trequartista with your two #9s.",Nuncio#7 ,"Feb 9, 2015 ", 11:39 AM,

typo? or you really believe this?
As for the rest. Conte favours defense over anything else. That is why Juventus finished all three seasons under him with one of the fewest goals against in all of Europe. Although I didn’t watch the teams he coached before Juve, it was my understanding that his teams were very attacking minded. The last year at Juve and now with the national team, he seems to be more defensively minded.
In terms of flexibility, I think the reason why he doesn’t change is because he wants the best players out there. Sure he can play 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 but in HIS opinion that puts weaker players out on the field (weaker mentally, tactically or in terms of discipline). Sure, Zaza, Berardi, and Sansone sound exciting up front, but will they have the discipline to carry us all the way. He rather have Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini at the back because they will help push the team when things get tough.
Now, that is his view. I for one would favour a change in formation that allows some new players and some old players. I rather see Italy get eliminated in the quarters with a team that helped Berardi, Zaza, Verratti and Rugani develop, than see Italy go one more round (semis) with a team full of older players who won’t contribute to the team in 2018. Mr. Conte will rather get as far as possible. He will use this as another step to become one of the great managers of Europe for the next decade.",JRob ,"Feb 9, 2015 ", 12:49 PM,

Is his style truly defensive, or is it more of a ""safe"" approach to games? He often had his Juve playing possession football, and this has largely translated into the national team; however, he seems to have hit the same problem, scoring. The creativity and finishing in the final third leaves a lot to be desired, and I think that’s what is going to hinder this Italy team the most. If you can’t score, you can’t win. In the matches where we cede possession, he doesn’t set his team up to move the ball out from the back effectively and quickly to initiate a counterattack, instead were just soaking up pressure, get the ball back, and build up play very slowly once more. To me it seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy, play safe avoid conceding, but then we play too safely, end up getting hemmed in, make a mistake, then concede anyways (usually from giving a set piece away), followed by scrambling to score, only to run out of time.
I’m not saying go gung-ho, balls out a la Zeman, but it would be nice to see the Azzuri play with some bravado. We’ve seen them do it under Prandelli in the Euros and Confederations cup. Some of our best games came against Spain, England, Germany, and Brazil.

I have thought of a 4-2-3-1 with Morata-Coman-Berardi behing one of Tevez or Zaza up-front but it doesn’t seem to suit the best abilities of these players. Moreover, will Zaza get some serious playing time if he is fighting for a starting spot with Tevez?… doubtful.
Rumors so far put Zaza closer to Juve than Berardi. I kept hearing that Juve want Zaza on the team but I don’t hear about Juve pushing for Berardi to join. Maybe this is because at the moment Berardi will find little playing time in the current formation, I don’t know.
And then I thought to myself. maybe the management will do with Berardi the same thing they did with Zaza last year. Buy Zaza for 15m this summer. Sell Berardi’s half to Sassuolo for 15m with a buyback clause of 30m the following year. This will reduce expenses this year while letting Berardi ""grow"" for another year. I hope this is not the case because I see Berardi as a more necessary player for Juve than Zaza. As a matter of fact, I rather leave Zaza for another season with Sassuolo and bring Berardi than the other way around.

Whether they get adequate playing time will be up to Allegri in terms of tactics and rotation. If Llorente leaves (which seems to be more likely according to reports in Italy) then Zaza is a direct replacement. The forwards is one area we’ve been fortunate with regards to injuries this year (Morata’s early setback aside) and that seems about the right number and combination of players through a season. The big question mark is if we’re forced to sell Pogba – reports suggest that if that’s the case then we will try to sign Cavani or Falcao. That would mean it would be better to leave Zaza at Sassuolo, but he looks like he’s ready for a move to a big side now rather than spend another year there, even though we can buy him for €18m in summer 2016.
I read recently (think it was Mina Rzouki, but not sure, so not 100% about accuracy) that Allegri told the management that his long-term favoured formation was 433. If that’s the case then both Berardi and Zaza should be great signings for him and I see no reason why Pereyra would not be an effective wide player on either side of a 433. If the Mkhitaryan move goes through then I’ve got no idea how everyone fits, unless it’s a move towards a 4231 with no Pirlo, but I’m not sure whether that would be good for Tevez.

Berardi, on the other hand – I’m not so sure he’s coming just yet.
I saw Shaqiri yesterday vs Palermo and he played trequartista – to his credit, he actually played well. It got me thinking how much more potent Juve’s attack would be with a proper playmaker. I have to believe Max and Beppe will make finding a creative mid is priority no. 1 such as Mkhitaryan.
So operating under the presumption Juve adds a quality 3/4 for the low/mid 20’s and Zaza in full for 15m, adding Berardi may not happen for one more season, when he could be the de facto replacement for Carlitos.",Tre Stelline ,"Feb 9, 2015 ", 12:07 PM,

I feel there were lack of rumours coz when we tried to get him in summer (one of the first things we did in summer) he said he wanted to spend another season at sassuolo as he promised them that so we left him there, if we would have gone for him and ask him to come now in winter IMO that would hv seem lack of respect to him and his wishes.
If we wanted to get him last summer for conte’s 352 in the coming window I dont see why we wont go for him considering Allegri has tried a couple of variations of 4 man back line even tried 433 in coppa so he will find a place to fit berardi

Juventus 3-1 Milan: Bianconeri register dominant win in derby,Tudor Tamas,"Feb 8, 2015, 1:03am PST",,"Exactly my thoughts. If Berardi stays one more year at Sassuolo his growth will stunt. After this year he would have gotten everything that the club has to offer. He is the leader of the leaders of the team, the pressure rests on his shoulders when he takes PKs, he is responsible for the team’s attack (not solely responsible of course).
At Juve he will get to play with other stars, and learn from them. I also believe his poor disciplinary record will improve. When Bonucci, Pirlo, or Buffon tell you to shut up and walk away you listen. He also won’t be expected to carry the team. He will play with more freedom. Also, at Sassuolo he has been heavily marked this year. At Juve that will not be as likely. Some teams already double team on Pirlo and lately they are trying to double team on Pogba. It would be hard to double team on all our players.",JRob ,"Feb 10, 2015 ", 12:55 AM,

I dont think tevez shd hv problem playing in Allegri’s TQ position as we hv seen time and again he has the total freedom to move ard the final third and he likes that. This is also why I believe berardi can suit in the 4321 as we hv seen with pereyra/tevez they move wide to wings/cut in/drop deep/switch sides all these things I hv seen berardi do in sassuolo.
(note in a rigid/sole TQ i dont know whether berardi can play/be effective as I hv not seen him done but in a 4321 as one of the 2 with support of tevez and freedom to move in final third he shd be fine + if u see avg position in games of sassuolo many times berardi is in a slighty lower compare to zaza and sansone and tucked in a bit on the right)
in a 433 i dont think tevez will agree to play out wide, yes i know he played there against RM but that was one of game he always has said he prefers to play in center where he is closer to goal then out wide which is hwy believe with the freedom Allegri grants tevez he can fit in a 4231 as a TQ.
+ As I hv said before with the way morata is playing he can easily partner up with another TM upfront as he has good link up play, good burst/pace so he can play well with another TM especially if we hv a TQ
Ofc at the end of the day, its Allegri’s job to make players understand their role and play it to their strengths if he can make them happy and can get best out of them that will be great.",SJ_JUVE ,"Feb 9, 2015 ", 8:01 PM,

Juventus 3 - AC Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Feb 7, 2015, 3:00pm PST","What a great game, for many reasons","- The game was very unlike an Italian game and Juventus played very unlike Juventus: Fast build-up play when necessary, but not too much; just the right amount. Fast counter-attacks, very open play.
- Morata is the guy we needed all along, and his inclusion makes counter-attacks readily possible, and most importantly, easier for Tevez. Morata is coming along very nicely, just when the doctor ordered, which makes it all a bit more special. He ran his heart out there tonight, defended when needed, pressed those defenders all night. I voted him MOTM for his actions [I see a lot of the members also voted Morata for MOTM, which means he did deserve it, and also that a lot of people on this blog are broadcasting on the same wave]
- Vidal is starting to look like his old ball-winning self again, throwing yet another commanding performance. He’s not quite at his top form yet, but you can see he shook off the mental issues he’s been dealing with since the knee injury. Vidal is liable to dish out a MOTM against Dortmund, you heard it here first.
- Marchisio being an absolute dynamo in midfield, Evra sitting on Cerci’s ass all night, even getting to nice positions there on the left, and Padoin, the way I see it, with another soid performance at a random position dethrones Pepe as our official ""Jack of all trades"" utility man.

Morata being on is night and day difference.

Evra did a reasonable job on Cerci. Still, deserved a yellow, Pogba had to baby sit him once and Morata run all the way back to cover his left flank when both he and Evra were in the Milan box.
Padoin was quite good for Padoin.
Why can’t we defend set pieces?!
Buffon is amazing.
Tevez did good Tevez things but this game shows his weaknesses. He’s average on the counter. So many times it breaks down with him as he makes poor passes and decisions.
We really need better passing in the final third. Could have score 5 or 6.
Glad Max played Xmas tree.
Don’t understand why he wouldn’t make subs around 70mins up 3-1.

Juventus 3 - AC Milan 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Feb 7, 2015, 3:00pm PST",Thoughts (AKA Not Monster Long Summary),"1) Marchisio MoTM. He was an absolute monster. First to every ball, the coolest head in midfield keeping the ball ticking. His runs and passing were superb. Shots were brilliant and he was really unlucky not to score today. I also feel like Honda being kept quiet for the most part is down to him. Unsung hero of this team. He’s been leading from the front on the pitch this year.
2) Morata a close second. Today shows what having a fluid target man can do. I only feel like he can be more selfish. He drifts wide and causes sheer pandemonium in the defense because of his speed and running. He can dribble with the ball well, has a good touch, is not afraid to use his body and he seems uber aware of where everyone is. He did all the dirty work for Tevez in a way Llorente never could today. He showed major grinta too. That defensive run was the highlight. So happy that he scored, and his celebration was telling. Lot of love for him after yesterday’s interview too. We have a real gem on our hands.
3) Vidal was closer to his usual combative self. I felt the referee gave Milan too many easy fouls as a result of his hustle. Still, his offensive contributions were a little lacking.. He’s wasted at AM. Nevertheless, he needed a game like this. I thought both Pirlo and Pogba had merely acceptable games. Pirlo deserves special credit for his defensive play and set-pieces today, but passing was unusually sloppy. Pogba just had a frustrating game and it showed. That he still had some badass moves is testament to his genius.
4) Very solid games from Evra and Padoin. Did exactly what was asked of them. Good performances. I thought Leo had a fairly solid game too. Chiellini was the stand-out to me.. Again… VERY welcome return to form. We’ve missed his sheer rock like presence at the back. Its only the slight complacency at the back and set-pieces we need to work on.
5) Buffon was and is Buffon. What higher adjective is there? Captain Gigi on one side vs Captain Muntari on the other… LOL.
6) I actually thought Tevez didn’t have the best game. He had a good first half. I thought he looked a little off the pace in the second. I counted atleast 4 very promising counter opportunities that he blundered.. Still, his warrior like drive ahead is irreplaceable. Let him get much needed rest against Cesena. 14 and counting.
7) As someone pointed out, very different Juve performance. VERY VERY fluid going ahead, the attack and midfield. Mid looked a little shaky under pressure at the back, and while the defense was solid, we seemed to be playing slightly risky. Still, 3 good goals, could have been more. +10 for now.

He fought like hell in this game and really sweat for the shirt but I feel like he was the weak link in the middle because Milan’s pressing really affected him. Sometimes his reaction to the pressing and Honda’s marking was playing the ball backwards and putting the defense in difficult situations. Also he customarily slows down the play when he has the ball, and that helped Milan’s pressing. In the end Juve’s class and effort overcame Milan, but the problems created by Milan’s pressing especially in the first half (they could not sustain the pressing), worries me with Dortmund coming up. Their pressing can be maniacal, and if they are smart they will harass and press Pirlo and Chiellini.

I believe Tevez, Pirlo and Evra will leave at the same time next year 30 June. Between now and then it is time to get replacements. The preferred is either Darmian or Rodruiguez for Evra (why not both?). For pirlo i think it should be verratti but he may be to expensive.
Tevez will be interesting. Morata is there but Zaza could be on his way. But do we expect them to reach that level? Time will tell. The issue I have with 4312 is you need 2 world class strikers not just Tevez. If tevez leaves we will be out of WC strikers. This is why i would prefer 433. Coman to me has shown a lot in skill/quality in his short game time. So, for RW its either Berardi or Reus, Rues/Berardi will be affordable to place on the wings.
A good thing a about Reus is he will add that extra speed and creativity we need while filling the RW position.
But, if I wanted to sound crazy, the perfect replacement for Tevez would be Aguero. Yes, we won’t spend that much in the near future but i love the guy in the PL!Also, concerning players with huge wage demands, those 3 above leaving next year would leave an extra 10m+ a year for wages.

Costa was 30m maybe, Cuadrado was 30m, Modric about that … those types of players (not literally those three, but players of that quality) would really increase the quality of this squad. Assuming the unlikely – that the board would allocate the entire 100m to transfers in – Juve might not be able to buy a future ballon d’or, a world champion, and an all-time center back (like w Zizou’s sale), but even in this inflated market, we could do damage picking up top drawer talent.",dweb ,"Feb 7, 2015 ", 7:42 AM,

Can we convince a player of our project over that of one of Man City, Man United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Barca, PSG, Bayern, Real Madrid (all ahead of us in the Deloitte Money League)? Possibly, but if two of these big clubs go for the same player then we will be in trouble.

Trapattoni ""L’avvocato said if you’re willing to do crazy things for certain players then it’s better to sell them.""
Trapattoni ""Pogba is great but he’s not Messi, he’s not non-transferable. For a 100m or so it is better to sell him.""
I agree with the first part that if you hv to go at crazy lengths just to keep a player then he shd be sold as it will disrupt the locker room and no one is bigger than the club.
On the 2nd part as I hv said before if he is worth 100 at 21 then by euro or WC when he is matured more he will be worth 150-200 sell him then, with our incoming youngsters in the next window barring LB we hv a very decent team.

Juventus vs. Milan Preview: Round 22 — il Diavolo is coming to town,Danny Penza,"Feb 6, 2015, 2:40pm PST",,"We are facing a Milan team that is missing a lot of key players.
De Jong is the most important piece of their midfield and us out injured, as is Montolivo. The absences of El Sharaawy (injury)and Destro (yellow card accumulation) blunts their attack. Abate and De Sciglio are both out with injuries, so their already weak FB positions are going to be a question mark for this match.
Inzaghi’s best bet is to play compact and solid defense and possibly catch us on the counter if our FBs push too high. Menez will certainly be the outlet, and we’ll most likely see Bonaventura and Honda drop much deeper than usual.
Seeing as inzaghi won’t play with a true #9, unless he starts Pazzini (unlikely), it would not make sense for Allegri to use a 3-5-2. Leaving 3 CBs to mark one player is a waste of attacking potential. Padoin and Evra can push up and really pin the opponent’s FBs in their half, thus forcing Menez to either drop deep or risk getting isolated up top.
If Tevez does not play, then our best bet is to go with Moratta and Llorente up top. Allegri is likely to go with Vidal at TQ and MPP in midfield. This could be a game where Pirlo’s brilliance can come in handy at unlocking Milan if they park the bus. Besides, a potential midfield if Poli, Essien, and Muntari does not worry me one bit. I wouldn’t be opposed to Pereyra starting in place of Pirlo, in behind the strikers and moving Vidal back and Claudio to regista. But, the shear talent, power, and solidity of MVPP is more than enough to destroy Milan’s midfield trio.
My only worry is that with Milan potentially crowding the box, the 4-3-1-2 may prove to be too narrow. For this reason, Morata and Llorente, in particular, have to be on their game come Saturday night. They may not get too many chances, and if Paletta gets the nod and is back to form, Llorente will have a competent defender stuck to him like glue. He needs to be strong and his touch needs to be true.

That’s where I meant he should play as well.. hence subbing with Marchisio…
As for Pirlo, for me personally he’s a different kind of animal. I’d always love to see him start games like this one. Even though Marchisio has proven many times to be a more than adequate replacement, Pirlo’s magic, certain touches and calm makes him irreplaceable.. But then that’s just me.
For me Pogba, Marchisio and Vidal, and now Sturaro as well, have to duke it out for the two positions flanking Pirlo. As it’s proven there are going to be times when Pirlo will have a bad game that will be a time to have all three of Pogba, vidal and marchisio in midfield together.
Even though Pereyra’s frantic finishing has left a lot to be desired. His trickery and off-and-with-the-ball runs that opens room for Tevez and his striking partner to manoeuvre into are far superior than Vidal. Although I am not sure why Allegri hasn’t experimented with Coman in that role.

But – I don’t like it one bit.
He had a nice breakthrough season at BVB but has been atrocious since the start of the current season with only 2 goals and not many offensive contributions – If you listen to BVB fans you’d get my point, as most of them blame him for Ramos and Immobile missfiring and not being serviced by Mkhitaryan as one would have thought he’d be able to, as BVB’s main playmaker behind, usually a lone striker. They think he is uninspired and ineffective, and gets lost for big parts of games.
So from where I’m sitting, it looks like even Mkhitaryan as CAM for us is going to be a gamble for Juventus, when you think of his transfer worth: Dortmund paid 27.5mil for him, and if we do end up getting him, Juve would look silly if we pay for him anything over 15mil.

I wouldn’t say that he is a bad player or a bad purchase, and if he is properly coached by Allegri, I think he will be a true revelation.
I have two issues with bringing Mkhitaryan:
1) If Allegri is NOT the coach in two years, we would have made a huge investment on a player who most likely would be sold unless there are other coaches playing with a trequartista.
2) How do we line up next year?

New stadiums attract different types of crowds. Just as run down neighborhoods and street attract thugs and hoodrats, dilapidated stadiums attract hooligans.
Club owned stadiums result in increased match-day revenue, which can also go towards hiring competent security to tame the crowd and make people feel safe. With a better security force, people will be less likely to chant racist remarks or conduct violent and stupid acts during a game.

He’s still outstanding, was getting back to form in January and he is a COMPLETELY different player to Verratti.
Eg Vidal was Juventus TOP SCORER throughout the Conte era. Verratti can’t do this. Vidal is a tenacious box to box presence. Verratti can’t do this.
I like Verratti and see him as a Pirlo replacement.
If we sell Vidal we need to replace him with a different type player IMO.
We’ve got other focuses in my opinion like LB and TQ/CAM before shuffling an outstanding midfield.
Maybe sell him 2016 but I wouldn’t do it this year.
It is going to be tricky though and we’ve gotta plan well because Pirlo is on the way out, pressure on Pogba to leave and there are these Vidal issues. And that was our entire first choice midfield last year.
We’ve gotta plan carefully.",Paolo C ,"Feb 5, 2015 ", 7:39 PM,

Whereas by selling other players you’ll either get un upgrade (eg Llorente for Zaza, Pereyra for Mkhitaryan) or funds for an unused player for one we might use (eg Asamoah for new LB).
I don’t think the same can be said of selling Vidal. Unlike the players above he’s one of the first names on the team sheet and has a set of skills that are almost irreplaceable.

As a straight up fullback, I don’t think there is a stronger or better player in this squad than Lichtsteiner. Caceres’s strengths are in his pace, his craftiness, and his tackling – Lichtsteiner is a much more responsible defender and isn’t as prone to getting burned or being caught out of position. The times when Juve is hit on a counter down the left flank and Lichtsteiner is positioned too far up the pitch to get back, it is because Max puts a high premium on his fullbacks/wingbacks getting very high up in attack and the CMFs cycling the ball out to them wide. In other words, his ‘mistakes’ are more a product of the system (I think) whereas Caceres earnestly gets caught out of position as a result of lapses of focus.
Both players have a place in this squad and their unique (and distinct!) abilities lend themselves well to Juve’s setup. But if we are discussing a disciplined and strong fullback, I think the discussion ends with Lichtsteiner.",dweb ,"Feb 6, 2015 ", 6:47 AM,

From your list, Darmian, Berardi and Rugani could join the team quickly (Reus is not coming). Darmian almost immediately (he has Serie A experience and will help fill a troublesome position). Rugani and Berardi would be used intermittently over the first half of the season. From those two I see Berardi becoming a permanent fixture while Rugani will get some minutes but not much. Our defense has allowed 9 goals in 21 matches, that is less than 1 goal every two matches. Incorporating those three young players into a squad like Juve would be a feat of its own.

I am unfamiliar with the show but saw some really weird/funny pics from it where Marchisio was dressed up as Skeletor and Cattelan was HeMan. No, seriously … check it out.
What’s more, Cattelan asked Claudio if he uses WhatsApp (the messaging App for those who live under some sort of rock) and Claudio responded that he’s actually in a group chat with Storari, Chiellini and Bonucci. Cattelan then requests that Claudio permits him to get involved in the messaging and broadcast it on his show. Pretty funny. There’s Storari goofing around and even a Chiello selfie!

Juventus to face Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia semifinals,Danny Penza,"Feb 3, 2015, 2:15pm PST",,"It is more that he seems to have that calm composed game reader mind the likes of Nesta and Rio Ferdinand had. He doesn’t head in for the swashbuckling challenge a-la Cannavaro or Chiellini. In the same manner that Buffon is amazing because his positioning is SO good, he doesn’t need to make extraordinary LOOKING saves often, Rugani’s positioning, reading of the game and tactical awareness seem highly evolved for a player SO young and with so little experience. That’s what all the hype is about. He isn’t the player who you’ll find in the highlights reel of a game. He’s more of a Barzagli. The solid wall, and in his absence, the team crumbles significantly. He’s successfully been able to marshal the Empoli defense and neutralize some of the best attacks in Serie A, in his first year in the league, at the age of 20. It also worth noting that I believe he hasn’t been booked at all this season. Unless I’m msitaken… A 20 year old who’s started 95% of all games for a relegation battling team.. That tells you all you need to know about his defensive ability.
Traits like intelligence and awareness are difficult to breed. Players like Nesta and Barzagli and Pirlo and Marchisio are born with it. They see moves before they happen. Other traits like physicality, strength, tackling etc. can be acquired, honed and improved over time. For a rough diamond that needs polishing, he looks like very little polish is required. There is a significant lack of defenders of this mould in the current game. They think that being fast and quick in the tackle is how you neutralize a Ronaldo or Messi, when a 36 year old Nesta was able to do it with ease because he has the mind to be able to keep Messi in his pocket, even when Messi had the overwhelming advantage physically. All our defenders, Giorgio, Leo and Caceres, with the only exceptions being Barzagli, and to a very small extent, Ogbonna, rely on their body to be good defenders. The best way to build a frighteningly mean defense? Pair one of them up with someone who has the brain, physical attributes and room for growth that Rugani seems to possess… Skies the limit..",Kaushik_10 ,"Feb 3, 2015 ", 11:44 PM,

I know when it was built for Italia ’90 it could hold nearly 70,000, those were the days when AC Milan averaged over 75,000 and both Roma and Lazio brought in 50,000 every Sunday, but even back then Juve averaged close to 40,000 so that was the thinking when they built Juventus Stadium – sell out as many matches as possible.

So that’s less than a million to permanently make him a Juve player this summer. There could be similar deals for Zaza and Berardi too. I remember Marotta seeing we were outdone by Roma for Iturbe because they could offer more liquid cash. At the same time we were able to pull off deals where we were able to sell the likes of Matri, Vuc and Quags for instant cash. So for example, if we’re able to sell Llorente for a healthy 15-20 million Euros in a one time transaction this summer, and we go for in the Champions League, we could easily break even while dealing for Zaza and Berardi (considering we pay installments for them too).

Juventus Deadline Day in Review: The fireworks were left somewhere else,Danny Penza,"Feb 3, 2015, 3:35am PST",Lets put it this way,"He is 19 n had 2 solid/great seasons in Seria A where many top players struggle, Berardi stats past two seasons are
2013/2014 Apps 26(3) Goals 16 Assists 6
2014/2015 Apps 17 Goals 6 Assists 6
This season he has grown more as he involves more of his teammates, he tracks back n hustles the opposing defenders (resulting YC n needs to work on that) he has good pace, can dribble well, good long balls/crosses, decent finishing, quite creative and he is very hard working. Basically he can be a great SS/no. 10 to build ur squad ard. He has the potential and the attitude for it.
Also important to remember for his 1st half was bought for half of marrone whose we bought back for 500k plus peluso (valued 2.8mil). Technically till now berardi cost us ~3mil. Usually as I hv seen when the lower clubs sell their half that is = near total value but on technicality if 15mil is 50% then 100% is 30mil. Besides looking at current trend where iturbe is 27mil+, likes of pereyra n ibarbo are 15mil then berardi is near 30mil.
Anyways I doubt marotta will fork out 30mil for both Zaza n berardi as he will def include top primaveras or other top youngster we recently bought in the deal.",SJ_JUVE ,"Feb 4, 2015 ", 3:21 AM,

Juventus Deadline Day in Review: The fireworks were left somewhere else,Danny Penza,"Feb 3, 2015, 3:35am PST",,"For me the only weaknesses are Marrone, De Ceglie, Padoin, Evra, Pirlo (in that order).
I know the Pirlo comment will be slightly controversial (especially with my man Cosmo) but despite his brilliance, I’m increasingly getting the feeling that he brings a level of vulnerability to our play in Max’s style (or lack of it).
Interesting that Conte seemed to be able to get so much more out of Pirlo. The lack of heavily programmed tactics may work against Pirlo under Max cos he doesn’t have people
making set runs off the ball and thus gets caught in possession or gives it away more often.
Maybe this is why Max couldn’t get something out of him at Milan in the end.",Paolo C ,"Feb 3, 2015 ", 9:01 PM,

The standard rule is no player can play for another European club in European competition in the same season.
But, apparently you are allowed 1 player who would otherwise be conflicted from playing for having represented another team in a European competition same season provided:
a. That other team did not use them in the same competition (ie can play if they switch from a UCL to Europa League team and vice versa but not if they already played in ); and
The two teams are not now playing in the same competition (ie the two clubs are not now in the Europa League by virtue of one or both of them having dropped there from the CL).
So for instance we could have signed one player who played in the Europa like Kramaric and used him in CL.

Juventus Deadline Day in Review: The fireworks were left somewhere else,Danny Penza,"Feb 3, 2015, 3:35am PST",Off-Topic - Juventus Provisional Finance Update,"Juventus will publish their half-yearly accounts end of February this year. This site seems to get the provisional figures right.
Some highlights from the blog which is in Italian. All values are in euros:-
Revenue has increased by 9 million from December taking this season’s revenue north of the 300 million mark. Last season revenue stood at 315 million.
Revenue increase above was mainly from the calciomercato (8 million) with profit from sales on Gabbiadini (1.5), Masi (0.8) and other youngsters (5.4)
Gross Operating Profit increased by 7.8 million from December. Our balance for this season is now -40 million compared to end of last year’s balance of -6.6 million. The season is far from finished so this should improve.
Our Financial Fair Play has improved considerably. Juve has now fulfilled all the 4 criteria required for FFP – in december one criteria was not yet met. Also, our FFP on last 3 years now stands at -5.3 million where UEFA allows -30 million.
All in all a magnificent job by management and also why I (one of the few) rated Juve’s mercato at A-. Now it’s up to the coach and players to bring in the cash for next season winning in Serie A, Coppa Italia and CL:-
Champions League – estimates for qualification, in euros, are
Round of 16 = 8.6 million
Quarters = 9.1 million
Semis = 9.9 million
Winner = 4 million
for a total of 31.6 million euros still available to win in CL – sometimes dreams come true!
The Coppa Italia final is worth 2.3 million which will double to 5.6 million if Juve win. First we have to beat Fiorentina.",Fefu ,"Feb 4, 2015 ", 1:58 AM,

Juventus Deadline Day in Review: The fireworks were left somewhere else,Danny Penza,"Feb 3, 2015, 3:35am PST",Thx,"Also a thing I wanted to point out they way inter are spending since they are breach of FFP they can be fined and the money they made in EL (ard 7mil) might not be given to them.
If we were to spend like inter and given the same fine (we stand to make ard 25 i think) that will be a huge hit for us financially or if given the fine like man city’s (€65.4m conditional fine, wage cap, transfer spend restriction and limit naming 21-man European squad from the usual 25)
Since we r quite independent of the owners we cant risk this type of fines, so I m very happy with financial status of the club. We are on similar system as chelsea has (since FFP started) of mass youth player purchase then loaned out and gaining profit when they are sold. This is great as we can get top talents at cheap price (Rugani, Zaza n berardi) or sell surplus youngsters (immobile n gabbiadini) for talents we want (morata).

On the bright side, Raiola was pushing for this move, and it’s not exactly a bad thing to have him on our side.

Thats seriously scary, considering how Evra is being more and more stable defensively and Caceres looked really exposed going forward- not to mention his (would be) lack of overlaps (deep crosses aside- he’s really good on deep crosses i’ll give you that).
And we would be throwing away Evra-Pogba amazing understanding on the field going forward- thats seriously valuable (France teammates).
I used to be on the getting-rid-of-Evra bandwagon- but left long ago.

As for CL, Llorente, ironically, has played his best games against Real last year and against Olympiakos this year. He is both off-form and suffering the tactical changes. Matri is backup on the same level as Llorente this year. Both I would play ahead of Coman if Tevez is missing simply because Coman is a gamble with long odds.

The relatively small wages (for Chelsea) are 6 million euros or 85,000 pounds per week. That is way above Juve’s salary cap. 30 million euros for the transfer is also by itself over and above what we can shell out for a transfer. The link below also reports another 5 million euros in bonuses and 2 million euros in agent fees.

Regarding Matri, I think he would fit our current system better than Llorente. Our current tactics don’t call for a lot of crosses from the wings, and require a more mobile focal point. Llorente is not that player. Matri is more opportunistic around the box and has experience playing with a strike partner or as a target man. He is certainly more mobile than Llorente, which could prevent him from being too isolated.
Morata brings pace, directness, and ability to take on and turn defenders. He does need to work on his finishing and decision making though.

(I’m excluding known world beaters like Osvaldo, Matri and Boriello naturally). That means Zaza is a likely option. I’m assuming that 4-3-2-1/4-3-3 will be the way forward for this team. So bringing Berardi (who honestly would be like a major marquee signing) in, means we can play a 4-3-2-1 with Tevez and Berardi supporting Morata, and Coman, Pereyra and Zaza all subbing in, and when Carlitos isn’t playing, that can easily transition into a 4-3-3. I’d think that Zaza and Berardi were certainties to come in over the summer. With that being the case, I’m not sure investing 25-30 mill on ANOTHER attacking player at the time who would be new to the squad is the wisest of choices. We’d have a totally unfamiliar attack… I think Pereyra is a solid back-up option with plenty of upside. I think he can be a quality player, if not world class. And on paper this attack seems vastly superior to the one we have now. It also means we have a year to phase Tevez out and Berardi and Coman in, before we can actually spend big on another attacking midfielder/wide forward in 2016 when Tevez will almost definitely leave.
With Rugani also coming in to shore up the defense, meaning one of Barzagli-Bonucci-Ogbonna are likely to leave, I’d think we should invest that 25-30 million you’re suggesting on a quality left back. Jose Gaya perhaps?

While Zaza, Berardi, Morata and Coman get more Serie A and Juventus experience next to the likes of Tevez and Pereyra, we have options to scout about and find someone, a Mr.X if you will, to really take our attack to the next level the year Tevez leaves. A marquee signing. No, I think spending on pereyra, Zaza and Berardi this summer would be a significant improvement to our attack, and we can focus on spending more n a quality left back. With Pirlo, Pogba, Marchisio, Vidal, Sturaro and Asamoah, our midfield is well covered. We can afford to phase Pirlo out too. I don’t think it too wise to keep him beyond 2016.

We have Coman and Zaza too and I think they deserve minutes as first subs in and rotation strikers. That means we need one more player, yes? In today’s day and age, it is hard to find good quality backup for cheap. Especially for a club like ours. Do not forget that our attack used to be Matri-Vucinic-Quags and Bendtner/Boriello once upon a time. For 15 million, we get Pereyra who has shown enough to suggest he would grow into a good player, if not a world class one. He would have major experience in both Serie A, and with this team already by then.

I can see him playing as one of the 2 in the X’mas tree, or as a RW in a 4-3-3 with ease. I want us to go ahead and start with Berardi. And invest the money we could put into a Mata or Mkhtriyan into a quality left back, the only position where we don’t have high quality options. If the scenario I’m suggesting comes to pass, I’m suggesting we redeem Pereyra simply to be the sub-in for Berardi, and fill in in midfield where required. Your Mr.X? Yeah, for me its Berardi.

This is my logic -
I’d like to be able to play several systems:
Xmas tree (CAM &/or sometimes Berardi)
Diamond midfield (CAM)
4-3-3 (Berardi & sometimes CAM)
4-2-3-1 (CAM & Berardi)
I think having a quality CAM/TQ is essential in addition to Berardi because I think we have trouble unlocking defenses.
With Morata and Zaza we’ll have good classic strikers. With Berardi and Coman we’ll have good wingers. And Tevez is Tevez. But none are attacking mids.
We seem to miss that great link between mid and strikers.
I wouldn’t see it as meaning Berardi shouldn’t play. In some formations it would be one or the other but both could play in some.
Also, Berardi would be good as a wide mid IMO just like Real use James there.
I’m a believer that not everyone has to play all the time. Different players for different situations. All part of the one Juve spirit.
I just feel that attack-wise we’re cutrently missing three things:
1. Winger
2. CAM/TQ
3. World class striker
1 Berardi can do.
2 We don’t have.
3 We won’t buy til Tevez leaves.

The way vidal has been playing and getting injured, asamoah would be solid because he does the defensive work so well and has something to offer in attack.

As a matter of fact some of you here rate his passing to be so superb while i do agree with that to an extent it also causes many deficiencies in our play, such as slowing the game down to much, to many backward possession, lack of defense strength, tactical in-flexibilities (if man marked or change of formation he becomes more of a liability). Alot of Pirlo’s flaws lie in his slowing down the game and not recycling the ball quickly enough which allow the opposition to get close enough to him to make a challenge but it also a unique part of his game, in that that extra time can be used to send a long ball to a player attacking space in the opposition area. All in all at his age he does not have a future with us so it would be best to start preparing for the likely.
Also I would like to say i am fine with management transfer moves this winter but hopefully this summer can see us finally land that one player to make us a UCL contender/ champion.
In : Zaza, Berardi, Reus (this maybe our only chance to sign a world class winger/AM without us having to sell any of our assets), new LB and Rugani ( only if we sell someone or someone leaves and Caceres is converted to RB otherwise leave him on loan he needs playing time, even though I believe this is the end of Wallzagli stay in turin at leats the Juve side of it )
Out: Llorente, Tevez (if he isnt going to extend then it maybe best to take the chance to get Reus), Pepe ( wish he didnt get injured but moving forward there isnt room for him), Gio & Motta (done gone , Yes :D ), Padion, Romulo, Marrone, Evra, De Ceglie",juvetrini ,"Feb 3, 2015 ", 9:07 AM,

Umm about the defensive cover part it was true with Conte, but under Allegri Pirlo became really good defensively, obviously not anywhere near expert or as good as Marchisio and Vidal, but he is no longer a ""liability"" defensively. Also the slowing of game and all of his flaws has to do with the fact that he was superb in this position with Italy and Juventus throughout the years, now he is not as good as before, but we still can play fast paced footballer with Pirlo in the team, I just can’t see a clear reason why he wouldn’t make us do it.",COSMOB3AR ,"Feb 3, 2015 ", 10:38 AM,

Open Transfer Deadline Day Thread,Danny Penza,"Feb 2, 2015, 2:57am PST",,"Decided to compare forwards a bit for the remainder of this season + what to expect next season.
Okay, so:
iturbe + Doumbia + Ibarbo + Ljajic + Totti + Gervinho= ~80 million.
Pretty questionable business if you aren’t playing FIFA. Although I rate Doumbia, not so sure if he’s going to have TOO much of an impact.
to compare that:
Juve’s Attack evolution (prospective):
Tevez (~13) + Morata (~20) + Llorente (Free) + Berardi (15 if purchased before July, or some bullshit like that) + Zaza (~15) + Matri (1.25 salary the other half paid by milan)= ~64 million
Now, let’s compare these numbers a little bit.
over the last two seasons, our forwards (or those we will have shortly) combined for 128 goals (2013/14-2014/15 SO FAR).
Over the last two seasons, Roma’s forwards combined for 95 goals (2013/2014-2014/2015).
Roma Average age of these signings and starters: 26.6667 years
Juve Average age of these players: 25.6667
These co-ownership deals definitely look like they’re helping us out, not only that, but so is Beppe. I would’ve included Destro in this count, but he is gone now, so I guess I just wanted to show (more for myself than anyone else) how much our forward line has changed from signing Amauri to the deal Marotta has been snatching. Even when compared to the attacking reinforcements made by Walter Sabatini (arguably one of the best guys at the job in Italy at finding talent), Juve seem to come out on top in terms of quality/cost, goals/cost, and my personal favorite, the fact that Juve came out on top with the younger strikeforce, and more italians.
I completely get the fact that this doesn’t really show anything important, data is sort of cherrypicked (I was too lazy to compare all forwards, too lazy to really make sure my numbers were perfect, etc.)
Just sort of gives me a rough idea about how Marotta has changed the team so far, and how he’s building for the future as well.

I’m sure most people here agree Morata could potentially be the next great striker, so let the guy play more ffs.

Allegri just has to show him that faith and trust. I do admire Allegri’s continued support and faith in Llorente, when most managers would have tossed a player in that state aside for good.
That being said, Llorente has not repaid Allegri’s faith in him with goals, or at the very least, solid performances. There comes a time when he has to put his trust in another striker, and right now, that is Morata. He is young, talented, and has proven that he can impact a game in a positive manner. It’s up to the coach to build the young gun up.
Llorente has been really bad this season, but I don’t think he is an Amauri 2.0. He has always been a top forward, not world class, but one of real quality. I don’t know exactly what it is that is preventing him from regaining his form from seasons past. I almost want to believe that he feels threatened by Morata’s arrival in the summer, much like the way Borriello’s arrival in January of 2012 adversely affected Matri. Some players see situations like this and get fired up to prove that they are the man for the job, but could Llorente be slumping because of a new signing?
Could it be complacency? If so, he may need some significant time on the bench to light a fire under his ass. We’ve all seen how this has affected our perennial scudetto winning squad. Allegri needs to challenge his players and boss up to show that players have to earn their spots and deliver.

Do you expect it to be easy scoring against a team that is defending with all their players? One of the main reasons we couldn’t score was of our two strikers, Tevez and Llorente where just miserable this match. When Morata joined we had way more chances, if he started we could’ve won the game, not to mention if Tevez was in form.
Furthermore, how horrific did our midfield look w/o Vidal & Marchisio?
I call that bullshit, defensively we looked as solid as ever, and that’s where Vidal and Marchisio’s presence would’ve mattered (if we actually where bad defensively, apparently we where solid).

It’s playing a rigid 3-5-2 with a slow build up against teams that park the bus which is the problem.
I’ve played as a striker at a reasonable level before and the absolute worst thing you want in a match is to play a team that sits back with its entire defence and have your own team play a slow build up which ends up with the ball out wide and a cross swung in or looped over the top or played into your feet where twenty defenders have had half an hour to organize themselves to have three men sitting on your arse while your static and then just pick you off all day.
It doesn’t work.
Forwards need space and / or quick ball to take advantage of people off guard. The type if striker who maybe can succeed in a slow 3-5-2 v a parked bus is a tall guy who is very good in the air (even then its boring, relies on good crossing and only a few chances come per game). Or you need a very good advanced playmaker like a Messi. Re the first example our Llorente is not on song (he had one great chance to score like this). Most of our other chances were in the counter or rarer quicker movements.
The rigid 3-5-2 just does not suit our slow possession style football and they way teams defend against us.

Disagree – Udinese were set up to counter attack fast. Also true that our 352 especially with Marchisio and Vidal missing is ironically, susceptible to counter attacks.

Also hear what you’re saying about the counter. Marchisio is often stifling the counter.
The thing is, I think we’re surprisingly less vulnerable defensively with the back four Max formation (especially when Pirlo not playing) because we tend to commit less men forwards and involve the central defenders less in attacking play which leaves us more stable in attack.
Some of these factors would have stabilized compensated for our loss of better defending midfielders.

They lack pace, and are just as uncreative as Llorente but with smaller bodies. Cassano just ended his contract so all that’s left is negotiating with the player. No doubt he will come on board if we come calling. Plus Max has said it’s a possibility.
Cassano is terrific playing behind the strikers as well as up front. He gives us a number of options, while the others would just bring more of the same and only serve for rotation.
4-3-2-1 with Morata up front and Tevez/Cassano behind.
4-3-1-2 with Cassano at TQ. Or Pereyra at TQ and Cassano/Tevez up front.
We could be playing some dangerous, creative and clinical football. Of course the dream would be some fast, counterattacking wingers but that just isn’t happening.
Finally, most of our reservations lie with Cassano’s bad boy attitude. Ask yourself this: Can he really do any damage to this group? I don’t buy the idea that Cassano will destroy the locker room with his ""attitude problems"". This Juventus squad is too professional and experienced for that.

Caceres: 6.5 great game by Caceres, my man of the match.
Bonucci: 5.5 quite, didn’t do much.
Chellini: 6.5 another great game by chiello! he’s back in form!
Pirlo: 6.5 a fine game did what he needed to do successfully.
Pogba: 6.5 a good game by Pogba, he did a few mistakes but almost all our attacks included him..
Licht: 5.5 Meh game, didn’t do much offensively.
Evra: 5.5 Just like Licht.
Tevez: 5 He was man marked to death, no real chances except the one he wasted.
Llorente: 5 No impact what so over on the game. Did a few good passes but that’s it.
Padoin: 6 made the left side much more lively.
Morata: 6.5 you could see the immediate change when he came in for Llorente, Morata definitely needs to start EVERY important game.
Allegri: 4.5 the main reason for our tie, he shouldn’t ever go with 7 defensive players against Udinese. Why the fuck would you do that, and again, the 3-5-2 is another reason for this low rating.",COSMOB3AR ,"Feb 1, 2015 ", 8:11 AM,
Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Udinese,Danny Penza,"Feb 1, 2015, 4:45am PST","Wow, you're really harsh on our defence!","Buffon was killer, saved us when we needed him and provided more passion than anyone else on the pitch for us (""cazzo!""). I’d give him a 7.
Caceres also deserves a 7 in my opinion. His passes were on point all game long, and he was very good at tracking back. Also offered a lot when going forward, way more than our usual CBs in a 3-5-2.
Bonucci should get a 6.5 if you ask me. Was the general on defence, as per usual, directing everyone and playing very deep. Also played opponents offside on multiple occasions, killing off a few dangerous opportunities. Good game by him.
Evra at least deserves a 6. Played quite a sound defensive game compared to usual and had some good link-up play with Pogba going forward. Nothing spectacular, but he didn’t make many, if any, mistakes.
I think most of the blame for this draw lays on Allegri’s choice of tactics for the match. I imagine he figured this would be a low-risk game to try the old 3-5-2 in again, and I think he may have wanted to see how Llorente would do in this formation, as he hasn’t been spectacular in our 4-3-1-2. The experiment failed, and I don’t think we’ll be seeing much of the 3-5-2 for the rest of the season.

It’s probably not realistic for us before 2016, when Tevez will in all probability leave [according to his own words] and a new attacker(s) will be brought in. Let’s hope that by that time, Coman and Berardi would make significant progress.
Of all the awesome players moving around this month, too bad Juve didn’t go for an unorthodox move – Look at Roma, they got Doumbia, who I been pitching for this team for at least 3 transfer windows now; I believe he will do well in the Serie A.
The Cuadrado dream is dead; I feel we could have given Schuerrle a go, or even Salah. What sucks my nut is the De Ceglie move: is Evra + PDC a mere stop-gap solution until the summer mercato? And Matri? What is the purpose of these signings? To save money for the summer mercato? Will Juve ever SPEND?
It’s unacceptable that Juve is a slumbering European giant.

Sure, we are 76.4% towards a 4th scudetto (I did not recheck the math), still in the Coppa Italia, and playing in the CL QFs but I am yet to see a dominant Juve in Italy and CL.
Look at Serie A. Allegri lost countless opportunities to stretch the lead in January. We dropped at least 4 points against weaker opposition. If Roma had a stronger squad (or better coach) Juventus may not even be first.
How about CL? He has gone just as far as Conte in his first season. Now we are playing against Monaco and everyone is acting as though we are going to make it into the semis. What if we don’t? Will Allegri be a failure then? This year Juve won 5 games, tied 1, and lost 2.
I am not saying that he is terrible, but he is doing what should be expected from a coach training this Juventus squad. Sure, some others may say the same for Conte’s first scudetto. With players like Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio, Licht, and Vucinic he should have done well.
What would make it for me is some unexpected achievement. Beating Fiorentina by more than a goal in Florence in a week will certainly do that. If Juve were to make it to the CL semis, we are likely to play a European heavyweight. Making it through against one of those teams would certainly change my mind about how good Allegri is.
Should his contract be renewed? Absolutely, after all he is doing his job well. Is he a superb tactician or motivator along the lines of il Trapp or Lippi? I am yet to see that. However, the opportunity to showcase such talent has not been possible yet.

I feel as though, we haven’t really won the Scudetto, moreso, teams around us (Roma) haven’t just completely lost it. Far too often this season we’ve relied on individual brilliance to get us the 3 points in Serie A matches – which I just don’t like.
In regards to the CL, we basically played 5-6 shit matches, through the group stages to be perfectly frank, and were even 30 mins away from being knocked out. We’ve been handed a dream draw, a pretty weak groupstage, a really poor Dortmund and the weakest team – on paper – still in the Quarters. If we do not get past Monaco, is it is a deadset failure. We’re not going to get too many better opportunities to be in the semi’s of the CL.
Beating Fiorentina by more than a goal in Florence in a week will certainly do that. If Juve were to make it to the CL semis, we are likely to play a European heavyweight. Making it through against one of those teams would certainly change my mind about how good Allegri is.

Do you think Tevez has done enough to be considered a small time club legend? And if not, what would be considered enough within the next 2-3 years for him to cement his place in Juve history?
I guess winning the UCL would be the obvious answer, but if he doesn’t win it, what would you consider enough.
Also, even though I’ve made it abundantly clear that i’m a Tevez fanboy, I feel the need to reiterate. I LOVE TEVEZ. So if Barca don’t progress to the UCL final to win, I want Juve to take it all. Not because I’m head over heels in love with Juve, but because … well … TEVEZ.",Abdul S. ,"Mar 30, 2015 ", 7:11 PM,
Juventus midfielder Claudio Marchisio returns to training just four days after ACL injury scare,Danny Penza,"Mar 30, 2015, 4:20pm PDT",,"Greetings Abdul! Well, Tevez most likely won’t be playing in Turin after next season as he has stated that he would like to return to his boyhood club, where he will play out the rest if his career, after his current contract expires with Juventus.
I honestly think Tevez has earned a spot as a small time legend as a Juve player. He has honored the 10 shirt, one which very few can wear without being crushes by the weight of the legends who wore it before. The fact that Tevez seemed to have this reputation of a troublesome player who managers had a tough time dealing with, but upon his arrival in Turin, he really took on the responsibility of being the leader of the front line. He soaked in and bought the idea of lo stile Juve and has worked tremendously hard on and off the pitch to find the best form of his career.
What fans love about him aside from his goals are his unrelenting spirit and never-say-die attitude. He is a tireless worker, but a genuine person from humble beginnings who has not lost his ways, rather he remains grounded and attached to what made him the person and player he is today. The bad boy image he was painted in has proven to be but a byproduct of an ill suited environment. Turin is much more calming and relaxing, where players can focus on football, and Tevez has found that serenity here, like many players do.
In his first season he nearly won the capocannoniere, weighing in with 21 goals in all comps, something no forward had done in quite a number of years at Juve. This season, he is well on his way to winning the title of top scorer in Serie A, has found his scoring touch in the CL as well.
He can elevate his status if he could help Juve overturn the deficit in the coppa semis against Fiorentina and help us go on to win the cup, something evading us for nearly two decades. Of course, winning the CL with Juve would propel him to the higher echelons of club legend status, but I think if he ends the season as the leading goal scorer, something Juve have not boasted since our days of Del Piero and Trezeguet, he will be loved even more.
I hope this answered your question. Cheers!",Nuncio#7 ,"Mar 30, 2015 ", 8:04 PM,

It’s easy to like Tevez, Messi or a team like Barcelona or Real Madrid…but when you follow a team through hell and back it says something about you as a fan. When you stand by your team through everything. I remember when we Italians were killing the Spanish sides. Im not sure if Abdul was a fan back then, as his name suggests he was born in 1995.

The older generation claims to have supported their team through thick and thin, which I’m not doubting, yet somehow don’t think the newer fans would do the same. I couldn’t support Barca before the 2000’s for a simple reason, I was 5 years old, as you so rightly guessed, making me realize how stupid it was to put my DOB in my username. I’ve changed the username, but not the team I support, and never will. I’ve stood behind Barca since 2006, and always watch their games. In the past 3 years, I can’t remember a single game that I missed. I watched every game down to the pre-season friendlies, waking up early in the morning to watch them play some small team from half way across the world. I watched both losses against Bayern, 4-0 and 3-0, and didn’t miss a single minute down to the 180th. So you see, I’ll always support Barca not because of Messi, but because of the history, tradition, rivalries, and emotions you feel from losing a game. As you’ll always support Juve. I’m not doubting your loyalty to this club, nor will I ever, yet you easily doubt mine to my club. That is something I don’t appreciate.
As for liking specific players, everyone has their preferences. No way am I believing the you liked Juve right away, unless you are from Turin, or Italy and were raised to like the club. Everyone has their gateway to whatever club they like. Mine was Ronaldinho, alot of Barca fans love Messi, Some Real Madrid fans like Zidane or Raul. I hear it all the time, even from the fans of the older generations. ""Maradona made me love Napoli"" or ""Cruyff drew me Ajax"". Every club has their legends. Suffice to say, that’s why I was asking about Tevez’s legendary status at this club.
I apologies if my lack of Juve fandom offends you, but that’s your problem, not mine. Usually when commenting on the Real Madrid SB nation blog, it’s protocol to announce yourself as a Barca fan, or a Madrid fan if your doing the opposite. I don’t know how it works here. And as you may have noticed by reading many of your friends comments, they don’t mind me hanging around here. So, NO. I won’t do YOU the favor of pissing off because of your ill temper.

I remember Heysel very well, I was watching the madness unfold on TV and couldn’t believe my eyes. I will never forget a man, with a beard and heavy set, sort of like Pavarotti, who was crying/screaming out for help while he was being crushed. I was 14 at the time and that was the first time I realized how real death was. Later that year there was the Achille Lauro hijacking, and then the attack at El Al/Fuimicino, but I had nightmares about Heysel throughout my childhood.
If anyone wants to understand what it’s like to be caught up in a crowd crush, and the psychological mindset of a Hooligan, read Bill Buford’s ‘Among the Thugs’. He went with Manchester United supporters to Torino for the Cup Winners Cup semifinal in 1984 (if I remember correctly?) and basically documents in a very objective way how the English fans shit all over the city, pissed and vomited in the fountains, kicked and beat up anyone who was in their way, robbed/destroyed/looted cafes and storefronts.

5 months or 5 days, Marchisio has been showing obvious signs of fatigue and overwork. It was obvious something was going to happen to him.

As much as people might think you sound like a pussy, these things bed to be listened to. When the body gets fatigued things start to crack.
A game or two off here or the isn’t going to break the bank. I’d far prefer to drop a point or two in serie A and have these guys for for a season than to have guys like Pogba and Marchisio etc out for weeks at a time.

I mean obviously Morata deserves all the credit for his own talent but 9months with Juve and he goes from being a bench warmer to scoring regularly in Serie A, CL and now for the full Spain side.
Juve is an institution now at breeding successful players.
I thing Andrea Agnelli is a very shrewd (business) man and along with the management team he has brought in (Marotta, Paratici) they will build a mammothly strong and stable Juventus that will get to that stage (which its almost already at) where the club will have success independent of individual figures because of the overall set up and culture of the club.
They have such long term stable forward looking plans and seem unwavering and solid in setting about achieving them.
I think Juve has extremely bright decades of football success ahead.
When Gianni Agnelli passed on I was worried about the future. But with Andrea in charge I am very excited.

I still believe that the Elkanns have done more damage than good to Juventus, and for him to say this in public is idiotic and very lack of Lo Stile, but I think Elkann does have a point.
Conte and his staff is there to pick the best Italian footballers for the national team, and it is safe to say that those best footballers are considered ‘best’ for at least a reason, that they’re playing regularly and regularly good. Which means that those players are already in their best physical condition when their joining the Azzurri camp, so it’s not really necessary to work them hard the way Conte did.
Conte complaned in the past that Prandelli was ‘impolite’ for not consulting him about the condition of his players, mind you… Prandelli never worked up the players, he simply warm them up and tell them the tactic he’s going to employ for the players to interpret and execute, now Conte is being worse than the man he once critisized.

Was Juve-Conte out of line when wanting his players to return not injured and in best physical condition so he can perform at his best and have the team performing at their best? No, he’s just a control freak and pretty sure we all supported him then.
But Prandelli also has to make sure he uses the best players at his disposal and ensure he and the Italy team perform at their best.
There are surely better ways to communicate what was said then and what has been said now. I still don’t think this whole thing makes Conte a hypocrite, the injury is unfortunate and I don’t think any of his comments this time have been out of line.
To me it looks like the attitude shift from praise to hate that stemmed from Conte’s departure is still very present around these parts and clearly seen in bitter comments about him being a hypocrite or ""fuck Conte"" and when no one is saying it is Conte’s fault about the injury it is very much implied due to the nature of the comments, because ""hey we hate that guy so fuck him!"" it’s his fault.",cugino1897 ,"Mar 28, 2015 ", 8:10 AM,

But this isn’t FIFA where you can just throw players on the pitch and expect everything to click. Conte made the team just that, a TEAM. You read reports today from the likes of Pogba and Morata about how wonderful it is to play here in Turin? And you see videos of Storari going to the primavera pitch with flags to cheer on Barzagli? That team spirit and foundation was instilled into this team by Conte. Remember what it was like the two years before that? Under Zac and Del Neri? It was open warfare. It was a hell hole. Conte didn’t wave a magic wand and make leaders, but he created the atmosphere in which the likes of Vidal and Bonucci and Marchisio embraced their leadership. He helped bring it to the fore. He turned good players like Marchisio, Vidal, Lichtsteiner, Bonucci etc. into WINNERS. He gave us that winning mentality. He taught them how to embrace the Juventus spirit of Fino Alla Fine. He taught them how to respect the shirt they where.
Marotta and Paratici deserve massive applause for the work they’ve done. Their recruitment policy has been nothing short of genius. But don’t forget. They came in 2010. With Del Neri. Not with Conte in 2011. They helped lay the foundation. But be under no illusions.. Stop being so swayed by the negatives and the firey arrogant man you see in interviews.. Don’t be so quick to forget pre-2011. Antonio Conte is the one who brought us from the wilderness back and turned this unit into a well-drilled machine. A hungry winning machine at that. And this isn’t a Mourinho squad. This team is like a platoon. They fight for EACHOTHER. They feel honoured to be in Turin playing for La Vecchia Signora, and the team harmony lets it shine. Sure, he wasn’t perfect, but I doubt any other man could do what he did for us.
Today, Conte rows in the media with Elkaan.. I blame this on Elkaan. If it truly has gone to the extent where a man like Conte can receive death threats from our own faithful.. Because Marchisio pulled up in a PRE-training warm up… It is appalling.
Right now it is cool to hate on Conte, so let’s… I don’t remember an awful lot of this ""Marrota, Paratici"" tune when we were in chaos in the summer, we had a coach we didn’t want and we had just signed Evra, Morata and Pereyra….",Kaushik_10 ,"Mar 28, 2015 ", 9:14 PM,

I’m just saying that we’ve become a little spoiled over the last few years, and it becomes easy to jump on the trending hate train. We FOUGHT for Conte for 3 years. Was his resigning bad timing? Yes. But remember something, I am 100% sure he resigned at the end of last year and it was the board who pushed him to reconsider. To take a holiday and return to Vinovo and then see how he felt. I respect him for limiting the damage by standing up on day 2 itself and saying he could take this team no further. A not motivated Conte? Can you imagine what this season could have imploded and stagnated into?
It was unfortunate, but it was the right move. And we’re now better off because of it.
At that time, all of us were hating on Beppe. Simply because he doesn’t have Agnelli’s name and isn’t Pavel Nedved (The other board members). The outrage over Allegri’s appointment was IMMENSE. The outrage over missing out on Iturbe and getting Morata (with a buyback clause) and Pereyra (on loan with option to buy from Udinese) was immense. Hating on Beppe was cool at the time and we were all heading towards catastrophe.
8 months later, Marchisio pulls up in the light warm up before training begins, the Italy doctors make a hash of it, and suddenly Conte is a pussy, and is worthy of death threats…. Wut?
I think it’s the truth. We’re all passionate football fans. We need SOMETHING to complain about time to time. Haha.. And we’ve had a spoiled few years at that. I just hope we can maintain some degree of objectivity. We owe a lot to Antonio Conte.

His apparent defeatism in European Championships was not welcome and one of the reasons I did not claim the world is falling when he decided to leave.

I think he should be the target man, but if Conte is going to continue to play two forwards, he should not start another striker similar to Zaza. Immobile’s technical skill is inferior to that of Zaza, and his positioning seems off quite often (offsides), but only offers direct running in return.
Conte should pair him with a more creative partner, or even better, change the formation. He called up Vazquez, use him as a TQ in a 3-4-1-2 if he persists with a back three or a 4-3-1-2.
I think this Italy team may be it’s best if Conte utilizes a 4-3-2-1 formation. Zaza leading the line, with Candreva and Gabbiadini in behind his left and right respectively. Verratti, Marchisio (injured) and De Rossi as the central three would be a solid midfield.
This is where things get tricky, does Italy have a capable LB? Darmian can play both right and left, and has shown to be very good on either flank, but if he moves to the left, who covers the right? De Sciglio seems to have regressed, but that drop in firm could also be attributed to frequent injury/poor treatment of such injuries by MilanLab and the woeful shape of the Milan team as a whole, nonetheless, we lack another competent FB.

Losing two players that are THAT influential to the team could, realistically, just be too much. Suddenly, that 14pt lead is extremely convenient, if it had been less than 8 (and if Roma wouldn’t be self-destructing) then the Scudetto coulda been in serious danger, but thankfully that should be ok.

On being denied a new contract, Mainz’s 36 year old goalkeeper (Muller) has successfully sued the club for breach of German labour laws. The German court has decreed that footballers are to be considered as any other workers and hence they are eligible for an indefinite contract if they had worked previously on 2 year contract with their employer. The court also decreed that the contract expiry date would no longer be valid under the current Labour Laws.
Mainz are obviously going to appeal the decision. For all you non-EU guys, a law confirmed in appeal like this will probably end in the European court. If confirmed again, all the EU member states will very probably be forced to adopt it. Imagine, a Real Madrid having to pay 100’s of ex-footballers until pension age!

No coincidence it happened when the two senior Agnellis died. Moggi had been grooming Andrea Agnelli to take over, the Elkans wanted the club for their branch. One of them was on the board at Gazzetta (so I’ve read, don’t take this as fact) who were releasing the wiretaps. The Calciopoli scandal was orchestrated by Inter, but was also a way to remove the triad and stop Andrea Agnelli becoming president. Only after a series of fuck-ups was Andrea allowed to take over and we now see the benefits; Marotta, Nedevd, Paratici all appointed and the club back where it belongs. I’ve read in a number of places that Agnelli still goes to Moggi for advice.
Why did the club not put up a proper defence? Secco and Blanc were installed very quickly and the club instantly acknowledged guilt and said it would stand by any punishment give out. There are loads of murky details not out yet and that may never come out. Galliani possibly involved because Moggi was allegedly moving to Milan to replace Galliani.

I like the potential of Berardi a lot more. Buy him outright and loan him to allow him to grow. Coman should probably be allowed to play elsewhere as well. Early in the season when I saw him he looked great, but the past couple times not so much. I havent watched every single game so maybe you could correct me on that?
Other than Dybala I think the main priority this mercato is secure the youngsters (Berardi/Rugani) And get rid of some deadweight (Ogbonna/Llorente).

Whether Dybala is an opportunity or not will largely depend on the player and the clubs interested. With one year left in his contract, Dybla could force a move anywhere, whereas Zamparini would like to cash in as high as possible.
Let’s imagine that we get Dyabla.
At this point, Juventus would have a host of of young players leading our forward line. Next September, Zaza would be 24, Morata 22, Dybala and Berardi 21. How much playing time would they see if Tevez continues his amazing form? How do you play? 4-3-3 where would that leave Tevez? 4-3-1-2, where does that leave Berardi? 4-2-3-1 could work with Morata-Dybala-Berardi playing behind Tevez/Zaza but where does that leave our midfield? With Pogba, Marchisio, Vidal, Pirlo, Asamoah and now Sturaro fighting for two spots. Or we just become like a chameleon and switch formations as injuries or fatigue happens? I don’t think we are quite there yet.
Integrating three new players in attack would be a challenge to say the least. Now if that attack is the most prolific in Serie A, with a certain Carlitos Tevez bulldozing anything in front of him, integrating three such players will be exceedingly difficult. Remember that Rugani and likely a new goalkeeper will need to be introduced to the team.
As exciting as Dybala would be, I think Juventus need to be cautious to change too much too quickly. After Conte’s first year, changes have been slow and steady keeping the backbone of the team constant while improving those areas that need improvement. During Conte’s second season it was Asa and Pogba, the third season was Tevez and Llorente, this season was Morata and to a lesser extent Pereyra.

Allegri’s 433 seems to be more like his 4321 in sense tht the wide duo has the freedom to drop deep/stay wide/cut inside. If one of them cuts inside to support the striker the other stays wide to stretch the def and provide support to fbs and mids.
If Allegri’s time at Milan is any indication to his future in Juve meaning he will change formations quite a bit he had used 433/4321/4312/4231 in Milan so if he had similar personnel for rotation here, he can change the formation accordingly so players can play in their best position and be happy.

In light of Conte’s inclusion of Eder (Samp) and Vazquez (Palermo) in the recent Italy squad set to play in Euro qualifiers this weekend, the Inter boss let loose some incredibly dumb comments (in my opinion) relative to whether or not foreign-born, naturalized Italians should be eligible to play for Italy.
""The Italy national team should be Italian … Maybe we find some players in the Italy squad who are not Italian but only have some relatives here, but this is only my opinion … I think that an Italian player deserves to play in the Italian national team while those who were not born in Italy, even if they have [Italian] relatives, don’t deserve it. We do so much to bring through young players and then we go and call up the foreigners [who are eligible to play] for Italy.""
Skip the irony, perhaps, of the FUCKIGN INTER MILAN coach saying this and move on to this fact: Mancini, no doubt, is fully aware of the history of oriundi on the nazionale (a team he played for, no less!) and cannot claim ignorance of this tradition here. For a culture as proud of and obsessed with their national team as Italians are, it is baffling that Mancini wouldn’t be more understanding and respectful of the legacy of names such as Sivori, Orsi, Camoranesi, Cesarini, Altafini, et al.
Italy has 4 World Cup trophies and, interestingly, on each of those squads, there was at least one oriundo who contributed heavily to the team. Add this to the fact that it’s 2015 and the cultural landscape of most Western nations seems to be changing to be more inclusive and diverse.

But some people really do value playing for a brand like Real Madrid and I can imagine that the soft spot in Alvaro’s heart for his childhood club is considerable. I do think that Juve is doing all the club can to express to Morata that the atmosphere in Torino is perfect to turn him into a star – and im sure the recent Roja call up helps to show him his development so far at Juve.
There are many players who would opt for a ‘brand increase’, so to speak, over guaranteed playing time. Even on the smaller scale, look at Ogbonna going from captain and surefire starter with Torino to 4th or 5th option at CB at Juve. I’m also reminded of Alex Song leaving Arsenal for Barca – knowing full well that he was desperately needed by the Gunners but little more than a squad rotation man with the blaugrana.
In the end, I think Morata is our forward for the future – he seems happy and relaxed, integrated himself pretty seamlessly into a very tightly knit squad, and (most importantly) is getting better and better with each start. I don’t see him opting to take a substitutes role at RM behind Benzema, particularly if Juve are guaranteeing him starts and hes getting consistent call ups to Spain.

Also considering where Song’ is playing at the moment I think even he’d agree that he’d made a bad decision.
I think also these days when RM signs top players outside their youth system they tend to be ridiculously hyped, and given a guaranteed starting spot (esp in attack – CR7, Bale etc.). I simply doubt Morata will reach those levels within 2 years, or as you say silly enough to think that he can displace RM’s BBC in two years. The best he could achieve realistically in 2 years at RM is competing with someone like Isco.

If he’s serious about wanting to remain in Italy, then I don’t think he’s that much of a risk.

First of all Sassuolo paid 10M to Juve for Zaza a year ago and now we will buy him for 15M, so the real cost is only 5M.
2. Lllorente will probably be sold in the summer, and we need a strong physical striker in squad. Yes i agree Berardi, Dybala, Coman are all better players in term of skills and are certantly more excaiting, but are all the same type of players. We need at least one target man in our team.
3. Even if he flops big time, he will still be young one year from now and his value will stay high and we can sell him, so I think it would be a smart decision to give him a chance next year.
About Dybala: I think he will be a great player in the future, but i doubt that Marotta is willing to spend more than 20M (maybe 20m + some players) for player in the last year of his contract and with a lot of other teams interested in him I dont think it will be enough.

Report: Paulo Dybala prefers Juventus move despite interest from Arsenal,Danny Penza,"Mar 23, 2015, 6:00am PDT",Latest on Dybala & Zaza,"Ok, so according to Sky Italia, who are usually pretty accurate, the strategy is as follows. Dybala wants to come to Juve to stay in Italy, but especially to play alongside Tevez for a year. There are meetings with Arsenal later this week, but Juve are more likely to get him unless his price gets inflated too much. Marotta will not pay more than €25m plus players, similar to the Iturbe situation. It looks likely Llorente will leave with Zaza arriving as a direct replacement which will look good on the books and save money on wages.
Raiola met PSG, but Pogba will probably only move for a club like Real or Barca and Juve want him to stay. Cavani would cost over €100m with wages and transfer fee, so that move will only happen if Pogba is leaving, so strong rumours of a Cavani move are probably bad news. The only other way we move for a big name player is if Tevez ends up leaving for Boca this year, but that seems unlikely.
Sounds like a good strategy to me. They didn’t add anything about Berardi, but Morata, Tevez, Zaza, Dybala gives plenty of options along with Pereyra and possibly Berardi. We could also move for someone like Matri on loan as a fifth striker option. With Coman on loan somewhere like Sassuolo for a year, we could then re-evaluate in summer 2016 when Tevez goes, Madrid might make their move for Morata and clubs might go crazy for Pogba if he performs at the Euros.",Il Gigante Buono ,"Mar 25, 2015 ", 12:32 AM,

Ive been a Palermo fan for my first 5 years of seriously watching calcio because thats where my family is from, but I really wanted an Italian team to root for in Europe, so I decided to follow Juve more closely this year.
Decided it was appropriate to make my first post in this thread, because Ive seen every Palermo game this year, and followed them whenever Rai showed them in Serie B last year as well.
Dybala has definitely took a huge jump in performances from last year, but you could always tell the talent is there. Hes the best Juve can do to replace Tevez. Theyre not the same type of player per say, I would say Dybala is more similar in play style to Aguero, but who could complain with that?
His biggest strength is how smart he is. I rarely see him make a bad decision when on the ball. Always knows when its the right time to pass, or if the risk is worth it to attempt to dribble an opponent. His off ball movement is superb as well. Ideal for the modern game. He can drift wide and play well in space, and also make decisive runs behind the center backs. His finishing could use some improvement at times, but to be fair he has been robbed of a handful of goals due to random keepers pulling a Buffon on him.
His recent dip in form is mainly because of how awful Palermo’s midfield has been this year. Unless him or Vazquez create something magical they probably arent going to score. The past 5 games the midfield have been completely over run.
I saw a rumor that Juve were looking at Vazquez as well. Tbh I see Vazquez staying at least 1 more year with Palermo. But he would be a good depth player here. It would only make sense if Allegri is sticking with a 4-3-1-2. Hes a quality AM.

Juventus 1-0 Genoa: Carlos Tévez's brilliance wins it again for Bianconeri,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 22, 2015, 2:48pm PDT",,"I know what you mean, but there’s not a huge amount that needs doing to the rest of the squad. Left back is a must, possibly a young right back (although Licht and Caceres would be fine for one more year) and I’ve read they want to add a quality midfielder, even if Pogba stays (Witsel & Kondogbia are first choices). The attack is where most work could be done. Zaza sounds a done deal as a replacement for Llorente (Atleti, Sevilla and Valencia all interested), but on lower wages. Berardi would add width if Allegri wants him in the squad. Juve have offered €25m plus some loans or young players for Dybala, but dealing with Zamparini is usually difficult (although he and Marotta are friends apparently). Dybala, Zaza and Berardi would all have relatively low wages and potential re-sale value in a few years. If the opportunity to sign Falcao arose I could see us gambling on it.
It’s worth remembering that two years ago our forward line consisted of Matri, Vucinic, Quagliarella, Giovinco and Bentdner! We’ve completely reshaped the attack in a short space of time and we could potentially lose Morata and Tevez next summer as we have no control over the situation, so having quality players already settled would be an advantage. I’m not sure about the logic of adding another midfielder, unless Asamoah is viewed as a left back or sold, or if Pirlo moves on. Pogba, Vidal, Marchisio, Pirlo, Asamoah, Sturaro and Pereyra offer plenty of options for midfield.",Il Gigante Buono ,"Mar 23, 2015 ", 9:54 AM,
Juventus 1-0 Genoa: Carlos Tévez's brilliance wins it again for Bianconeri,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 22, 2015, 2:48pm PDT",,"A big NO for Falcao for me. Then again, I’m not in charge of these decisions. He has not been the same since his injury and if would not have him stunt Marotta’s growth while he tries to regain form. I understand the training for signing a world class striker, but he isn’t the one.
Cavani still produces and he has a proven track record in Serie A. From a sporting perspective, the Cavani move makes more sense, but it is not economically feasible.
I would rather stick with the Tevez/Morata duo while bringing in a more direct replacement in for Tevez. I think the player who is most similar to him is Dybala. Both can play alongside or behind the striker, on the wing. Or lead the attack themselves.
If Dybala comes, I’m not sure if Berardi returns next season, unless Coman is loaned out, which I would be ok with because he is still very much raw and needs consistent playing time to explode.
This summer I would be happy with:
Out: Llorente, Coman (loan), Pepe, Ogbonna, De ceglie, Matri (loan expires)
In: Zaza, Berardi, Dybala, Rugani, Pereyra (exercise option to buy), Darmian, pereira? (another Man U wonderkid?)",Nuncio#7 ,"Mar 23, 2015 ", 11:57 AM,

If you get the Falcao that was at Porto and Atleti then you have a genuine world class striker and another Pirlo/Tevez/Barzagli situation. If he’s not the same player as before or his knee goes again, then you don’t take up the option to sign him permanently. With the extra cash available next season I can see why Marotta might take the gamble. The only way I see us signing Cavani is if Pogba goes, which I don’t want to happen this summer.",Il Gigante Buono ,"Mar 23, 2015 ", 12:06 PM,

I would imagine they would want a return on their investment as soon as possible via a outright sale.
Cavani is definitely a better guarantee in terms of production, but like you, I would not be willing to part with Pogba for it to come to fruition.
Tevez will be in the final year of his contract next season and I kind if like the idea of him being the old goat amongst the young core of forwards we could potentially have next season. Zaza, Berardi, Dybala (Coman loaned), Morata. Morata is showing that he can take on more responsibility and become an integral part of the starting XI. After Tevez is gone, he will be 24, and can really become a leader of the attack along with Zaza.",Nuncio#7 ,"Mar 23, 2015 ", 12:59 PM,

This is ideal considering the pogba loss and I think it’s pirlo’s turn to show his European experiance and step up as we’ve seen from evra Buffon and even chiellini who had a very assured performance against Dortmund. This team is focused did u see it in evra’s eyes every time the camera panned to him in Dortmund? Because I sure did.
Look I understand the desire to not jump the gun but we are the better team and we will prove it just like we did against Dortmund. The hurdle has been cleared and I’m ready to see us go into Monaco as well as juventus stadium and play two huge statement making games because we are gonna want to send a message to all the big clubs we could see in the next round if we advance

UEFA Champions League Draw: Juventus will face Monaco in the quarterfinals,Danny Penza,"Mar 20, 2015, 4:50am PDT",,"What about a 3-4-2-1/3-4-1-2?
3-4-2-1:
Buffon
Barzagli-bonucci-chiellini
Licht-Vidal-Marchisio-Evra
Pereyra-Tevez
Morata
In a 3-4-1-2, Pereyra would move to the center behind the strikers, but seeing as Revez likes to drop deep, it essentially becomes a 3-4-2-1 anyways.
I think it is much more attacking than a 3-5-2 because of the added number of attackers, as well as the width provided by the two attacking mids/wide forwards. The wing backs also don’t have the onus if creating all of the width, therefore they do t have to push to far up; instead, they can offer support or even overload and overlap during attacking phases when necessary. Pirlo is still very much capable of playing in this set up, but it would leave Pereyra the odd man out and Vidal moving up next to Tevez.
Prandelli used this formation against Spain to great effect during the Confederations Cup. It utilizes only 2 CMs allowing one to deputize and rotate to keep them all fresh. The ability of Pereyra and Tevez to link attack and mid as well as drift wide and cut in would be similar to how Allegri has them play in a 4-3-1-2/4-3-2-1. The 3 in the back stay the same, but have a pivot in front of them as their shield as opposed to Pirlo. If Allegri utilizes his tactic of defending in two banks of four, like we saw early in the season with the 3-5-2 , it really sets us up to attack on the counter. Depending on what side the ball is on, the WB can drop deeper to the FB position as the attacking mid can drop to cover his position. The CBs just shift towards the other direction, while the opposite WB moves higher up. The two CMs tuck in and deny space in from of the box, while the opposite attacking mid and striker can roam the space between the opponent’s midfield and defenders as outlets to Uniate a counter. Essentially it becomes a 4-4-2/4-5-1 when defending.",Nuncio#7 ,"Mar 20, 2015 ", 7:54 PM,

Looking at what they can offer, I’d say that any complacency and/or underrating on our side, coach, players and fans, can be dangerous, as they are a well drilled team tactically with pretty fast wingers and an experienced attacker, and they can hurt us on the counter if we let our guard down, and let’s face it, we tend to do that; drop guard, when Juventus faces an opponent that sits deep purposefully, absorbs our possession play on the intent to break fast. We’ve seen that a few times this season.
For protocol, Monaco can play both counter-attacking and smart possession football.
I’m confident overall.
Our players have been playing together for a while now, everyone knows what they’re supposed to do, and least we forget, Juventus is also one of the best drilled teams out there, boasting one of the best defenses in Europe, and our players are no less formidable than those of Monaco’s.

UEFA Champions League Draw: Juventus will face Monaco in the quarterfinals,Danny Penza,"Mar 20, 2015, 4:50am PDT",,"Paolo you are missing 8-10m in gate money. Also your TV rights is incorrect. Serie A is allocated 80m TV Rights money for all teams. Since Napoli were kind enough to not qualify the 80m is split up in x2 40m payouts as follows:
22m for Juve and 18 million for Roma. The difference is because Juve won the Serie A.
25m for Juve (15m for Roma). This figure starts as 20m each but is paid out depending on the ration of games played by club to ratio of total games played by Serie A teams. Currently ratio stands at 10/16. Beautiful system if I say so. Roma already lost 5m by not qualifying. In total TV money should be 45m. Howvere the total figure is still approx 77m because of gate money.
So what happens if Juve win the final. Adding to the already earned 77m:-
Market Pool (games played) = +2.4m
Prize Money = +3 to +5m (5 games left including quarters at 1m per win and 0.5m per draw)
Qualification + Winning = +15.4
Gate Money = +7 to +9m (assuming gate money as per Dortmund game and not counting final. Not sure how gate money is split there)

I’ve seen a fair amount of Ligue 1 this season, mostly PSG and Marseilles but Monaco too – after their really slow start, they have come together as a team and must admit looked sensational at the Emirates but much of that was the simple fact Arsenal was slow to react to the counter. Monaco don’t score much, as they are reliant on their defense to shut other teams down – big, strong, but very young. Other than Abdennour, the other three defenders who started at the Emirates was all under 22 (Fabinho age 21, Wallace Santos age 20, and Kurzawa not sure?). I chucked when I read somewhere that Arsenal expected them to ‘park the yacht’ and on the contrary, they beat the Gunners in much the way Juve did vs BVB. Hold the line and then sliced them apart with speed and intelligent use of space.
Berbatov is looking long in the tooth, he really can’t move around much. The player to watch is Kongdogbia, he really is a special talent, and same goes for Martial (who is only still 19 I think?). Regarding Jardim, he used 4-4-3 some matches but their recent success has been with 4-2-3-1, with Moutinho running the show.
I really wish Pogba was healthy, I think he would’ve reveled playing in France and rose to the occasion. Regardless, really excited to be in the quarterfinals again!",Tre Stelline ,"Mar 20, 2015 ", 5:11 AM,

He’s a fairly decent option in a 3-man midfield for Serie A. So with Pirlo, Vidal and Marchisio as our big 3, and Sturaro, Pereyra, Padoin, Pepe and the impending return of Asamoah, we should pull through without having to RELY on the 3-5-2. We saw a lot of that kid Vitale in pre-season too. JRob is right.. Sturaro needs to see a lot of game time now. Its imperative if we do not want to see a serious drop in quality with our bench. Additionally, by playing a 4-3-3 with Tevez, Coman, Pepe etc out wide, we can test out a new formation. Or maybe even try Coman in Pereyra’s position for a few games. We do have options.
Pogba’s loss is massive.. But he is such a tremendous athlete. It was bound to happen at some point. I just really hope our traditional MVP stays fit and Allegri rotates them well and smartly now. In one game you suddenly can’t throw on a midfield of Padoin, Pereyra and Pepe. Suicide. So his man management skills will surely be tested here. Marchisio’s rest has been long pending.

Juventus 3-0 Borussia Dortmund: EuroJuve seals spot in Champions League quarterfinals,danpchavez,"Mar 18, 2015, 11:34pm PDT",Thoughts,"1) This one is almost entirely down to Allegri. I won’t talk about what Conte might or might not have done, but the way he studied Dortmund’s gameplay and strengths and set up the team over the two legs was nothing short of brilliant. So deceptively simple. They’re lightening fast on the counter, press high and get in behind defenses, solution? Play a super deep line with a narrow tight midfield and cede possession to them. Completely out thought Klopp. The mentality and belief he instilled in the team in the second leg is what this team has been lacking for years. Forza Allegri!
2) Speaking about organization. Claudio Marchisio man. TEN INTERCEPTIONS. If that wasn’t enough, the way he shielded the defense meant that they were almost NEVER left to face one-on-one’s. Dortmund were forced to go wide, where in an off colour Kampl and Reus, they were unable to do much, giving Vidal and Pereyra the chance to double team them. His method of keeping possession and playing simple passes meant he was hardly ever harried. Against DORTMUND. AT HOME. Pirlo-esque. Some of his turns and through balls had the genius of the bearded wonder written all over them. What a performance!
3) Almost the Vidal of old. Less of an attacking threat, but what a monster while defending! His rashness worried me a little, but he did well to reign it in. Hope this marks a turning point for him! Pereyra was AWESOME too. His close control and dribbling are actually the best in the entire team. While facing a high line, he is such an asset! He can definitely improve his finishing, but what a great team player to have!
4) Special mentions to Chiellini, Barzagli and especially Bonucci. King Kong was his old awesome dominant self today, Barzagli back to his imperious calm best. But special praise for the person I think has been leading the team on the pitch the most with Marchisio this term, Bonucci. What a ROCK! Didn’t give an inch of room and not the slightest hint of a mistake over the 180 minutes. World class performance from him!
5) Evra is winning me over. Another brilliant performance. And while he didn’t get to fire many crosses in, he ended up getting a lot of passes and making a lot of forward plays on the left wing. Lichtsteiner was his typically combative defensive self. He doesn’t have Cacaeres’ speed or crossing ability, but he makes you feel so safe!
6) Morata is the real deal. His composure and decision making in the final third needs improvement, but there’s every sign that he can make the jump into real quality. His touches, grinta, control, dribbling, passing, link-up play with Tevez and work-rate were all World class today! The no.9 we’ve sorely lacked for years!! Also, small note. 11 goals for him now. For a youngster who came for a big fee, got injured on his first day, and couldn’t get a start for 6 months, not bad at all! Here’s hoping he pushes on towards 20 for the whole season!
7) Tevez is THE MAN. What a player!! He has clear pro’s and con’s, but on nights like tonight, he’s perfect. His ability to break away and just make things happen is other worldly. 2 brilliant goals and a wonderful assist to silence the Dortmund faithful (an achievement in itself).. What more can we ask? Responded to his European goal drought last year with 6 goals so far!! Let’s hope for many more! FORZA APACHE!
8) What a great moment to be a Juventus fan!! On our day we can beat any one!! There may be many stronger teams, but few teams have the depth and tactical flexibility we have. Add to that the mentality, composure and experience of Buffon, Barzagli, Pirlo, Evra and Tevez, with the youth and skill of Morata, Pogba, Pereyra, and to the tactical GENIUS of Marchisio.. We have a team of champions! With experience. This might be the chance to really make the world sit up and take notice! Where’s the sbnation clown who said Juventus were average at best and had no chance against Dortmund? Yeah.. SUCK IT.
Forza Juveeeeeee!!! Fina Alla Fine!! Quarter finals, BRING IT ON!

That has to be the biggest sign of a well coached team. Many props to Allegri. He has earned respect and the accolades he gets for this win.
This win has to be great for morale and confidence going forward. A couple of years ago we thrashed Chelsea 3-0 at home. But this was in front of the vaunted ""Yellow Wall.""

I want to highlight in particular Evra and Pereyra, because at the start of the season I was sceptical of both of them (I guess like the majority of you), but for weeks now they have absolutely impressed me. You just have to look at Roma how Cole worked out for them and compare it to Evra’s situation at Juve :-). And regarding Pereyra: I really hope his buy-out clause is obligatory, because as mentioned in the other thread: If he improves his finishing, he would be absolutely outstanding. And if not, he is still a steel of a backup for either Vidal or Pogba.
By the way, I’ve watched the game in German TV. The German commentators were also hugely impressed by Juve, in particular by the defensive work and the fast and smooth switch from defensive to attacking play. They claimed that yesterday there was such a huge difference in class between both sides.

I think last night it has proven to be a very viable option. Not for every game or every situation, but definitely viable. After all, it’s not about the module, it’s about how you play it. 3-5-2 seems lackluster when seen in campionato against Sassuolo or Palermo, but you don’t play against Sassuolo and Palermo the way we played last night. It would be no fun. We would be like the highschool bully picking on the little chimp with the glasses. Totally not cool.
Anyway, stellar performance all around. Even Vidal and Pereyra, who I haven’t really liked most of the season. Marchisio was amazing, and if you don’t see him praised more it’s only because his game is not visually spectacular, but his performance was in no way inferior to Tevez’s (still, Tevez MOTM for me, in the second half he would start running and you could feel the panic in Borussia defense).

Juventus 3-0 Borussia Dortmund: EuroJuve seals spot in Champions League quarterfinals,danpchavez,"Mar 18, 2015, 11:34pm PDT",3-5-2,"I think the difference with the 3-5-2 last night was a) Dortmund weren’t sitting back, as people have mentioned (quite the contrary in fact), but also b) no Pirlo.
The maestro is great, but he’s not mobile enough for the 3-5-2 and it means that one of the other MVPP has to be watching his back the whole time, unless he goes super deep, which he often does, and then the gap from mid to attack is too big, because in 3-5-2 there’s not treq or extra attacker. With Pereyra or Pogba in the mid in a 3-5-2 we have the ability to break and dribble from defence with real pace, and with Marchisio at regista they can really gun it and take a risk. With Pirlo behind them in the 3-5-2 they can’t. And there’s often nobody for Pirlo to hit with a great pass in it (fewer ‘attackers’).
Marchisio-Pereyra-Vidal made 3-5-2 work well I think – pace on the break, craft and tactical awareness and bull-in-a-china-shop energy. Pogba would work too, but less well than Pereyra whose special power is those crazy 30 yard dribbles (crucial difference with Pogba’s dribbles is they tend to be more artful but less direct, hopefully he can learn the effectiveness of Roberto’s way sometimes).
This from someone who generally hates 3-5-2, but we were better after we got used to the switch last night (granted Tevez’s golazo gave us a hand).",Harry Lancaster ,"Mar 19, 2015 ", 3:42 AM,

I like a club to have stability and to get stability a manager needs time to implement his regime. I can honestly with my hand on my heart say that i am completly behind Allegri and like what he is trying to do. Bear in mind we havent seen HIS signings yet or who he wants to sign he has time to improve further and i think he will. Conte had his cycle and reached his limits i think with Juve now its Allegris turn. Who knows Allegri might suddenly leave pointing towards not having the energy anymore or whatever, but i would not want him to be fired, he has not done anything wrong so far. As we experienced last summer anything can happen, rash decisions can be made whether good or bad.

Interesting on the co-efficient front. Currrent standings for Serie A and EPL (no more teams left in competitions) are:-

England = 13.571
Italy has already clawed back 2.595 points from next year’s 3rd placed England and of course has another 6 games to go at a minimum. Another 2 seasons like this for Italy and England and the 4th Champions League spot is in the bag for the 2017-18 season.

Then the ""random"" draw will pit Juve vs PSG in the semi final to which Platini has a tough decision to make, either he chooses to help Juve a team he is adored by or a team from a country he is beloved in. A tough decision he decides to let the first game go fairly to which he gets upset by the PSG behaviour on field and intervenes in the second leg and decides Juve should go through to final because they have a better chance at keeping Real Madrid to a clean sheet due to return of the STINGY ITALIAN DEFENDING and because of his sheer disdain for Ronaldo to win Champions league twice in a row he allocates Mr. Webb to be the ref for the final in Berlin, with instructions to wave every foul on Ronaldo and to give every foul for any altercation of any Real players vs Lichtsteiner. An inconspicuous penalty shall be awarded to Juve in 92nd min of normal time with the score at 1-1, for Casillas roughly taking down Morata for trying to score vs his home club. Juve will win the Champions League with none of the above mentioned until the yearly European competition money is distributed and The anonymous Massimo Moratti finds out Inter got a paltry €20 while Juve gets €100 and multiple sponsorships from Asia, Europe, America and even the Antarctica.

By my calculations and previous winners’ points, the total club coefficient points earned by the two eventual winners would be approximately 22 which translates to another 3.66 country coefficient to be added to the 2.595 already clawed back from England – Total of approx 6.25 points.
Next year, the 2011/12 season points are dropped (5 year period) whereby England lose 15.25 and Italy loses 11.357. So in addition to the 6.25 points, Italy gains on England another 3.893 points – total of 10.143 points clawed back in an 12 month period. Not bad.
So a double win would mean that at the beginning of next season, Italy would only be behind England by 2.27 coefficient points. All Serie A has to do is earn that much more than England in the 2015-16 season and the 2016-17 season would start with 4 Italian teams in the CL.

Juventus 3 - Borussia Dortmund 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 3:40pm PDT",,"Loved how Allegri had Juve set up!
In 180 minutes ""Ze Germans"" weren’t allowed a sniff at our goal, barring that slip from ""our"" Slippy G. He must be the most relieved one with Juve advanced into the quarterfinals.
Tevez’s screamer, probably knocked the stuffing out of everyone in the ""so-called"" yellow wall of Dortmund we have been hearing about. Although Juve never cared about it, given that we have never lost away to Dortmund anyway.
Morata, an absolute workhorse, but he’s got to work on his finishing. They can be better.
After Pogba’s injury and the sudden reversion to 5-3-2 with Barzagli’s introduction, the team looked confused somewhat until the break.
Again all props go to Allegri for singing it into their ears that Pogba’s gone, and they’ve got to get focus back on and get their position on the field right. But it didn’t stop there, What I loved the most was how Juve players covered for each other, at different positions.
When you talk about covering your team-mate one name is synonymous with that concept. Marchisio, I am not sure I can name my son Marchisio, but I’ll definitely have no qualm considering Claudio as one option.
I saw glimpses of the old vidal. Hard working battling all game long. I’ve missed this Vidal for a long time now. Now King Arturo add a few goals to that performance and that’ll be the perfect treat to our eyes.
Pereyra, I don’t know how much it’ll cost Juve to get a finishing trainer specifically for him. If he gets his finishing improved, he can turn into an outstanding player. He was a menace tonight
And if you watch a Juve performance like this one and don’t send some love Bonucci and Chiellini’s way, then you’re committing sin. However I loved seeing Barzagli back at it, along with his two other favourite partners, and make some of the best attackers of the game look simply ordinary.

Juventus 3 - Borussia Dortmund 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 3:40pm PDT",More random observations,"- Marchisio displayed a textbook performance on how to play ""safety"" in football: closing spaces between offensive midfielders and offensive strikers – roaming left or right covering the on ball rushing Vidal/Pogba, cutting any pass trajectories. Moreover, well balanced passing, fast and smooth transition from defending mode to attacking mode. Not that he deals bad passes, but while his passing range is not of Pirlo’s class, he makes up for it with his smart tactical positioning, interceptions and tackles. I feel more secure when Marchisio is sitting in front of the DEF as opposed to Pirlo.
- Marchisio dealt with Mkhitaryan like he was an amateur. He’s a good playmaker when he’s got space in front of him, but when the going gets tough he gets mentally tired and starts trying anything and everything, making all the wrong decisions. For the people saying we need to sign him, I urge you to take another look at both his outings against us and to reconsider. I’m not sure this is the type of CAM Juve needs. Someone like Sneijder is much more suitable IMO.
- Reus was completely taken out of the game, but it was collective work from mainly Marchisio whenever Reus drifted to the center and either Licht and/or Vidal when Reus was roaming on our right flank.
- Evra had a solid solid game – oozing with experience. Lichtsteiner was his usual giddy self bombing up and down that right flank, taking care of Schmelzer, though he had a tough time pushing Schmelzer back the first 15min or so.
- Bonucci is a top world-class CB HNIC BOSS. Bonucci > Hummels.
- Vidal had a good game, breaking up a ton of Dortmund plays and making a nuisance of himself around their players, giving them less time for first-touch, control, looking up. Amazing classic #6 work. I think Vidal can play one of the two CMs in a 442 without breaking a sweat. Still, this is not the Vidal we know, there must be more to come from him, no?
- Pereyra had a good game. His speed bursts from MID to the last third were VITAL today. He’s the kind of player Conte desperately needed. I still don’t like him and he still hasn’t convinced me, but tonight he delivered. I guess if he leaves the shooting-on-target to the strikers, he’d be fine.",amirnyc ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 4:44 PM,

This triumph over two legs can spur us on to defeat la Viola in the Coppa 2nd leg and not only give us a huge boost in Europe this season, but in seasons to come.
All our players looked great playing in their best positions, (Vidal, Marchisio, Pereyra).
Many people here including myself have been doubting pereyra at times this season but he was outstanding tonight and helped link defensive play with our attacks. If he can improve his finishing for next year he will be spectacular and a snip considering he had great tactical discipline tonight alongside Vidal and Marchisio.

with Vidal – a player with better defensive awareness and box-to-box instinct than Pereyra, in that scenario he would just cover somewhere else or make penetrating run into the opposition box. however, point still stands that Arturo is also ineffective as (classic) TQ, simply because he’s not a creator in my opinion",hant00 ,"Mar 19, 2015 ", 3:36 AM,

I know alot of managers who would have just played for a 0-0 draw. But we went there to win. He set up the team perfectly and the players played the game perfectly.
This was by far and away the best Juventus match i have watched an have had the pleasure of watching since the days where our number 10 shirt was on the shoulders of our beloved ADP, when the number 11 shirt was adorned by Nedved, where the number 17 shirt was worn by Trezeguet. Im very happy with the performance and any one of the teams left in the cup would be threatened by that performance. We nullified BVB biggest threat, their pace with traditional Italian defending.

Either this, or Licht stays on and Padoin comes on for one of the CMs if they get tired.
Perhaps a Coman cameo for Morata late in the game, or maybe, since I feel Coman won’t be seeing UCL minutes, so Llorente for Morata late on.",amirnyc ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 7:02 AM,

"Juventus vs. Borussia Dortmund, Leg 2: You choose Max Allegri's starting lineup",Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 4:35am PDT",Berardi,"There has been alot of talk of how he is a Como or worst but if the deal involving Zaza is true then it must be one of the stupidest things done by this management. firstly Berardi has a way higher potential than Zaza and is a better all-rounded player and even greater the Camo comparison is just ridiculous where was Camo at 18-19 years old. Yes i have to admit his development has stagnated a bit but only cuz he is not more recognized and respected and thus not afforded the space of last season, and yet he has been able to continue delivering top preformances. It has been said Moratta and Zaza agent are buddies, this is more likely the cause behind this move. I totally would even prefer selling Zaza over Gabba because he is more versatile, mobile, skillful, creative and a better left foot. This Zaza move suck for both Berardi and Gabba two players who have demonstrated they are better suited for what Juve is, dont misunderstand what i am saying but he is definitely not better than those two and should not of been brought back b4 either got a chance. bad move Juve",juvetrini ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 7:16 AM,
"Juventus vs. Borussia Dortmund, Leg 2: You choose Max Allegri's starting lineup",Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 4:35am PDT",,"I’d say relax man. The two players are NOTHING alike, and their roles for Sassuolo and potentially Juventus are staggeringly different. With Morata now firing and Llorente drawing blanks (and commanding a large wage bill) It’s my guess that the plan is to ship him back out to Spain and bring in Zaza. He’s 22, the same age as Morata, is Italian and seems like a real fighter. He also seems able to score the odd goal out of nowhere, similar to Quags, which is a very useful trait. His link-up play is significantly better though. Berardi on the other hand is an inverted right winger. He’s fast, is a good dribbler, and while not exactly a flair or fantasia kind of player, he makes things tick. He creates for his team-mates and is a good finisher himself. I just think that the way Sassuolo’s attack has been lauded has also meant teams are a lot more careful against them. Without the backing of a quality midfield, I don’t see him growing any more at that team. Either way, I’m all for bringing him in this summer. But the move to finalize Zaza’s transfer doesn’t tell us anything about Berardi, so don’t jump to conclusions. If Allegri is still the coach, he knows what direction forward to take. While Tevez is still here, I say playing a X-mas tree formation with Berardi and Tevez behind Morata is aces. When a wide player plays instead of Tevez, it should easily be able to transition into a 4-3-3. If they want him, they’ll get him.
I’d take Berardi over Pereyra any day. And don’t even mention the Vidal at TQ option….",Kaushik_10 ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 7:41 AM,

Good analysis on teams respecting them, a point i noted
True Berardi needs to move on/up
My rant is based on the fact they seemed to purchase Zaza over/b4 Berardi also there is talk we are seriously looking at Dybala which would be a better move than Zaza at the moment, but also at whose expense does this Dybala move materialize. Initially when the news broke of our serious interest in Dybala I thought we were no longer going to purchase Zaza or is it we final saved up enough monies to make several large purchases at one Dybala, Zaza, Beradi all in the summer. And for the record I do like zaza, i just think players like Berardi and even Gabba should be out priority over pure strikers/PP like Zaza. My wish( fantasy) would of been Berardi, Dybala, Anderson.",juvetrini ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 8:15 AM,
"Juventus vs. Borussia Dortmund, Leg 2: You choose Max Allegri's starting lineup",Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 4:35am PDT",,The decision probably was also taken based on financial matters. The Zaza buyback clause stipulates 15 million euros if bought before 30th June 2015. It would rise to 18 million the year after. Marotta would not spend 3 million extra if he can help it.,Fefu ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 8:32 AM,
"Juventus vs. Borussia Dortmund, Leg 2: You choose Max Allegri's starting lineup",Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 4:35am PDT",,"I would rather us prioritize getting someone like Berardi over Zaza too, but all I’m saying is that it goes well to not count your eggs before they hatch. :) A LOT of reports suggested Conte tried hard to convince Berardi to return last summer, and with a legend/director like Nedved going out and saying that he is the future of this team.. Clearly he falls in the plans of the management. They’re probably waiting for the season to finish, and for us to have a clearer idea of what next season will be like. Remember, had Allegri been given more time at the club, he would have asked for transfers to facilitate the 4-3-1-2 a lot earlier. That way we wouldn’t be stuck seeing Vidal as a shadow of himself playing TQ. I think he’s ready to return this coming summer itself. I’m sure many at the club would agree with that. Worst case scenario, we buy out his contract fully (And we will. For sure. Co-ownership ends this summer, and we have an agreement to buy out their half of Berardi for 15 mill.) and send him out on loan. But with Coman probably going out on loan next year, I’d guess bringing Berardi in is looking quite likely, irrespective of the Zaza scenario. Maybe Llorente’s plight has pushed them into considering selling him, and I think we have a more than able understudy to Morata in Zaza.",Kaushik_10 ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 10:10 AM,
"Juventus vs. Borussia Dortmund, Leg 2: You choose Max Allegri's starting lineup",Danny Penza,"Mar 18, 2015, 4:35am PDT",,"I would be doubtful about what the newspapers are saying. I think Juve want Zaza, that talk has been around for a while and as someone said earlier, Juventus will want to save some money. The agreement in place is with the player, not the club… who knows, the agreement between Berardi and Juventus may have been in place for longer.
Remember that Berardi is currently owned by Juventus whereas Zaza is owned by Sassuolo.
I think at the end of the day, Juventus will pay 15m for Zaza and some money + Coman for Berardi (with a buyback option in the future). Less than 30m altogether.
As for Dybala, I don’t buy it one bit. When Premier League clubs and PSG are involved, we already know the story. Dybala to Juventus for 25m will be on the papers for weeks. Then, an English club or PSG will offer 35m and kick us out of contention. That kid is as good as gone.",JRob ,"Mar 18, 2015 ", 10:30 AM,

We have to defend, we have to hit them on the counter, we have to keep possession, we have to dominate and goddamnit we can
Borussia won 3-0 against Shalke oooh no they’re so good Shalke defeated Madrid in Madrid oh no. Please all their 3 goals were pathetic defending and if I am not mistaken scored in ridiculous 10 minutes of football.
I am not worried at all, but it all depends on the look on our teams faces. If we look worried, we should be worried. We are the better team, I wouldn’t be worried if the score in the first leg was 1-1. We are miles ahead of Dortmund.

Maybe it was because I just saw episode 5 of season 3 of House of Cards (very emotional episode IMO) or for other reasons, but I just couldn’t feel jubilant at the result. I felt profoundly sad at seeing Roma seem hopeless, soulless, defeated, jeered by their own fans (disgracefully, mind you), given up, and, to round it all off, see their captain (at the time) Keita self-destruct in pathetic fashion.
To see a captain abandon his team like that and then, bafflingly, fail to hurry out of the field (despite his teammates telling him to get away already) so as to give his team time to maybe launch a comeback, to just stand there and disregard the pleas of his teammates, it just wrapped it all up for me. I left the TV on but I walked away from the screen because I just felt so sad about it. Why? A team that was so strong, a team that pushed us to be our very very utmost best (last year, by breaking the points record) fall apart like this; because of the way I am, I just cannot celebrate that.
So what now? Well, 14pts, Scudetto wrapped up, and for a 2nd year in a row we’ll win a Scudetto with a double-digit cushion. Is this good for us? Obviously, 4 Scudetti is great (I mean, we’re obviously the best in the country by far, and always will be). But I just feel that this will aggravate the stereotype of ""Juve are great in a shitty/easy league, but shitty in a league of Champions (CL)"". There will be more talk and pressure about how our achievements in Italy mean little due to our shortcomings in Europe. The pressure will build. Deep inside, anger, fear, and doubt might begin to creep into the players’ heads? ""Is it gonna be the same ol’ empty, hollow year of winning a league title and nothing else?"" I guarantee you that every CL game this pressure and anxiety will creep into their minds. It will either hurt them or push them to become better, faster, greater.
Some pressure can be poisonous, other pressure can push people to their very best. Which pressure will be conceived in our players’ minds?

Serves Roma right to do so poorly as of ate, the entire organization has been making bold claims and taking cheep and unjustified shots at Juve rather than focusing on it’s own numerous shortcomings.
The situation might not depict the ideal image of Serie A, but that’s not my problem. That’s Roma’s fault and Roma’s alone to fix. Maybe this season will humble them, especially if they fall to third. You shouldn’t feel sad Chuks, nor should you have to necessarily laugh at Roma’s expense, although their karma is rather comical. All this goes to show is how far Juve has come from the mire of relegation after that giant farce. Juve was humbled, albeit unjustly so, and worked it’s way up from the ashes through smart planning, perseverance, and a strong professional mentality. Admittedly, there were numerous roadblocks and slumps along the way, but we got here as professionals and with a team spirit and identity in tact, not through arrogance, envy, and delusions of grandeur.
If Roma is as good as many make out to be, then it shouldn’t be dropping points so easily. The club needs a reality check and, assuredly, a new manager. Am I upset? Nope. I think I’ll enjoy this 14 pt lead atop the standings and a fourth consecutive league title with CL football still to play under the leadership of a so-called ""incompetent"" or ""below average"" coach of ours. Even without the best coach, we’re still winning, which says a lot about the pedigree of the club and the way in which it is managed. I like that.

The Roma of last season could pressure us to the very end, that’s because they’re humble enough to acknowledge that they just started a new project and working towards a long term goal, they recognized ""the other driver"", Conte, has a very strong car, that is Juventus, so they just fly behind our shadow and kept it low profile, up until the rest of the drivers saw them. This Seasons Roma however is cocky and arrogant, they have pretty much the same team but thought that they could took the early lead, underestimating Juventus just because Allegri is our new driver.
All I can say is I agree with Nuncio, that it serves them right to do so poorly, and personally I would say ""Fuck Roma!"", their fans celebrated our relegation way worse than Merdanisti themselves, they have all the chance to own Serie A while we were ""away"", but they’re just mediocre, THAT mediocre, as always… and will always be.

Really though? This same board has routinely sold their best players each window and replaced them with inadequate forwards and defenders not ready to be relied on. Benatia, Destro, Marquinhos, Lamela – all were top performers for Roma and they have been replaced by the likes of Astori, Doumbia, Yanga-Mbiwa and [insert dramatically unprepared 19 y/o here].
I think Roma’s failings are an institutional one – problems rest at the core of their board and trickle down from here. The decision to rely on and not phase away from Totti-dipendenza is an institutional one; the decision to buy Benatia and flip him one season later is an institutional one; deciding to give Garcia the leeway to be as brash and loud as he wants with the media is an institutional one.
I will say that I find the lack of self-belief at Roma hilarious – Roma had her best season ever last year, going toe-to-toe with [statistically, speaking] the best Serie A team ever. And this year? When they are close enough to get a whiff of the scudetto again and can really push Juve when/if she falters? They crumble and can’t beat bottom feeders like Chievo at home.

Juventus rule out injured Andrea Pirlo for trip to Borussia Dortmund,Danny Penza,"Mar 16, 2015, 1:20pm PDT",FYI ICYMI,"Sabatini is in charge of Romas transfer market, he made few good buys and also several questionable signings like those you mentioned, but selling Benatia was one of his best move. Roma sold Benatia because he wanted a De Rossi-wage-like just after his first season with them, Roma refused him and so he was not happy, to an extent that he’s whoring to the media that he wanted to move to a bigger club, I think any forward thinking director wouldn’t want to keep an unhappy player, plus his direct replacement, Manolas, the one you failed to mention, is a fucking stud, a world class CB in the making IMO.
Also I don’t believe that the board allowed their employees to be loud on the media, I remember back in 2011/12, one of their calls was to never criticise the refs, an easy thing for Luis Enrique, but a hard thing for Zdenek Zeman, who then got sacked by the management.
Maybe Pallotta did a mistake when he bought a loser club that is Roma, but he’s still a smart and classy dude with good ideas nonetheless, and actually Juve and Roma are not much of a rival off the pitch, Agnelli and Pallotta has pretty much similar ideas on Calcio reform, also that Stadio de la Roma is going to be a magnificent one, thanks to none other than Pallotta.",Linez ,"Mar 17, 2015 ", 8:23 PM,

Juventus rule out injured Andrea Pirlo for trip to Borussia Dortmund,Danny Penza,"Mar 16, 2015, 1:20pm PDT",Here's my take:,"Tactics > Personnel
A backline with Bonucci, Barzagli & Chiellini is beyond solid. I think Allegri likes the idea which is why he’s thinking about 3-5-2. But we can’t go into Dortmund trying to defend a 2-1 lead that could be gone in seconds. It just never works out this way. Allegri can’t let the fact that our best three central defenders are back change our intentions for this match. We simply must attack, and we simply must score goals. If Barza needs to sit this out then so be it.
The 4-3-1-2 has proven much more effective in attack than the 3-5-2. Lichtsteiner and Evra are not NEARLY dangerous enough offensively as wingbacks to make the 3-5-2 a good option. We’ve seen them contribute close to nothing in the final third time and time again. With Marchisio in front of the CB’s we’ll be solid as a rock in our half. Vidal in the midfield will also be a big boost. I’m not too worried about our defense, except on set pieces. Don’t forget we completely shut them down in the 1st leg. Now I’m not saying we should play an open game where anything goes, but we at least need to be a threat going forward. Leave the 3rd CB on the bench and let Pereyra run at that weak defense. If we play 352 we will without a doubt struggle to create chances and we just can’t have that happen.",algrafics ,"Mar 16, 2015 ", 10:39 PM,

Juve has it in spades in its DNA. I don’t recall ever anyone representing Juve say ""we’ll win the Scudetto"" as early into season as everyone from Roma did.
Even today, Gigi was asked if scudetto’s won? And his response was ""Well, 14 point lead is a lot"".
The same way, Juve never declares winning a game before it’s played out even against the weakest provincial opponent. They’re always classy and tactful about it. The respect you afford your opponent, no matter their status and position in the league table, actually helps you keep grounded. Also if you do talk big game and fail to produce it, it will demoralize the hell out of you. And that’s exactly what happened to Roma.
What Roma’s going through now is their own doing.
Examples?
Here’s Gigi on Durtmond:

""I think Borussia are one of the five or six best teams in Europe, so the fact that we played an even game with them, and in some instances were even better is a good sign.
""That said, we must do it again and confirm these things tomorrow.""

I always reference this Edgar Davids quote because I find it particularly expressive of this culture: ""In Juventus I have learned how to win. I don’t know how it happened, but there is in the air you breathe in the locker room, it is a concept that goes from player to player, it’s the emotion millions of fans will give you and there is no other club that gives you the same effect.""

- Significantly weakened defense with the Benatia sale and the Castan injury.
- Strootman injury – Roma started to decline even last season once Strootman was ruled out by injury
- Totti is older by a year. No matter how much Romanisti love him, it is suicide to play a false 9 with 2 fast wide attacking wingers who cross into the box with no one inside to connect.
- Africa Cup. We know how Asamoah returned back a shadow of himself from that competition 2 years ago. One must note Sabatini’s idiocy in buying Doumbia just after the Africa Cup.
- Garcia being caught out as a 1 trick (read tactic) pony. Conte showed the way to beat Roma last year by dropping deep and denying space to Roma’s pacy wingers. Obvious move when you think about it. The rest was history mainly because Garcia is incapable/unwilling or worse not allowed to adjust tactics.
I do not have sympathies for Roma but I do believe they played a good season last year. A season that might have won them a scudetto were it not for a record breaking Juventus.

Not necessarily b/c 352 is so awful (it has its useful sides, they’re just different than when Conte used it) but because of game/strategy management.
If we start with our usual 4-3-1-2, which, IMO, has proven to be a very balanced offensive-defensive formation, then we can simply try to reach the hour mark or so level at 0-0 and then switch to 3-5-2. Why? It’s much easier to switch from a balanced offensive-defensive formation to a (quite) defensive strategy/formation than vice-versa. Imagine if we start with 3-5-2 and concede a goal before the hour mark. Then we have to switch our entire mentality (and probably formation, thus wasting a substitution) to chase the game. Dortmund then don’t have to chase the game anymore and will sit back, and we’ll be vulnerable to their ever-so-dangerous counter attacks.
At least if we concede while playing 4-3-1-2 we don’t have to tinker too much (both strategically, mentally, and formation-wise) to move towards a more offensive game.

Whatever it takes.,"This is not the same impotent 3-5-2 we saw vs Bayern two seasons ago. In addition, BvB are not Bayern either. Not even close. From a tactical perspective, starting Barzagli in a back three is a No-Brainer. The object is to go through, and so long as they don’t concede, they will progress. In either shape, (3-5-2, 4-3-1-2) Juve have plenty of scoring quality and I believe they will get that away goal at some point regardless of their approach. With Marchisio patrolling the bowels and work rate of the Juventus wingers, this shape will create matchup problems for BvB all over the pitch… at the back, on the wings, up the middle. Considering Dortmund need goals, there will certainly be opportunities to counter-strike. With the individual quality up top and in the mid, it makes perfect sense to deploy the strongest back end possible and this is it. Juve will go through.",ADP1996 ,"Mar 16, 2015 ", 7:25 AM,

It’s no secret that the 3-5-2 can be exposed against a team with strong wingers, that’s why Conte switched to a back 4 when playing against Real Madrid.
I agree our defense stands the best chance with Barzagli in the back and that we will get an away goal at some point. Between Tevez and Morata they will surely cause some unrest on BvB’s defense.
But to come to Westfalenstadion and ask for a clean sheet is a big task. BvB with their backs against the wall will come out with loaded guns and my guess is they’ll put one away. But hey, as long as Juve progress I’ll take any result.

They are missing Lewandowski badly and their mentality is weak if we survive their first 10 mins which i predict will be crazy and get a goal by the first 30mins i believe they will implode or at least give up.
I doubt Allegri will play 352 A) he said Barza was tired after palermo as he isnt fully fit yet and B) he wont be able to play pereyra meaning no direct running/creativity and only tevez and morata up top which is bad imo.
Even if we play 352 I m not afraid of winger over load as this isnt the first time we are going to face tht situation and this isnt conte’s 352.

1- it ll limit the effect of their midfielders cutting inside (Reus is deadly when he does that) providing an extra man to close these runs
2- with Bonucci in a good day, that s an extra playmaker we have
3- Tevez can come back a bit and be the false trequartista when we have the ball

a) the stadiums that were built for the 2006 world cup, better footballing system…
b) in 18 team system, it means each team will get more money. ( divided by 18 instead of 20, easy math)
c) Less condensed league schedule will allow teams that participate in europe to better prepare which resulted in German teams making deeper runs in the european competitions and that in turn means more money for the clubs participating in those european competitions.
d) Global image. No matter how great your marketing strategy is, in terms of selling the club globally, if you’re not making deeper runs in the european competitions, people outside Italy will just turn away from Italian teams. . I remember times when not many knew who the hell Bayern was, when Juve, Inter and Ac Milan were clubs discussed by even those who cared little about Football.

When does he crack under pressure?
How about Torino 94th min winner in the derby, Fiorentina late free kick away to win Europa League tie last year, calm assist to Grosso in extra time WC 06, great game under heavy pressure from Celtic defender in Rnd 16 CL 2013.
He’s always been slower and always arrogant on the ball and loses it sometimes in awkward positions.
But Evra Bonucci Chiellini and even Licht have cost us just as much this year of their own accord. Maybe Pirlo has cost us two or three times max. No less than these other guys.
Yes maybe this means he’s not right v BVB as I keep saying. But it’s a long stretch to go to the other extreme and say we shouldn’t even have him on board like someone else said. We’d be lost without him. And yes we should be developing play/tactics which don’t rely on him (this is something Allegri should be working on) but there’s no need to throw the baby out with the bath water.
Every player has weaknesses. Licht crossing, Tevez passing/vision, Vidal attacking creativity, Bonucci lack of pace/toughness etc.
You have to weigh the player up as a whole.
Pirlo is like the opposite of Marchisio. Because Pirlo is pivotal his mistakes get amplified just like Marchisio’s good contributions get played down.
Pirlo is still without a doubt well above average in this team when you consider his pluses and minuses.
People over exaggerate how much he actually costs us on the counter and underestimate his defensive abilities.
I agree that we should rely on box to box warrior midfielders for certain games. But I don’t think that we need to artificially put down Pirlo to justify that. They’re just different types of players.
Pirlo still has great value.",Paolo C ,"Mar 15, 2015 ", 10:32 PM,
Juventus 1-0 Palermo: Álvaro Morata stunner seals Sicilian snoozefest,danpchavez,"Mar 14, 2015, 4:03pm PDT",Pirlo,"This Pirlo discussion is by no means undermining his value. But the fact is there are certain players that change the whole game and formation just by being on the pitch. Eg Tevez
If we are playing a 352 with Tevez as one of the strikers, we are much weaker in attack as compared to a 352 with much worse players such as Matri and say Bendtner. That is because Tevez wants the ball early and the midfielders have to stay behind Tevez till he runs forward. If you watch our unbeaten season Marchisio and Vidal used to overlap with Vucinic and Matri. But Tevez doesn’t work with 352, he just doesn’t.
There will always be a problem with such quality players. The exact opposite of quality is Padoin, and guess what you can play him any position without affecting the formation or game plan.
So when I say Pirlo needs to be phased out it is not because he is slow or no longer the same player etc. It is simply because he changes the formation. The 4312 with Pirlo is somewhat close to a 352. If you see the highlights of some games when we are attacking, We have Bonucci Pirlo and Chiellini at the back with the three midfielders and full backs making the midfield 5. Now the problem here is, if we are counter attacked in this situation you have a 35 year old Pirlo and two defenders against possibly 3 or 4 players. Not to mention the 1 in our 4312 essentially is just a cm instead of being the link to the attack. Because the link to our attack is all the way back with Bonucci and Chiellini.
4312 with Marchisio is a 4312. Pereyra or Vidal or whoever is the treq can be that. In fact when marchisio has played in the middle, while attacking we morph into a sort of 433 with Tevez on the left Morata in the middle and the treq on the right.
No one in their right mind can say Marchisio is better than Pirlo seriously. But it is about the formation and Allegri had the same problem with Pirlo in Milan.
In 2006 for Italy Pirlo had Gattuso, Camoranesi and Perotta (Padoin’s role model) in a 4411 with Totti or Del Piero up top with Toni or Gilardino. This worked because Camo would go up with the strikers and Perotta and Gatusso would just shield Pirlo. AND we had Grosso and Zambrotta for the attack.
What happens now. Marchisio and Vidal shield Pirlo. Vidal should go up but does not, instead Pogba does and he is not a winger neither is Vidal for that matter. I don’t want to talk about the full backs.
Finally what I want to say is, it is not about the who is better. It is about what works. And Pirlo in Europe with 4312 is not something that works. It is too easy to defend against. Take Pirlo out and everyone is clueless.
Anyway this is just my view, Pirlo is most likely to play against Dortmund and most likely to play well.",Fuzail ,"Mar 16, 2015 ", 12:42 AM,

Too often we play it like a 3-5-2.
But I said in a big post a couple of months ago that I suddenly realised Pirlo is not the problem, its our style of play.
In my opinion the answer is not necessarily to phase out Pirlo, although that’s one option.
We should / Pirlo should just play less as a deep lying playmaker when playing 4-3-1-2 and play a bit quicker with the ball and less slow tempo.
He’s done it some games so certainly capable of doing it eg Lazio 3-0 away and a couple of other games.

I think he is one of the calmest and most collected players on the team under any situation. He doesn’t panic when he gets pressed. He just lacks that extra spring in his step he used to have.
I think what people fail do see is that if you have opponents harass and press our other players, the result is very similar. Teams don’t just press Pirlo, they press the entire back line and mid, often causing us to play long balls or misplace passes.
Playing faster and more direct football shouldnt be confused with playing better football. Playing with or without Pirlo doesn’t necessary make us better in either way, it’s just a style change. Without him, it’s something new that many like to perceive is better because it’s fresh and different. When Pirlo plays, the tempo is usually slower, but do not forget that he can solely changed that in an instant. When the game appears to be in a deadlock, he can dissect a team with a killer pass or win a game with a single freekick or 30-yard screamer.
Without him, we are often bereft of ideas moving the ball forward. On the other hand, movement is more direct and fluid when it works. Passes are simpler and reconf the ball is quicker and and we are less machine-like in recycling the ball (ball doesn’t necessarily have to return to Marchisio a la Pirlo). The team certainly plays a lot faster with athletic players roaming the midfield, and although Pirlo’s defensive and tackling capabilities are criminaly underrated, the back four are better shielded with Marchisio in front of him because his ability in that role to read and shield the defensive line is superior to that of our other CMs. But what if we can’t score a goal and our opponents have 10 men behind the ball?
So are we truly better with or without Pirlo? One thing is certain though, this teams needs to adapt to playing without Pirlo, because all players retire eventually, and he is very close. To depend on such a player for success leaves the team lost all too often when he isn’t on the pitch. He is very useful and still one of our best players, but we need to adopt a new style so that when the sad day comes that Pirlo hangs them up, we will still be able to dominate in style.",Nuncio#7 ,"Mar 16, 2015 ", 5:35 AM,

He is a confident and young Italian talent who has been somewhat of a squad leader for a provincial side for 2 years now. That isn’t ‘nothing’.
My worries lie more with discipline issues, an inflated reputation as a goal-scorer thanks [largely] to being the team’s designated rigorista, and not being the type of decisive player that we see from a youngster like Alvaro so far. I don’t see Berardi as the key cog in Sassuolo’s attack and instead recognize that the impressive combination of Berardi, Zaza and Sansone (all three) give opposing team headaches. A lot of the highlight moments from Sassuolo games come from the three of them overwhelming opposing defenses on counters or exploiting space. The problem I see? You don’t get that ‘space’ when you are Juve – teams are well-drilled and conscientious about not relinquishing space.
While Berardi would no doubt be a ‘cheap’ and Italian solution to obtaining width and youth in a position where we need it – I am not sold quite yet. As mentioned above, I hope Im wrong.",dweb ,"Mar 16, 2015 ", 8:08 AM,

I’m not knocking Berardi for who he is and what talents he possesses. And I still think he will be a good addition to the team. But for the (limited) times I’ve seen him he doesn’t bring that magic that players like Camo bring and which, IMO, is the key missing ingredient for Juve.
Had an interesting thought while watching Barca the other day. If Jordi Alba can play as a FB in the CL, why couldn’t we convert Berardi to a FB? He is smart, fast, strong in the tackle, good crossing and link-up play. When you look at his skill set he seems to be a pretty ideal, modern FB.

To be honest I have never seen Volland play so I cannot really judge. I also agree that Berardi might not be ready for Juve and that is only if Allegri contemplates a 433 or a 4231 for next season. If he keeps up with the 352, 4321 and 4312 formations, Berardi is not needed – then again neither is Volland.
My post was mainly financial. If Volland is that good to get a 20 million value with another 2 years on contract, Juve can’t afford him since that 20 million is going to rise significantly. Berardi is cheaper and Marotta buys cheap when he can.

Juventus 1-0 Palermo: Álvaro Morata stunner seals Sicilian snoozefest,danpchavez,"Mar 14, 2015, 4:03pm PDT",,"Berardi has been off form since january, but this season he seemed (at least to me) more mature(playing wise not elbows n stuff), responsible and complete. He has been less flashy but he gets the stuff done and has learned to use his teammates more especially his partnership with Vrsaljko (who we r rumoured after plays RB/LB) has been wondeful. He tends to drop deeper and cut in/stay central to allow Vrsaljko to overlap.
On finding space to run and all, I dont see tht being a problem he has enuf trickery in him to create space for himself like hw pereyra and morata has been doing. I hv seen him many times using flicks to get past his opponents who are tightly marking him, he ends up running rings ard them. By seeing the impact pereyra has had, I feel it is no brainer to bring berardi who is much more talented and creative then pereyra is.
On whether he is ready for juve, he has been with sassuolo in seria A for two years i doubt they can help him more he needs imo a place in a team thts in europe. Personally i would bring him back especially considering the growth Morata has had under guidance of tevez, llorente, pirlo and other experienced players of the squad. Also next season will be last for tevez and pirlo at least not sure who else (pogba, barzagli), I believe they will gain alot more under the tutelage of tevez and pirlo then in some other team.
On his discipline, not really worried he losses his cool sometimes but even when pogba came he was like tht i remember him spitting at a player current examples morata tht can be edged out in this calm environment compared to the pressure cooker atmosphere when he along with zaza has to lead, his YCs tend to be due to rash striker challenge when tracking back tht also I believe he can learn hw to avoid/learn to tackle properly/will hv proper cover so he doesnt need to do stupid challenge.",SJ_JUVE ,"Mar 16, 2015 ", 10:32 AM,
