A fresh 27 year old matri or 30+ old van bommel and nesta. GET A LIFE TROOLLLLLLL. And Flamini is a horribly mediocre player. It’s not our fault that Cassano has a bad ticker.

Fiorentina 0-5 Juventus: Bianconeri Thrash Viola In Style #iBlameAmauri,ivoandov,"Mar 19, 2012, 2:40am PDT",,"on this game, all MVPs were on fire hence made us a very comfortable win.
in my opinion Vucinic deservers 8.5 since his shot at 6th went to the post and at second half he wasted delicious pass from Matri and scoffed it wide to the left instead of aiming it to the right, but it doesn’t really matters.
Matri was just unlucky not putting his name on the scoresheet.
Buffon was doing business as usual, keeping clean sheet LIKE A BOSS.
Caceres had a few brainfarts but lucky for us none of them were being capitalized.
Pepe was being the good Pepe, nothing more nothing less
Bonucci was excellent, De Ceglie was awesome, Licht was haunting Fiorentina’s left flanks with Pepe like nightmares.

- Goalkeeper : none
- Defender : Caceres(10mil) + Astori (Free) ;
sell Bonucci(15mil)
- Midfield : Montolivo (free) + Honda (15mil) + Estigarribia(500k) ;
sell Padoin (2mil) , Krasic (10mil) ,
- Strikers : Jovetic (30mil) + Ciro Immobile;
sell Del Piero (sadly not retiring in Juve), BorieLoL (send him back to Roma )
Total : 55.5mil- 25mi = 30 mil
Padoin won’t be sold soon but i don’t think he is good enough for the squad
I think if the Summer Mercato gives us these player we will be ready to improve on this season:
4-3-3:
-——————————————————-Buffon(Storari)—————————————————————
Licth(Caceres)—-Barzagli(Astori/Sorensen)-Chielini(Astori/Sorensen)—-Caceres(De Ceglie

-———Elia(Pepe)——————————————————————(Vucinic)Jovetic—-

Genoa 0:0 Juventus - An Improved Performance For Yet Another Draw,ivoandov,"Mar 13, 2012, 3:55am PDT",,"I would love to see Giovinco back if he can""Shut the Fuck up"". I would love to see him instead of Vucinic up front. Matri is a top player, he suffers a lot because of Vucinic, he doesn’t get as much balls as he should. Matri has the ability to be somewhere between Vieri, Inzaghi and Trezegol, if he gets right partnership he can be 30+ goals per season easily.
What about Barzagli? I want him to play champions league with us, starting CB. One of the most constant defenders in the world. He found his best (LIFE) form in his 30, i am guessing he will maintain his form util he is 33-35. Conte brought the best out of some players: Buffon, Barzagli, Pirlo, Chiellini last couple of months.
My wish for the next season:
Buffon
Lich – Barzagli – Chiellini – Kolarov/Aly cissokho
Pirlo
Vidal – Marchisio

That my friends is racism at its ugliest. By the way for people who don’t know calling an Albanian a Siptari is probably one of the worst insults possible to call someone that is of Albanian Heritage. It would be like calling a black person the N word. It would be like if a German made a comment about the Holocaust. Its kind of ironic that this Tito guy is a Inter
fan. Not only is he a prick he is also a moron because he doesn’t know that the club he supports has a history of not signing Italian players but mainly players from the Balkans and South America. I hope whoever owns the offside gets him banned.
We Albanians get enough hatred as it is but now we have to see their comments on the Internet as well. Truly pathetic basically ruined my day. Only a Juve win could cheer me up. FORZA JUEVNTUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",XhakaJuve ,"Mar 11, 2012 ", 5:40 AM,

One think we must sure – second half will be much different even harder for us so, if Conte is smart he will prepare some Elia kind of people on the counter attacks.
Giach disappeared late on the half – he started brightly, but then…
Anyway, I do believe we can manage to ein but only if we score first.If we concede than will be hard – Genoa are really dangerous.

Vucinic at least played better football than previous ones, just unlucky to hit 2 posts. Elia’s introduction was not better comparing to Pepe, but necessary Pepe he grew tired as minutes went on. and you can’t pretty much blame the dutch since he’s been playing less than 90 minutes of calcio so far and was out of position.
Buffon was being Buffon as usual, Vidal-Caceres partnerships was good, De Ceglie was decent but offensively was not an abomination comparing to the other flank with Pepe and Licht. But I understand he needed to back up the CB pairs.
Pirlo was being Pirlo, Marchisio went overrated Marchisio, and everything else for players I have no comments.

My point is the team played much better than the last 5 games where they got a draw. In those games we got the draw because they were dull in the final third, couldn’t create good chances to score. Yes, they dominated those matches but the only good chances from those match that I remember was Pirlo’s long range effort against Bologna. Tonight, it was different. They created plenty of good chances, and I remind you again, they did score a goal.
I’m not saying they were perfect. I’m also disappointed at this result, but I’m not as disappointed at their performance as I was in the last 5 draws.

POTD: Wanna Get Away?,Danny Penza,"Mar 7, 2012, 12:27pm PST","Frustrated with the result, and very bored, figured I'd take my mind off of it with some FANTACALCIO","The team obviously needs an injection of creativity. ADP will not be around to help next season, and Elia is still in cold storage. I think it’s entirely possible that we buy a young, dynamic, attacking player. We have been linked with a few already.
I’ve been bandying some names around in my head, and come up with a scale, ranging from affordable and possible to pure fantacalcio.
Who would you take from this list and why? (transfermarkt transfer value rough approximations listed).
1: Antoine Griezemann (20) ~8million euros
2: Sebastian Giovinco (25) not sure how much the other half would cost
3: Gaston Ramirez (21) 10 million euros
4: Iker Munain (19) 15 million euros
4: Jovetic: Cost: a lot, just signed a new contract and highly valued in Florence
5: Mario Gotze: Cost: even more, and we face more competition from other clubs for him than anyone on this list.
I see Ramirez or Giovinco being the most likely, but I actually would much rather have Muniain OR Griezmann than either of those two.",AKSupporter ,"Mar 8, 2012 ", 11:00 PM,
POTD: Wanna Get Away?,Danny Penza,"Mar 7, 2012, 12:27pm PST",,"Griezmann will be very good for 4-3-3. As much as i like Muniain i think he will benefit more to stay another year at Bilbao before making big money move, granted if Bilbao managed to secure last CL spot and getting some CL footy next season.
Jovetic i doubt we could land him, Gotze is even more impossible, Ramirez is last resort, Giovinco i don’t really like him with no reason whatsoever.",bebek ,"Mar 9, 2012 ", 5:49 AM,
