Five Juventus questions to be answered in 2016,JRob,"Jan 4, 2016, 3:00pm PST",happy new year everyone,"1. yes we could win the title again but our form and that of the other front runnners will be the important going forward.
2. At present i think that match is 50/50 right now so no real prediction there, ask me the day of the first leg. also i would like to point out the growth we have had under Max in Europe i think we might be able to go all the way if not this season then next , when we buy ISCO.
3. i think he stays till after the WC 2018.
4. if this were yesterday i would say @ juve as a striker for yesrs to come but with todays news of Rafs sacking i think he maybe heading back to madrid soon.
5. i hope he comes, there has been alot talk and reports claiming different things do i am a bit unsure of his final destination but really hope he arrives in Turin. Also there been alot of comments here of where he will play i believe Max see him as a SS.",juvetrini ,"Jan 4, 2016 ", 4:00 PM,

I took in Juve vs Milan at the San Siro last year in what would have been one of Inzaghi’s first games. He was pretty different on the bench from how he behaved as a player. On the bench, the only way to describe his behaviour is that of a total spaz. He would gesture wildly, constantly shouting at no one in particular, just a complete bundle of nerves.

Five Juventus questions to be answered in 2016,JRob,"Jan 4, 2016, 3:00pm PST",,"- We will win scudetto BUT i expect a slow january,Allegri works the players to ground during breaks so just like last season I am expecting a so-so january (not as bad as start of the season) and then bursting into form right before the BM game.
- Honestly it will depend on BM 1) how are they taking the pep exit, burst into form like they did under heckynes or lets just get over with this season and 2) how man of BM’s wingers stay fit. If its just Costa and Coman on wings and mueller as spport we shd be ok. Marchisio can help with mueller and sandro vs Costa will be fun and Licht can take care of Coman. Problem will arise if Robben or ESPECIALLY RIbery is fit than the right side will hv problem. Pogba vs Vidal will be fun to (i fully expec vidal to be asked to mark Pogba). Anyway it pans out its going to be very interesting match. Our squad has improved leaps and bounds since we last met them while they are pretty much the same or less. Also Allegri vs Pep again.
- As i noted in a long ass post in a few threads back I dont see Pogba leaving. BM wont spend that much money, Barcelona apprently dont hv that much money,PSG and City wont be his destination they are at the same level as us and Perez doesnt like his agent tho if Zidane turns out like conte instead of inzaghi he might request Pogba. He does like Pogba so that is very possible. He might leave in 2017 for Barcelona or City (if pep stables the ship by then) tho I also doubt that as before WC shifting to new club/country with different type of play might affect his position in WC. Most likely if he moves will be after WC 2018, but if we lose to BM this UCL and he ends up feeling like he cant win UCL here in next 2 or 3 seasons he might pack his bags and jump.
- It depends on whether morata can make the jump psychologically as out of Mandzukic, zaza and him, he is the most talented (i know diff style of play but he has more talent), He just need to get his psych straight then he can cement his place. If he cements his place and Zidane’s RM turns meh he will stay if not its 50-50
- He will arrive and will stay I am sure about it.

Five Juventus questions to be answered in 2016,JRob,"Jan 4, 2016, 3:00pm PST",,"1. yes- I think the title will be completely dependent on if we win it or not. We’re close enough that we don’t need a miracle or anything. If our forms stays good not great we will win it because everyone else in top will drop points along the way.
2. It’s a 40-60 Bayern imo right now. I think they’re a slightly better team, but not like we’re massive underdogs either. But I think form going into mid February and injuries will tell tale before a ball is kicked.
3. i think this all depends on the euros. If he has a James type euros like he did World Cup or even wins it with France. I don’t think he will stay especially if zidane is their talking in his ear and still manager for RM, along with benzema. No if he is so so or France crashes out. I think he will stay to prove he can try and win a cl with juve and be the guy.
4. i think it comes to play time and belief by the team. If he plays well and consistently he won’t wanna leave. If he keeps getting time like he has this season for whole year or next he’s gone.
5. i think he comes, I think he didn’t come earlier cuz of conte and allegri had no choice last year and berardi had already made a decision to stay. I think in a two striker system he is perfect cover for dybala as ss. And and any front three 4-3-1-2,4-3-3,4-3-2-1 he fits in somewhere in allegris plans.
6. This is just for me and cuz I’m really curious. Plus people will hate me all things aside aka cup status, money, and team. Currently played for.

He’s very tactically aware, a surprisingly tough tackler and above all else he’s one of the most imaginative players I’ve ever seen. My conditions for signing him would be that Allegri is coach and wants to play 4312 as his main formation. Don’t forget that the club have been asked to try and sign a high profile Brazilian in the next couple of years to help promote Fiat/Jeep in Brazil. Unless he has a great second half of the season, I reckon we could be looking at 25m plus bonuses if Chelsea sign Texeira. Anything under €30m would be a steal.

Five Juventus questions to be answered in 2016,JRob,"Jan 4, 2016, 3:00pm PST",,"I think he’s underrated as far as grinta is concerned and I’m sure he’s been limited by Mourinho. Jonathan Wilson was writing about Mourinho’s ‘philosophy’ last week. His golden rules for football are:
1) The game is won by the team who commits fewer errors.
2) Football favours whoever provokes more errors in the opposition.
3) Away from home, instead of trying to be superior to the opposition, it’s better to encourage their mistakes.
4) Whoever has the ball is more likely to make a mistake.
5) Whoever renounces possession reduces the possibility of making a mistake.
6) Whoever has the ball has fear.
7) Whoever does not have it is thereby stronger.
That’s not a recipe for getting the best out of creative players – he’s also highlighted how important defensive characteristics of trequartistas are for him.

Five Juventus questions to be answered in 2016,JRob,"Jan 4, 2016, 3:00pm PST",,"Both players are great, and would bring more diversity to the team. I am guessing you don’t want me to sit on the fence so I’ll pick Isco (if money was not an issue) for three reasons:
1) I prefer Isco as a player than Eriksen. His style of play is just so nice to watch. If you crunch the numbers for this season, Isco has been equally as effective as Eriksen, but you have to keep in mind that Isco has been out of favour with Rafa for a while now.
2) Isco knows what it is like to win and play in important matches. He plays for Spain and Real Madrid, Eriksen plays for Denmark and Tottenham; hardly the same. Isco knows what it is like to play every game with the expectation of winning, and his success is not that of a big fish in a small pond. For years now, Isco has been surrounded by champions. Some players burn out at Juventus because they can’t handle the pressure. Not saying that Eriksen will burn out, but the transition will be smoother and less risky for Isco.
3) As Juventus moves forward we need to sign players that will increase the brand. You can buy relatively unknown players and turn them into stars (Pogba, Bonucci, etc.) but that process takes a while and is less noticeable. Juventus spending a big sum in an already established player will certainly improve our brand. Imagine the headlines: Juventus buys Isco from Real Madrid for $60m vs. Juventus buys Eriksen for $45m from Tottenham. There is no denying the first will sell more papers and T-shirts and improve our overall business standing.",JRob ,"Jan 5, 2016 ", 8:33 AM,

2) To be realistic and honest, Bayern has the better chance. But it won’t be a 4-0 or 5-0 thrashing, it will be close, sorta like 4-3 or 3-2. Also, I wouldn’t be surprised if we won, there’s a chance for us to win, too.
3) Nope, Pogba isn’t leaving.
4) Morata… If he doesn’t get playing time this season, he might leave. I won’t be that mad, he’s talented and everything, but we can live without him. I mean his sale wouldn’t upset me as much as selling Dybala, Pogba or even Berardi.

In the summer, though, I would sell one of Mandzukic or Zaza (potentially both – if you can find a cheaper, comparable player). You’ve averaged something like running at a loss of €30m for the last three years, but I’d bump it closer to €50m, given there’s an outlier going into last season where you earned €12m (rather than losing more than €47m in the other two seasons). So let’s assume Berardi costs €25m and Fabinho costs €30m. That basically puts you at your €50m, but I’d still suggest adding a CM and a LW (for rotation, both of them). If you sell Zaza, you’ve got an extra €30m-ish to spend. Personally, I’d opt for someone like Youri Tielemans – a CM with the controlling abilities of a regista and some impressive mobility (along with loads of experience) – and a loan for El Shaawary.
I think ideally, the goal is to have personnel that can run a 4-3-3 or a 4-3-1-2 at any given moment, which means 5 CMs, 3 ST, a RW, and a rotation winger (right or left, I’d just prefer left given Morata would be new to the formation).

Darmian could also be an interesting option. Or De Sciglio. I know he’s been not-so-good on the left, but I still like him on the right a lot.

What should Juventus do with reported want-away striker Simone Zaza?,Danny Penza,"Jan 4, 2016, 5:00am PST",Well it's ideally to fund sales to create more fluidity.,"If you’re running a hybrid 4-3-1-2 (or 3-5-2)/4-3-3 system, you only need 3 CFs – and you’d need to bring in two wingers and a RB (at least, in my opinion there needs to be a new RB – with Licht aging and what not). The last few windows suggest that €50m is your general transfer budget, and anything you spend on top of that is funded through transfers – which would mean you’d almost certainly need to sell one of Mandzu/Zaza (given they’re not going to fit a 4-3-3 at all, and there’s no room for both in a 4-3-1-2) to get the players. I just think that Zaza produces €15m more for the team in his tenure than Mandzukic would in his (mostly because he’s younger, will probably stay around longer, and can increase his value).
If the goal is to keep running a 4-3-1-2 or 3-5-2 all the time, there’s no need to sell either – I just get the feeling that Max experimenting with a 4-3-3 and the rumors around Berardi suggest that he wants it to at least be an option, though).",semperty ,"Jan 4, 2016 ", 9:15 PM,

The fact that he came to Juventus and right off the bat asked the management for the #10 jersey, says a lot about his character no? So I repeat, unless he DEMANDS for a transfer… No. Whatever the offered price may be.

I don’t see why you’d get a CM who’s strength is really as a deep-lying playmaker, when you can go modern formation with a CAM or with two wingers for the 433. My point is, what’s the use of playing a 4312 without a fantasista in the hole? That defies the whole concept.
OK, so you maybe can replace Gundogan for Pirlo as a deep-lying, but you can’t get 4/4 tackles/interception each game from none of the other CMs on roster.

At that point, buying a CAM is a waste of money. You’ve bought someone for half a season that becomes almost incredibly useless within six months of being signed.
If you sign someone like a Gundogan, then you keep the 4-3-3 open long term while also giving the club a playmaker in the hole. That’s the point. Buying an out-and-out 10 is a great move if the only formation Allegri plans to use is a 4-3-1-2 (or a 4-2-3-1). But if he’s even remotely thought about a 4-3-3, the 10 gets wasted or is forced to play out of position.
In my eyes, it’s better to play one of Gundo/Pogba/Marchisio out of position from January to May, but in position from 2016 until they leave, than to play a new TQ in position from January to May but out of position until they leave. It puts this team in a similar position to last year’s team, but it sets the team up for a substantially brighter (near) future.

He always had to maintain width until the ball was in the final third, then he was given freedom to do whatever he wanted. He talked about one game where he wasn’t involved much, went looking for the ball on the other side of the pitch and ended up scoring – Guardiola took him off at half-time for disobeying instructions! It’s vital for an effective 433 that the forwards stay wide to stretch the defence until the fullbacks get forward.
Totally agree about Suarez, he makes that whole front line effective with his unselfish play – similar to Eto’o and Pedro, but possibly even better.",Il Gigante Buono ,"Jan 3, 2016 ", 11:27 AM,

So we need a player who is actually not cup-tied.
Gundogan is also perfect because he can effectively play in any position in the midfield in a 4-3-1-2 or 3-5-2. 4-3-3 is not effective for us at this point because Dybala (our best player) will need to play out of position.

The Italian press continues to link Juventus with a move for İlkay Gündoğan,Danny Penza,"Jan 2, 2016, 5:20am PST",Summer Mercato Analysis,"Below is what I think may happen during the next summer mercato:
-Selling one of Morata/Zaza: with Dybala and Mandzukic cementing their places in the starting 11, it’s hard to see Morata/Zaza both in Juve’s roster next season. Selling one will allow the other to enough minutes with the other 2 strikers
-Buying/loaning a cheap 4th striker: i.e. Matri, Borriello, Bendtner
-Buying Berardi: regardless of what the media is reporting, Juve will buy Berardi in the end because they already have an agreement with Sassuolo. Juve bought Zaza in the last mercato in a similar fashion even though he was clearly a surplus.
-Returning Cuadrado: Cuadrado will return because 1. Berardi and Cuadrado play in the same spot and it is expensive to keep both, 2. we don’t have an agreement with Chelsea on the sale price, making negotiations with them difficult, and 3. the new Chelsea boss may have better plans for Cuadrado
-Offloading Caceres: with his recent problems with the management and his poor injury record, he may leave us in the summer. His contract is set to expire in 2016, so he may actually leave after his contract is terminated
-Buying a RB/RWB: With Lichtsteiner turning 32 and the potential departure of Caceres and Cuadrado, Juve may put a big investment in a superstar RB/RWB. Potential candidates may be Darmian or Fabinho
-Offloading Evra: with Sando turning out to be a legit LB/LWB and Evra’s contract expiring this summer, we may see him leaving after his contract expires. If Asamoah returns to being healthy, he may take up a reserve spot to Sandro
-Offloading Padoin: his contract expires this summer. He will retire and work as a director to scout for the next PadoWin
-Selling Pogba: We know that one day Pogba will make a big money move to a rich club. This day may be in this summer, especially if Pogba performs well in Euro 16 and RM/BM/FCB come up with a 100m+ offer
-Buying 2 CM/CAM: If we do sell Pogba, I see us making moves for a superstar CM and a superstar CAM. Potential targets are Gundogan, Isco, Eriksen, Mkhitaryan, …etc
Pogba’s sale (~100m) can fund the 3 superstar players (2 CM/CAM and a RB) if we assume that each will cost ~30m. Zaza’s sale will fund Berardi’s purchase. Our formation in 2016/2017 can look like the following:
Buffon(Neto/Rubinho)
Fabinho(Lichtsteiner) — Bonucci(Rugani) — Chiellini(Barzagli) — Sandro(Asamoah)
Khedira(Sturaro) — Gundogan(Hernanes) — Marchisio(Lemina)
Isco(Pereyra)

PSG can afford to not sell their players – and they’ve done it a lot. Marquinhos tried to force his way to Barca before last season, and they opted to keep him on their bench instead of selling for €45m. Thiago Motta wanted out this season, and they kept him, too. They just don’t sell unless they want to or unless the player forces his way out – and I don’t see either circumstance happening with Verratti.
There’s a slim chance he tries to force his way to Juve, but I can’t see that happening until after Marchisio starts to wane (I don’t see him going to Juve to be the second in command in the midfield, and I don’t see him having a bigger presence than Marchisio).",semperty ,"Jan 3, 2016 ", 1:38 AM,

It’s not that Juve cannot afford not to sell their players, but the management style is different. If a Juve player wants to leave, he can leave. That’s how Juve has operated for as long as I can remember. When Zidane and Inzaghi wanted to leave, they left, and we replaced them with Buffon/Thuram/Nedved. When we were relegated to Serie B, we allowed whoever wanted to leave to leave and whoever wanted to stay to stay.
I don’t see Verratti coming because he is the center of PSG project and PSG will try everything in their hands (hint: a lot money) to keep Verratti.

PSG has a super rich owner – they don’t need to sell to spend. Real get a ton of money from TV/La Liga – they don’t need to sell to spend. Juventus doesn’t have an all-powerful owner and Serie A is the fourth richest league in Europe out of the five major countries.
To put it in perspective, the last three seasons have seen PSG run at a net of negative €255m+ in transfers. Juventus has run at a net of negative €51m. That’s not saying Juve is better/worse, it’s not saying Juve needs to change their policy, but Juventus needs to sell big to spend big – especially in a market driven by two factors they completely lack.
Also, for what it’s worth, Real Madrid have run at a net of negative €142.3m – during which time they’ve brought in Toni Kroos, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, and spent more than €60m combined on Mateo Kovacic and Danilo (lol). They definitely sell in order to fund their transfers at comparable rates of PSG. In today’s game, nothing beats having a rich sugar daddy as an owner – if you don’t have that, you’ve got to find ways to fund your transfers if you want to compete (in terms of transfers) with the ""big boys.""",semperty ,"Jan 3, 2016 ", 2:03 AM,

I never paid that much credibility to something good a player says about his current team; for all intents and purposes, it’s a PR move. See: Vidal, Arturo.
Other reasons you mentioned basically stated that ""we won’t sell Pogba below X million euros"", but didn’t necessarily state ""we won’t sell Pogba period"" (if that makes sense). And you can’t argue for the latter anyway, because if the price is right why wouldn’t you? Not to mention in this period of football, no price is too high.
>We know someday Pogba will move to rich club
Okay this one I can’t get behind, although I can see the reasoning.
>Need to sell big to spend big
semperty’s reasoning regarding this is not bad, IMO. The current iteration of Juventus hasn’t spent any big amount of money on one player. Sure, you can point to Dybala, but I think some members argued that Dybala came from Vidal’s money, just wrong order of transactions. Which was also why we couldn’t seal Draxler.
>Can get 3 Gundogan with this moneyThis one’s a bit of a hyperbole, but you get the idea. The money from Pogba’s hypothetical sale should be spent on world class players (plural), be it Gundogan or whoever else.

By next season Morata will hv experience of three top flight season so he should be able to lead the line, just need to correct his psych, with Zaza and mandzukic ard I think he will pick it up from them.
2) never shd we do tht again I rather tht spot goes to someone young like Zaza then a has been.
3) abt I hv mentioned why I think berardi will be bought regardless, question is will he stay.
4) yes please, no use for him
5) ppl here hv to understand he is as much a RB sub as he is the 5th CB and playing with 352 as frequently as we do you need 5 Cbs, I don’t mind him leaving just means we need an RB & a CB.
6) Vrsaljko over both fabianho and darmian.
7) Evra has been an awesome leader for us, Pogba and sandro. I hope management keeps him ard but he might be like pirlo and adp where he needs to play and can’t sit on bench, that I can understand if he wants to leave the club but I hope he sticks ard for at least one more season.
8) I don’t think he will retire so soon and I don’t think we will let him go just yet as his versatility comes in handy during injury crisis.
9) BM while has said they can spend 100mil on a player I don’t think they will spend that much on Pogba, RM won’t go for him as Perez doesn’t want to work for Raiola, Barcelona seems to hv some tax issue due to which it was reported they only hv 50-60mil budget so unless they are including a player and spending the whole sum on Pogba I don’t see it happening. On city and PSG I hv said before he won’t leave us for them he values professional growth over money and both city and PSG will be sideways move not forward. While guardiola is good for city he will need time to get them used to him. So I kinda of expect him to stay with us for a season.
10) we will hv to offload some players before spending on CM/CAM first I expect hernanes (unless he magically finds form) and Lemina (if we are after gundogan) to be first out and then maybe even one of Asamoah (I hope he stays) or Pereyra",SJ_JUVE ,"Jan 3, 2016 ", 8:36 PM,

Re: Grinta
I apply grinta much differently when it comes to defenders. In defenders I think it adds much more value (See Chiellini, Giorgio). That’s just me personally.
Also with defenders, there’s some things stats won’t tell you like say the number of times they get caught forward and can’t make it in time to get back on defense. I’ll bet my ass Licht will have less of those than Dani.
I like you so don’t take this as an insult, but numbers like tackling rates and interception rates can’t accurately be quantified based on the fact that there are infinite possibilities of the level of player you’re going up against, the ball they’re playing, etc. The beauty of this game is in that. Numbers can tell you part of a story, but they damn well can’t show the whole thing. Licht especially is a guy where you need to watch him to see his beauty.
Full stop, if you like numbers this much and use them for every argument, you should really take up baseball. I’ve been getting really into the sabermetrics of the game lately and I love it.",Anthony Turgelis ,"Jan 3, 2016 ", 10:19 PM,

Besides, as you said, there’s more to it than just the number. Ivanovic probably didn’t have great distances covered last season, but he was almost unquestionably the best RB in Europe.
And I fully admit that numbers don’t cover everything – especially in defense. There are a ton of things that aren’t covered (and the things that aren’t aren’t necessarily covered perfectly), but for Licht to be so bleh at so many things would almost mean that he’d have to be elite at every intangible possible – and he’s not.
Honestly, going by the numbers, he’s probably a below average RB – but I’m not sure anyone would actually call him below average. He’s good at the intangibles and not good at the tangibles – and I struggle to put someone like that in the ""elite"" category.

Also we brought in dybala and morata both could hv easily been one hit wonders but the scouts knew they weren’t. On morata they were in contact for more than 8 mths before signing him so they knew him before he broke out.
We signed berardi, Zaza, sturaro, vitale, got a option on donsah and vrsaljko before others did. If reports are to be believed and convinced them to go to clubs like bologna and sassuolo then we also nearly got 18 yr old mandragora Cm and 17 yr old Pedro pereira right FB from sampdoria who has played 8 games in seria A.

It’s no surprise that the countries who allow teams to field reserve or B teams within their League system are producing far more impressive talent than the ones who don’t. Think Germany, Spain and Netherlands versus England or Italy. This approach allows teams to develop and nurture players their own way against quality competition rather than the loan system whereby players must carve out quality minutes at a team whose primary objective is winning.
Unfortunately, there are too many within calcio who are invested in preserving the mediocre status quo, who would rather restrain Juve than see Italian football flourish. Clowns like Lotito are at the forefront of this insanity but the rot runs deep.",Juve 96 ,"Jan 4, 2016 ", 12:00 PM,

The Italian press continues to link Juventus with a move for İlkay Gündoğan,Danny Penza,"Jan 2, 2016, 5:20am PST",,"The thing is getting the 14-18 year olds are hard as in the early part of the age group they are barely teenagers and they moving to Turin will either require a) their family to relocate or b) having any relative in Turin so they can stay there. The later part of the age group, well any player with potential is already ard 5mil+ you can be spending too much money there or we wont hv much left for the 1st team.
Marotta and Paratici did manage to get some nice coups like Mattiello (who is HG just need to sort out his injuries), Vitale (will be HG IF he is ard for one more season in next 3 seasons). We are ’reported to be after Mandagora, Sensi and Pereira this players are all going to cost at least 5mil and you can throw them in primavera as they are already better than that but not good enough for 1st team, so we hv to send them out on loan. If they were to stay with us for next 3 seasons they will def become HG. Biggest problem like others are saying there is no B team. Like we got Rugani in 2012-2013 season but then we returned him to Empoli as he was abv primavera but not seria A lvl yet and then we bought him back this season. If we had B team he would hv at least stayed for 2 more seasons with us before being loaned out which would hv made him HG.
They are slowly restructuring the whole youth system, the last batch of Marzouk, Buenacasa, sakor seems to be a bust but the new batch Pozzebon, Clemenza, Romagna and Vitale seems like they MIGHT be able to make it into 1st team. We are still yet to see the younger generation youth that were brought in since Marotta and Paratici took over. Secco screwed everything up, it will take time to sort everything back. Its been 5 years since they took over and I am not really sure how much money is being funneled into youth but seeing promising players like Vitale, Clemenza, Romagna in the club and Cerri and Tello doing well loaned out shows improvement s have been made. Our most current ‘successful’ youth product is Buchel he is doing well at Empoli but I doubt he is good enough for us.

In hindsight, I was completely wrong, and have really grown fond of Max. He’s a very good coach, and is a breath of fresh air, because Conte and his antics had become absolutely exhausting when I look back at it. We’re winning in peace with Max, now.
I still think Andrea is underwhelming. He’s not a terrible president and I don’t doubt he’s a Juventino, but despite all the good he’s done, he HAS done a lot of things for show/just for press releases.
