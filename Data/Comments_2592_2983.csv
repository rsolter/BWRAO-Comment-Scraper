- Poor Neto won’t have to make a save at all in CI.
- You know inter has got a creativity problem when you realise their most inventive midfielder is Gary Medel…
- Cuadrado: ok, this ones a bit longer:
We know he has problems finishing his plays on the final third, but most will agree that he is great initiating them. His first 30-40m are direct, fast and disorienting for the opposition, and his early crosses aren’t half bad.

But I’ve watched him a couple of times this year and to me he’s the real deal, someone right in the prime of their career. He’s a real throwback to the natural trequartista of yesteryear.
Clearly has immense technical quality, but he’s got a great physicality/size about him, the way he’s built is just ideal. I can envision him just having his presence felt around the pitch by that alone. He’s got that Pogba sort of arrogance, gliding across the pitch, which can make him seem lazy at times (which from what I have seen, he isn’t).
If we are looking for someone to come in and make an immediate impact for the next 3-4 years, I’d be all for this move. I genuinely think he’s ready to burst onto the scene at a big club. If we’re taking a more long term look, clearly Saponara is the name being thrown around. Whatever it is, options are damn scarce, other than Franco and Ricky, I’m struggling to come up with names.

One of our worst games these season was played in that formation. I still prefer the 3-5-2 because of the following downsides of the 4-3-3:
1- Cuadrado won’t offer Manzu any proper service because he likes to cut in himself, whch results in him losing the ball most of the time.
2- When Morata plays as a winger he drifts apart and goes too wide, which keeps him out of action. We need Morata closer to the post so he can have more scoring chances or at least provide something to Manzu. Not mentioning that Morata will be wasted on the wing because we’d have an already active left side with Pogba and Sandro.
3- Licht is among the ones who need to rest. I would go with a 3 man defense with Rugani or a 4 man defense with Caceres.",Imad J ,"Jan 26, 2016 ", 9:38 PM,

Re: Inter having a bigger chance, don’t be too sure. They also have a high stake to qualify to UCL, so they will still prioritize the league. In fact, I’d say that if they don’t qualify to UCL next season, it’ll be a disaster for them from a financial perspective, simply because they’ve made a lot of financial commitments last summer. Considering the not-so-stellar results that they’ve had in the league these past few games, I’m betting Mancini is in a big dilemma as to whether he wants to play his strongest line up or not.
Besides, last season we played them away with practically our B team after ensuring the league is won, while they used their strongest XI as they were chasing the Europa spot. And we still won.",JDAngkasa ,"Jan 27, 2016 ", 1:22 AM,

Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to retire after 2018 World Cup in Russia,Danny Penza,"Jan 25, 2016, 3:22pm PST",,"So here is my take on it.
A) Lets get this out of the picture as to whether Conte/Allegri had something to do with it or not. They did. Agnelli announced it without ADP knowing about it, if i recall correctly. So they knew what they were doing, and doing it without ADP’s consent (from what i know).
B) Also ,lets forget about money, since ADP has earlier signed a blank cheque for the club ans would have easily done it again.
now, for me the real question is, did they do the right thing or not? and if yes, was the manner in which it was executed right, given the circumstances?
Did they do the right thing or not?
For me, the answer is a yes. In his last 2 years as a juve player, ADP looked like a shadow of the player he was. Every time he had to run, he would stop and look for a killer pass instead. He had lost his legs and was purely relying on his vision and class to get by (not that that’s a bad thing). Now granted his game wasn’t built around speed anymore, but it was becoming a major issue. You can check his stats in his last two seasons. 9 and 8 goals in the two season he was a starter and then 3 under Conte (although i wont count this since he barely feature in the first 11). Add to this the fact that he was the biggest legend the club had ever had, and this had the potential of becoming an issue in the locker room. Remember, ADP is a champ and he had no intention of sitting on the bench. He and his agent made this clear even during the Capello era. I remember back then he was linked in some J-league clubs. So if you keep him, you have to play him. period. Conte wasnt willing (a stand which was vindicated after he wont the league without replying on ADP) and so Agnelli being the head of the organization took the call and bit the bullet for Conte, so to speak. As much as i love ADP, I agree with Agnelli’s call.
B) Was the manner in which it was executed the right way
Right? I dont know. But under the circumstances, there simply was no other way to do it. ADP wouldn’t do it himself. we all knew that. He had offered to sign another blank cheque! So it was up to the management to do it. Now how do do it when you know he wants to play, and the most you can do is offer the bench? Add to this the fact that Gio was about to come back and he DEFINITELY needed space. It had to be Agnelli and Agnelli it was, who made the shock announcement. He did what needed to be done. I would rather see ADP leave the way he did than see him warm the bench for no reason. The fact that ADP still hasnt retired proves that he still wants to play, and this is something Juventus simply couldn’t guarantee him anymore.
Now SHOOOT!",Akshuu ,"Jan 26, 2016 ", 11:57 AM,

It definitely wasn’t the best way to do it. I think ADP wanted to keep playing, maybe even at Juve. Approaching this subject would be a delicate issue for the Directors and would need to be handled delicately. It wasn’t. What was the right approach? I don’t know. I do find it surprising that the issue was not discussed at more detail and then ADP found out in a random press conference.
Him finding out by surprise was probably among the worst options IMO.
The fact that ADP still hasnt retired proves that he still wants to play, and this is something Juventus simply couldn’t guarantee him anymore.

And TBH, there was no ""right"" way to do it. The right way is to sit next to the player and ask him to move on , since you cant promise him a starting spot (which ADP wanted). I’m guessing A) Agnelli tried and failed to convince ADP to leave on his own accord or B) Agnelli didnt have the balls to do it and thought he would do it indirectly via a presser.
If A, he did it the right way and failed and then went to B. If B, then its understandable since it was Conte’s first season as a manager and he probably felt awkward,and even Agnelli was in only his 2nd full season.

Del Piero Form in his last 2 seasons
In his last two seasons in which he scored 8 and 9 goals, Juve was in its shittiest form ever; consecutive 7th finishes with the worst coaches ever (Ferrara, Zaccaroni, Del Neri). So 8-9 goals isn’t that bad considering that ADP was Juve’s top scorer. In the following two seasons, our top scorers (Matri/Vucinic) only managed to score 10 goals
Sitting on the bench
I don’t think Del Piero objected (or would have objected) to sitting on the bench. In Capello era, Del Piero was a lot younger and therefore had grounds to request not to be bench. 2012 is different from 2005
I still think that Del Piero could have stayed for 1-2 additional seasons with Juve, but Conte/Angelli had different opinions. The manner in which Del Piero parted with Juventus is Angelli’s biggest mistake with Juventus",mass19 ,"Jan 26, 2016 ", 3:27 PM,

I might be wrong, but IIRC the buyback option is structured in a way that if Juve accepts any offer from any other clubs aside from Real in an amount that is higher than Real’s buyback option, then the excess would mostly go to Real’s pocket. It’s logical, because otherwise Real’s buyback option would not have any meaning if Morata’s market price goes up.
In this sense, there is absolutely no economic benefit for Juve to sell Morata, even if the offer is astronomical.
Of course, there is a possibility that Juve negotiate with Real to split the ""profit"", but it would be a hell of a complicated deal to do in such a short time, and I still can’t see why would Real let go of such advantage in terms of bargaininh power with Juve.

Absolutely absurd that Zaza was cautioned but nothing happened to Lulic. The cameras didn’t catch the beginning of the confrontation, but ushering Zaza off the field is not Lulic’s job. If he had a problem with Zaza’s urgency he should have spoken with the ref and let him handle it.

I’ve been following this beautiful blog as a silent reader for some time now. It’s my first concrete comment and I just want to say that I love it over here. This site has become number one in my ""most visited tabs"" on my chrome home page. And a daily morning ritual before I start work. Frankly usually I would enjoy the beautifully written articles and heart warming/ sarcastically funny comments you guys come up with, but when it comes to gigi, I simply can’t stay silent.
I’ve been following Juventus since 2001 and i’m a die-hard serie A and azzuri fan. I’m from Lebanon and I would like to inform you that Juventus has one hell of a fan base in the Arab world. But when I go into the inevitable debate with football fans that fell for the young glamour of the other top leagues, I always feel that their love for football is a young teenage love that doesn’t understand the depth of feelings one might have for the sport. That’s why I love serie A. That’s why I will always love it first and foremost. It has something more, something deeper. The stars of serie A are not the ""lady Gaga"" and ""Justin beiber"" of the industry. They don’t control the hype of the media and everything commercial within. They are the beethovens and Mozarts of the industry. They have lesser likes on YouTube but everyone knows their class and elegance is beyond any class. Their loyalty and passion is beyond the materialistic world. Players like Ganluigi Buffon, Alex Del Piero, Paulo Maldini and even Francesco Totti. These players are the heart of Italian football. Something other fans may never understand.
When Buffon retires football will never be the same for me.

MLG please do not take this personally because it’s definitely not just you that does this but I need to rant real quick.
I really dislike statements like this. I really believe that the majority of media bullshit that they spew out is purely speculation and who might be a good fit for a good price for a team. I really think there’s absolutely no way of knowing if a team is interested or has made a bid for a player unless:
1. An agent said specifically that that team is or isn’t interested
2. The team themselves have gone on record saying they are interested or not interested in the player
3. The player has said they are or aren’t interested or there is or isn’t interest.
I understand the media might have some leads. But there’s really no way to know that a team isn’t looking to sign them ever, or that a team is super interested and ready to break the bank and sign someone.
This is why I can’t stand soccer ""transfer reporting"". It sucks. Unless there’s a lot of beef behind something, I urge you not to listen because there’s just really no way of knowing what’s going on behind the scenes.

I was born and raised in Ukraine and it is a beautiful country, I don’t know if now it is a good time to experience it. If you do travel to Ukraine, I would recommend to spend some time in the western part- Chernivtsi, Lviv, Carpathian mountains.

Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to retire after 2018 World Cup in Russia,Danny Penza,"Jan 25, 2016, 3:22pm PST",,"Thank you. It is really a shame what is happening and I get very upset thinking about the whole situation. Still I strongly believe that Russia should have never be allowed to host the World Cup, they were able to get it due to bribes and total corruption, but it is another story. I still have family living in Russia and trust me, I know first hand how awful it really is.
I am planning on visiting my parents and extended family this summer as well, don’t have exact dates yet, they are mostly located in the west. Since you are planning on staying for a while, I would suggest Kyiv-Odessa-Lviv itinerary with venturing out into respective areas. Chernivtsi is called Ukrainian Paris, most beautiful University and grounds, definitely is worth a short trip. Unfortunately, due to ongoing war, local flights are limited, trains/busses might be a better choice. Since the economy is very weak, a dollar goes a long way, you will find transportation and accommodations affordable.
I’ve been to Odessa several times, interesting city and a melting pot for many cultures, as any port city would be. Offers anything from fancy hotels to modest hostels, too noisy for me and I live in NY Better, cleaner and less expensive beaches will be found a bit away from Odessa itself, I would have to look it up.
Definitely visit Lviv, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle,Ivano-Frankivsk (my home town) and spend a few days up in the mountains. Local hutzul culture including but not limited to famous Easter eggs, folk music, wood crafts, etc. is located in Kosiv, Yaremche and surrounding areas. Beautiful.

Although we can still do a lot better. 1-0 could’ve been more, or arrived earlier, and been less dependant on another bit of magic by Paul&Paulo. The key to breaking up a defence (bus) like today’s, is a bigger variety of tempo, turning up the pace before calming down and doing it again irregularly . Coupled with side shifts done higher up the pitch, faster, rather than done by BBC. I’m sure the Allegri and the guys are working on it though, as today was another step in the right direction.
That said, I’m absolutely delighted with the win. The whole team were up to the task. A complete machine, with shiny parts in the right places; Dybala levelling up on his trequartista-quest, scoring a beauty, and on several occasions proving his first touch doubters wrong, while Pogba and Khedira were solid again, as usual these days. And Marchisio. Man of the match, playing his best game of the season so far. Claudio is the sun of our black and white photosynthesis.

Ozil is probably the last of his kind, a pure creator that doesn’t contribute much anywhere else. The new generations of playmaker are usually a hybrid type, either they also have to contribute defensively or in scoring goals as well. I think nowadays, playmakers are more associated to the regista type ala Verratti, or the creative speedy inverted wingers like Hazard and Ribery.

Chiellini was outstanding. Man he’s a good defender.
Khedira too was very good. He’s looking sharper n sharper and his injuries seem to be at bay so this is great news.

They respond to questions as if on auto-pilot; some examples:
Q: Do you want to play for [insert oil-rich club name here]?
A: I’m happy at [insert current club]. In the future we’ll see but for now I’m only focused on our game against [insert next opponent].
Q: Would you like to play with [insert established elite player name here]?
A: I most certainly would like to play with him.
Q: You’ve won 10 games in a row and your next opponent comes into the upcoming game in poor form. Gonna be a really easy one, no?

However, Watching Milan last round and right now today, it just makes it all obvious why Juve wins so many banana-skin games. like one of my most favourite players, Alessio, said ""You can see it in how they defend: 10 players behind the ball like a Lega Pro side trying to avoid relegation. This is the secret – this is what makes the difference.""
Milan Played a perfect game against Fiorentina last week, sound defensively, and alert for the whole of the game with great tactical awareness. Whereas today, immediately after going ahead, they dropped intensity and you could see they had become lazy.

He would be a bet – not to say that I’m against it, just saying that he cannot be the TQ we finally buy for Allegri to build the team on. We need someone more proven than Saponara – then Saponara can be a quality reserve and gain experience in a big team, perhaps be ready in 1 or 2 years.
Also, it would be hard to accommodate both Berardi and Saponara coming in in the same transfer window. Both are young and unproven. Berardi would require a transition towards a 4-3-3, Saponara is better for the 4-3-1-2. We’ll see.",Overlord87 ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 12:42 PM,

He had better numbers than Saponara, but obviously not proven in a higher-level team. That’s why we also brought in Mandzukic – experienced, international profile, proven at the highest levels. Now, what happened was that Dybala exploded immediately and became even more decisive than Manzo (who also had physical troubles at the beginning of the season), but the society has clearly planned the market knowing perfectly well that Dybala was a bet. In the same way, if we bring in Saponara, in my opinion we should also provide Allegri with another TQ that we can safely rely on for all the time Saponara needs to adapt to the new environment. I can’t see us going into CL with Saponara right away (and again, this year we had Morata and Mandzukic as starters in CL for the very first game).

I like the fact that Cuadrado will start. With Evra most likely starting on the left flank, Cuadrado would provide a needed attacking spark on the other flank. Lichtsteiner-Evra would be too defensive
On the other hand, Roma are expected to line up in a 3-5-2 for the first time. Florenzi will most likely having a more offensive role on the right flank and Nainggolan will play Vidal’s role in a box-to-box role

This is even true against the so-called mediocre and lower-level teams, let alone the top-tier teams and their fast wingers. Even Conte shifted to a back-4 when facing Real couple years ago. Earlier this year Max brought out Zona Mista in the home game to widen the field. This requirement (wider defense) will not change with (or without) the De Sciglio or Cáceres.
I fully appreciate and understand that ""replacing"" Cáceres with a FB (even as a back-up) is problematic, especially given how thin (and aging) we are with CBs on the roster. Additionally in the discussion about the back-line (3 vs. 4, starters/reserves and permutations) we need to also include Rugani – his role and development.
He is adjusting and acclimating to a 3 back system. It is a work-in-progress and it is more than obvious that he is ""uncomfortable"". He is caught out of position up-field (tracking primarily) and in the box and hesitant in his approach up-field. He has trouble managing the width and connecting with the midfield and attack. This is not to question his talent and attitude and perhaps this ""swap"" would be an opportunity to transition to a 4-back system which he has excelled at and will be an easier one than the challenges he has been facing with a 3-back system.
However it is too late in the season to unwind all of the training and transition into a fundamentally different base-formation. Cáceres’ versatility to transition between Italy and Europe is very important and it would be detrimental to loose that even if it would mean not bringing in De Sciglio – whom under Max and Gigi’s Juve will find his groove.
The issue is not just reserves but this ""swap"" will translate into an overhaul (not a tweak/adjustment) and will impact Rugani’s development and with these Juve’s campaigns in both Italy and Europe. We have already seen earlier in the season the deleterious impact when the team (personnel and formation) is in a state of flux. Although the addition of De Sciglio would have been near-perfect in the summer, it too late to change now in mid-season.
In short perhaps it is time to move Cáceres and bring in De Sciglio – but not in January.",Sul_Campo ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 4:16 PM,

straight to the point, i have a few questions to ask my fellow juventini
first of all, how come when we played torino in the coppa italia it was in our field? how is that fair to torino, and the quarter final against lazio was at the olimpico, how is this decided?
second question, not really a question, just a thought. the italians that we have in our team, lets take sturaro for example, he was born and raised in italy, and most probably grew up a football fan, its not necessary that he grew up supporting juventus, i find it quite weird that we may have players supporting roma or even merda
third question, how come when theres 3 minutes of added time after the 90, and lets say dybala started the match and played till full time, did he play 93 minutes or 90 minutes? i think it should be 90 cause it was 90 minutes of football, the 3 minutes were added because they were wasted. and if hes considered to have played 93 minutes, how come they dont consider the extra time added at the end of the first half?
fourth and final question, i began supporting juventus in 2008, which is obviously after the scandal, can someone please explain to me in detail what happened? i want to hear juventus’ perspective",KhodorAyach ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 3:38 AM,

I’ll try to answer some of your questions…
1. Coppa Italia home and away is decided as follows:
a. Rnd 16 the home teams are the top 8 serie A teams from the previous years position in Serie A. They enter the competition at this point.
b The home team in the Quarter Finals is the higher ranked team (except that the top 8 serie A teams are not ranked by Serie A league position but rather by the drawing of lots – so Lazio drew a higher lot than Juventus).
c. Who plays at home first in the Semi-finals either follows the same rule in (b) above or the first home team is the first team listed in the fixture sheet from the way the draw is set up.
2. Good observation. I know I would always want to play for my beloved club but I guess professionalism and opportunities play a part and Juve is best in Italy so why wouldn’t you want that chance!
3. Very good points. I agree with you it should be 90mins if it’s not cos as you say any first or second half overtime is in theory time wasted.
4. Referees association, club officials and calcio officials spoke to each other often behind the scenes. It was alleged that this was done to fix matches. Particularly Juve was targeted. Juve was found guilty and punished with demotion to Serie B. Other clubs like Inter were let off.
Last year, more trials and appeals ended up not proving that Juve fixed any matches or influenced the Serie A standings but did show that Juve and many other clubs officials did often talk to and treat referree officials well.
In light of that it seems Juve was wrongly stripped of titles and demoted to Serie B and other clubs like Inter benefitted by being let off.",Paolo C ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 4:20 AM,

Juventus was cleared of all match fixing allegations at the time. Their punishment was for improper contact with a referee designator. Basically, Moggi’s relationship with the head referee was determined to be suspect and, though without any evidence of definite wrongdoing, Juventus was punished for essentially creating a situation in which inappropriate and illegal activity COULD happen. Very weak charge, imo, especially considering the insanely heavy sentence.",dweb ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 7:31 AM,
Report: AC Milan offer up Mattia De Sciglio-Martin Cáceres swap deal to Juventus,Danny Penza,"Jan 23, 2016, 2:00am PST",,"I’ll add a few things. I don’t know elsewhere, but in Italy there are three ""gradi di giudizio"" (I don’t know how to exactly translate it, it means that a trial can be repeated up to three times if there’s an appeal). The first trial was conducted very quickly in 2006, to the point that many people protested that the civil rights of the accused were being denied due to this improper speed. Still, there was a raging sentiment against Juventus those days (imagine that Calciopoli was the wet dream of millions of supporters of other teams that could justify why their teams sucked so much, ""because Juve cheats""), and something very akin to a witch hunt took place. So the first trial was closed and Juventus as a society was found guilty and sent to Serie B. Key Juventus managers like Moggi and Giraudo were convicted as well, along with around 40 referees and linesmen. We were stripped of 2 scudettis, and so on.
Then the second trial came. Around 95% of the referees that were found guilty during the first trial were acquitted of all charges. This practically destroyed the core element of the first trial: that Moggi had created a web of referees under his control that could help Juventus during key matches. This can all be found in the official papers of the trial – they’re in italian, obviously. Anyway, one would have expected that, with so many people acquitted, the whole accusation would fall. It did not happen. Moggi was found guilty, again, even though he practically had no accomplices (in the end, after the third trial, only one referee was found guilty, practically a scapegoat). Italian judges protect each other, usually, and they did so this time: they could not completely thrash the work done by their colleagues in the first trial. Also, Juventus would have had a sound basis from which to get a payback of more than 400 millions from FIGC, and that was something that no one wanted (except, obviously, us).
The third trial more or less went as the second, with a couple more referees acquitted and a confirmation of the conviction for Moggi.
Now, this is my point of view, and it’s a very strong point of view, but a few facts remain:
- only one referee was found guilty at the end of the whole process (from an initial number of around 40)
- it was proven that the appointment of the referees for the games was not under the control of Moggi (meaning, he could not choose which referee would be assigned to each game – this was also in the charges from the first trial)
- a total number of 5 games was considered ""fixed"", only 2 of these involved Juventus. The referee and all the linesmen for 1 of these 5 matches were acquitted of all charges, leaving doubts on even the capacity of logical thinking by the judges (how could Moggi manipulate the result if all the referees were clean? psychic powers?)
- the phone calls between Inter managers and the referees were ignored and never again considered in the process
So, lots of irregularities and strange decisions. It pains me to say this since I’m Italian, but our justice system sucks, and sucks hard. Especially when powerful people are involved. But that’s how things are.",Overlord87 ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 8:06 AM,

It’s true we’re clear favorites, but I’d like the team to stay focused because it’s going to be a tricky game. Roma is an unstable and unpredictable team, and while this often means they’ll deliver shitty performance when you expect them to win, it might also mean that they’ll give 120% and manage to snatch a win you didn’t expect (or maybe a draw, like with Barcellona). They’re desperate and will probably fight like animals – a win on sunday might win their fans back and even reopen their race towards a CL spot.

Juventus has once again become a steamroller. Maybe they ate something bad at the start of the season, but now it seems to me that Juve is hungrier than normal. Once again it seems to me like Conte’s Juve – sly, frenetic, and very physical, with blood in her eyes. To start the season, perhaps things were taken for granted and you pay for that. But the player’s pride kicked in, as it happens when things don’t go well, and there was a reaction. The secret is with the society: at Juve, there is a constant hunger for victory in the atmosphere.

Against Lazio, I saw an extraordinary viciousness: you need only look as far as Zaza’s performance. Champions? When I saw the draw, I thought 60% BM, 40% Juve but it seems to me that in the last month Juve has raised the bar and can play without fear, all things are even. Today, Allegri’s squad seems stronger mentally than last year and is tougher. You can see it in how they defend: 10 players behind the ball like a Lega Pro side trying to avoid relegation.

Not to mention a 10-man Juve despite obvious lack of form and chemistry had made Roma wet their pants for nearly 25 minutes at the end of the game..Has the word ""convincingly"" has gotten it’s meaning changed or they smoke something else amongst roma fans..
Just like Gigi said in his yesterday’s interview, let’s beat them and leave them 10 points behind us.
And For the sake of Serie A and everything Italian football, if these chokers never make it to UCL again, it will be too SOON. They are an embarrassment for the whole league in Europe… and their fanbase as delusional as the club itself, still thinking a 40-fucking-year-old dude is gonna play false 9 and save their season, because some bald fuck who once tried it a decade ago is gonna try it again.

Know your enemy: Talking Juventus-Roma with Chiesa Di Totti's head honcho,Danny Penza,"Jan 22, 2016, 6:00am PST",I want to share a story!!!,"The fire FGJ unwittingly rifled kinda relates.
I have an uncle who is a fan of football but not a specific team, back in the day to my annoyance he would cheer the team Juve where playing, we would always have friendly arguements and debates as to who was the best or who will rise and who will fall. I was the staunch Juve fan, my uncle was more of a neutral and my younger brother was a Milan fan, as you can imagine debates and arguement would be rife and the winner would be happy to have won such a debate. This specific event which i will delve into, happened exactly 10 years ago, Juve where playing Empoli on the day and where running away with the league, my bro always came with the arguement that Milan where better in Europe and we Domestic. On that specific day or year i should say we had a very strong team but neither my uncle or bro would admit it, we had won the previous league and where headed for another and to my surprise on that day me and my uncle sat down to watch the match and what he followed to say to me shocked me to my core as he had never been on either mine or my brothers side in our arguements, but my bro wasnt there, and he sed to me, ""Zia, this team is full of champions, and this team will go down in history they will win everything."" We had a defence consisting of Buffon, Zambrotta, Cannavaro, Thuram, a strong midfield of Emerson, Vieira, Camoranesi and Nedved and out strike force had Trezeguet, Ibrahimovic and of course ADP. I looked at him bemused as to what he just said, i asked him to repeat and he said it again. He followed that with, ""Juve are a team built on morales and strong foundation, when one falls another will rise"".
He continued to tell me about the past Juve teams of Scirea, Platini and Baggio eras and said when this team loses one icon it gains two and at the time i found it hard to believe due to the shock of having my uncle finally side with anyone let alone me. He also said that team was the start of something special, he had never seen a team full of so many winners and champions and said if treated correctly that team will dominate Europe let alone Italy for years and my faith was growing and growing. These words where spoken to me by my uncle who would support Empoli againt my Juve, or Inter against my Juve, it wasnt until years later he explained why he used to do that.
Obviously come May 2006 we lifted the scudetto again and it just happened my uncle was with me to watch that aswell and he looked and said it again that this team will go places. Mere weeks later the news of Farciopoli broke out and lo and behold our team had been ravaged and the the spine torn out of the skeleton. As you know i was devastated and heart broken as im sure we all where. We where being demoted to C1 and i thought, Juve is finished and what my uncle said next was even more unbelievable than what he said a few months before, he said ""this isnt the last of the Old Lady, within 5 years she will claim her rightful throne at the top of Italy’s heirarchy"". I wont lie and say i wasnt sceptical but as the hearings passed and reviews made and case finalised we ended up in serie B. Italy won the world cup, we where in serie B. I thought Juve was finished, player after player was leaving and it was only a matter of time till the legends left aswell. Then news broke out about ADP, Trez, Nedved, Camo and Buffon would stay to bring Juve back i had a glimmer of hope. My uncle left for Canada i started uni and life went on.
Two weeks ago my uncles returned for my wedding which is next week, he brought me a gift, it was the VCR recording of that very match vs Empoli which was 10 years ago today, he reminded me what he said all thos years ago and he was right, Juve are sitting pretty at the top of Italias echeleon withh everyone else drooling wanting to be like her. It was a few days ago he told me he was always a Juve fan and only told me now because he didnt want to choose between me and my bro, he didnt want to add friction, needless to say we both love him dearly, but i can only imagine if i had known what i know now back then how everything would be different.
We sat down brought out our old dusty VCR struggled to get the bloody thing hooked up and working and watched the match and it brought back soooooo many memories. All those arguements and debates. Looking back i truly do wish i knew he was a Juve fan, i mean who wouldnt want to know their crazy football mad uncle supports the same team as me, but i can understand why he never told me, me and my younger bros ""sometimes"" used to get violent and petty over Milan and Juve and i think it was better he was a ""neutral"".

When FIAT factories opened up in the North, many Sicilian men left their homes in the economically depressed south and headed north for jobs. Their families largely remained in the south and the father toiled away, hundreds of miles away from his family, sending whatever money home when he could. Logically, a lot of those men began to root for the team that was, essentially, paying their paychecks. That appreciation of a better life for their families afforded by the Agnelli family opened up an entire region, Sicilia, to becoming Juve fans.
Aside from VERY passionate support in the cities of Palermo and Catania – Juventus fans, more or less, dominate Sicily for this very reason even today.",dweb ,"Jan 22, 2016 ", 2:14 PM,

No, THEY didn’t, only I made 1 post about it in reply to one of your loving members post saying Roma are ‘the laughing stock of Italian football’ and I didn’t say your fans are kids, I said:""You are considered a kids club in Italy"".
So it was not an opinion, but a fact: In Italy Juve are considered a ‘kids club’ as many kids support Juve, the same as all teenagers walk around with Barca/Madrid shirts instead of a shirt from the club out of their own city. English would call it ‘bandwagoning’.
That is not bad in itself, it shows your exposure due to the succes you have and have had, so I can see that it is something that the club can be proud about.
I bet our owner loves this concept and is trying to get (international) exposure as well, getting 14 yr old kids from all over the place wearing Roma kids.
That is however not something Romans want to be associated with, as you are aware they are so proud (in an arrogant way even) of their city, that they don’t want bandwagon fans.
I have to tell you a story though that (no matter how freaking weird for me) was quite impressive: Last september I was in Modica Alta, at the highest point, quietly enjoying the marvelous view over the city with a bottle of wine and my wife.
It was the evening of Man City-Juventus and suddenly, on that peacefully quiet evening, the whole town underneath us exploded: I heard screaming, shouting, singing from one moment to another, as if the Etna had suddenly erupted….
You had scored the equalizer (2nd explosion came a couple minutes later).
I really don’t get it (I am from Haarlem, 20kms from AMsterdam, so I support MY HOMETOWN team (Haarlem), not some other team (Ajax, PSV, whatever) from another city), but I have to admit that it was pretty impressive experiencing that.
As you probably predicted: the next day was Roma-Barcelona, I was lucky to get a guy in a local bar to show the game on a small and old TV, I was watching alone with my wife and some drunk English fellow that happened to be there as well, no one else, (definately not the local Sicilians), cared.",MagicaRoma ,"Jan 23, 2016 ", 5:47 AM,

In part because it isn’t a regional club or one tied to a specific city (despite being older than Torino, they selected the name ‘Juventus’ and instead went with a less location-specific club name), in part bc of their industrialist owners being some of the first and longest standing industrial firms in Italy (well recognized brand and large employer of italians), and lastly in part bc of their specific contribution to the national team, Juventus has always drawn a more diverse and expansive fan base than any other Italian team.
The Italian diaspora also aided in this as italians without a particular city they identify with looked at the national team (that many rooted for) and saw numerous players at Juventus to root for. This is, for example, why you find a lot of Juventus fans in America, I think.

That was the end for them. Montero takes his glasses off, puts them down on the table, and then runs at them and kicks and punches them. Then Fonseca joined him.
Montero loved and respected Zizou, just like I loved and respected Montero. We need more players like him and it’s a shame. He was unique. To him Juventus wasn’t just a club he played for, it was like his family. I will never forget that moment.""

The information factors in a ton of variables (I really wish I had the list off hand – I know he’s tweeted it, but I don’t even remotely remember when), and seems to be pretty accurate.
Basically the data is just saying that Dybala is getting exactly the results you’d expect from him in terms of shots – which is a really good thing. On the other hand, it seems that Higuain is massively out-performing his expected production.

Sturaro strikes me as the type of player who doesn’t have natural ability so would be a very average player at a mid table club but at Juve he’s surrounded by world class midfielders and is absorbing everything like a sponge which has taken him on a path to become a very high quality midfielder and just an overall beast in the middle of the pitch.

This season I must admit he’s looked a bit awkward on the ball while retaining his dogged like characteristics. But he has shown flashes of technical prowess.
I still think if he can improve his passing game and on the ball he could turn out to be a very valuable player.

In these areas, no Juve midfielders can match him. Right about now, this is the whole point of having him in the squad, to give Allegri the option to play a midfielder whose role is to ""bite"" the opposition’s midfield, not to give them time to dilly dally on the ball. Incidentally, in a well drilled squad like Juve, having just one player who runs that much more would in some ways give energy to the others, push them to run just a little bit more.
So yeah, the whole discussion about whether he is talented is a bit off, in my view. Sturaro has a role in this squad, just like Padoin has a role. It’s not a problem that he’s not as talented as Pogba or Marchisio or Khedira, because they too have their roles. The key point here is whether he knows what his role his, and whether he’s committed to do his best and develop himself accordingly. It becomes a problem if a player doesn’t ""know"" or doesn’t ""agree"" with the coach on what his role is. Whether he can develop into a more well rounded player (more useful going forward, better at keeping the ball, etc), that remains to be seen, and I don’t see why we have to decide now.

In fact, I’m certain Mattiello would’ve been able to play his role at let back in those couple of games, but Max didn’t have the cojones to play him because he had Padoin there.

I would much rather have our youth players being a back up to our back ups, even if it means seeing mistakes, errors or whatever from them.

On a positive note, our latest trend of investing in young players (below 18) is an indication that we’re at least trying to address this issue. Like I wrote before, we only have Marchisio as home grown under UEFA definition, and that’s not good. This rule forced us to exclude Asamoah out of the UCL list during the group stage (which is fine because he was injured), and in Feb we will need to decide who to leave out in the knock out rounds (it won’t be Asa, unless he’s injured again. My guess it will be Lemina). Long term, it’s going to be an issue.
If we want to stay at the top in Europe, then we’re going to need to start ""producing"" some quality home grown. That’s why I believe Mandragora will not be loaned out.

Fielding mattiello instead of padoin tho is wrong, the kid is 19 year old asking him to start as a sub when evra was injured is too much. He has yet to play in serie B. If we had B team like Barcelona/RM it would be different.
Just recently Coman commented on how much pressure there is at Juve and fielding a young defender without a minute of senior experience isn’t a GOOD IDEA. Rugani is struggling despite a whole season with Empoli.

The way Jeep gets involved in our journey, especially during pre season and in Europe is unseen before, at least from my perspective.

http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/sports-business-group/uk-deloitte-sport-football-money-league-2016.pdf
you can find the revenue of all major football clubs in this pdf. the revenues are split in 3 categories: matchday revenue, broadcast revenue and commercial revenue.
last season real, barcelona and juventus had the highest broadcast revenue (199m each). that’s tv rights, champions league money etc.
out of the top 10, we have the lowest matchday revenue (51m compared to arsenal’s 132m), even some teams outside the top ten make more than us. we’re good compared to other italian teams, but juve will never be able to compete with teams from larger cities with huge stadiums in this regard.
the term commercial revenue in deloitte football money league refers to sponsorship, merchandising and ""other commercial operations"". this is were we are really, really bad:
juventus 73m
…
barcelona 244m
real madrid 247m
manchester united 263m
bayern münchen 278m
(psg 297m including 200m oil money)

2) player’s appeal
Regarding point 2, most other top teams have bigger names that sell many many jerseys (Messi, CR7, Ibrahimovic, Lewandowski, Robben, and so on). Until 2-3 years ago, we had Giovinco and Vucinic. You can see the difference. Right now our player with the greatest appeal is probably Pogba. I think Dybala will explode quickly.

The difference between Morata and Zaza imo atm is that Zaza is enjoying every single minute on the pitch he gets. Morata feels he needs to do too much which is preventing him from doin what he does.

Coppa Italia Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Lazio,Danny Penza,"Jan 20, 2016, 10:15am PST",,"Had a rewatch, what a great high-tempo game. Lazio went in hard, respect, but Juve had full control. Could have scored a couple more, easy.
I was sure Hernanes would make a start, after Allegri said he’d bench Pogba again. Had everyone fooled!
Sandro looked lively at the first half, Pogba did good in stints but throughout. Morata very unlucky, but he don’t look like he’s given up or anything and that’s good. Hustle play. Cuadrado basically . . won’t be a permanent in this club.
Other than that, everyone did good. Neto, Caceres, CM8, even Sturaro could have had a goal, too.
Zaza gotta be man of the match though. He put in a crazy shift. With a bit more luck the one off the post would have went in, not that I minded that Goal Line Tech Lichtsteiner Slide Ruler Special.

He has been likened to Thiago Motta who never reached his full potential for two reasons

2)Athleticism
Mandragora doesn’t have a problem in either of those areas so I hope he can reach the level Motta could have. Mandragora has also be praised for his technique, maturity, leadership and footballing intelligence.
IF he reaches his potential he could be one the best holding midfielders in the world and could be a key member of the Juventus team for the next 10-12 years.

Juve could decide a totally different route this next summer, scupper the ‘plans’ they have w Berardi, and go for another attacker altogether. As for Sensi, nothing concrete links Juve to the player other than tenuous murmurs regarding the Juventus-Sassuolo relationship and generally Juve’s interest in him (along with most other ‘big’ Italian clubs, mind you).
As to your final point – sure, it is nice for Juve to buy and own some of the better young talent on the peninsula, but the club has been doing this for a long time and very few of these starlets ever end up breaking into the first team. We’ve seen how hard it is for Rugani to grab minutes and he has an entire season as a Serie A starter under his belt – Mandragora, meanwhile, is playing in lower divisions (with a few Serie A appearances sprinkled in) and may not be much more than a make-weight in future negotiations with other Italian clubs (as we have seen countless times before with similar talent).

I am using experience, statistics as well as Balo’s current psychological state to estimate that. But if you want more, wait for both of them to retire.
Balo, in just 3 year with Inter, won more than Cassano did the rest of his career. That doesn’t even include his trophies w City.
We all know what he ""won"" domestically with Inter, dont we? As for the UCL win, he was an unused sub if i recall correctly. Oh and congratu-fuckin-lations for winnings the BPL in the last minute of the season with a squad that like that!
With the opportunities that he has had, he is nothing but an utter failure. Hats off to liverpool for spending money on him. I mean, anyone with a hint of knowledge about psychology would know that he is nothing but a baby in a man’s body. He has no mind, no maturity and no desire to improve. Compared to him, Cassano feels like a mature person (what?). Now stats time: his best domestic season as a CF? 14 goals. For an elite striker, that is chump change.

OFFICIALLY OFFICIAL: Juventus sign midfielder Rolando Mandragora from Genoa,Danny Penza,"Jan 19, 2016, 2:35am PST",Balance,"This is not going to be an easy game – especially since Lazio sees the CI as a path to European qualification given their under-performance and overall schizo season.
Too many changes (especially in the defense and midfield) would be unwarranted.A balance needs to be struck between providing quality game time to the bench (e.g. Neto), resting some key players for the upcoming critical games without loosing momentum and cohesiveness.
Assuming that 3-5-2 is the starting point, if Max decides to go with Rugani – then he needs (defensive) support from the midfield and Licht would be preferred to Cudrado. This need is even further accentuated without Gigi marshaling the defense. I am not sure how Sturaro and Rugani combination would work on the right-hand side, especially if Anderson has a good day. By the same token, Marchisio is needed to manage the defense and link-up field. To put Hernanes in the deep-lying regista (or the like) position given his past performance (lapses) and all of the other changes would be ill-advised for him and definitely for the team. He is regaining his confidence and should not be put in a position to compromise the team. Will Pogba be rested two-games in a row? Given the upcoming Roma game and Asa’s solid performance and need for game time – not highly improbable.
Looking at your list and following a ""balanced"" guideline:
Neto
Cacerras/Rugani Bonucci Chiellini
Sturaro/Licht Marchisio Asamoah/Hernanes Sandro
Dybala Morata/Zaza
Although one could see Mandzu and Pogba stepping in if we fall behind early.

I think Lichtsteiner should be rested too. He has been consistently playing and he is on the wrong side of 30.
Sturaro should slot in instead of Sami.
Pogba should play tomorrow because:
1. he was rested in the last game
2. it’s too risky to bench both Pogba and Dybala, who have provided much of the attacking threat so far in the last 10 games
On the left side it’s a battle between Asamoah and Sandro. I prefer Asamoah because I want him to play more and he probably provides better defensive cover than Sandro, especially with Cuadrado being on the right side

And with this backdrop it’s completely understandable that there are PC police and victims that refuse to let it go.
Re the Sarri incident, you have to have some standard which you hold people up to. One part of that is anti-discrimination a part of which is not using discriminatory words eg homophobic, racist etc.
You then say – well why shouldn’t we ban anything offensive?
I guess I’d split things into two categories. One is discrimination and the other is offensive behavior.
1. With discrimination we’re trying to protect particularly under threat sections of community and unequal practices that’s why certain specific topics/areas are banned and we try to prevent derogatory words in this realm to stop the currents in society that encourage bad behavior against these sections of the community.
2. Offensive behavior – The being offensive part is kind of tricky. Whether or not it’s okay to be offensive outside the realm of discrimination (and what constitutes being offensive) is a grey area. Eg it’s okay to say ""You’re a hopeless coach"" but may not be ok to say ""You’re mother is a slut"". This one’s a whole area of debate as you allude to with the Zidane incident but is separate to discrimination if it’s not involving the use of discriminatory behavior or words.
I mean I’m thinking this through as I go but there are whole bodies of law and thought on this issue that I’m pretty sure work along these lines.
There’s a reason we have anti-discrimination laws and the human rights treaties etc. To discourage discrimination and discriminatory behavior and I think a professional sportsperson like Sarri calling another coach a faggot (or insert any other homophobic word) as a derogation is running contrary to that whole body of thought.",Paolo C ,"Jan 21, 2016 ", 1:09 AM,
OFFICIALLY OFFICIAL: Juventus sign midfielder Rolando Mandragora from Genoa,Danny Penza,"Jan 19, 2016, 2:35am PST",There was a 'case' in Australia a few years ago,"Where a talent show was performed with 5 white people disguising themselves as the jackson 5 and lip-sync one of their songs. They did the same act a year ago and won it, but that year a guest judge from USA (I think it was Harry Connick Jr.) was invited in the show, saw the act, and blast the performance as ‘racist’.
Now a question: was the performance a dig on all black people? No it’s not, it’s a dig on Jackson 5. Wouldn’t you agree he was simply enforcing his view based on his own culture and experiences? This shouldn’t be any more offensive than Justin Timberlake dressing like Jessica Simpson and actually insulted her intelligence on the Oscars (don’t ask me when, but I’ve seen it; I’d argue that was more offensive than this)
All of this is not supposed to be saying that he’s to blame for thinking that way, but… discrimination is perceived in different ways by different people and it affects people in different ways. The moment you try to regulate it, you run into all kinds of problems, because anything you say CAN offend anyone and eventually nobody is happy.

OFFICIALLY OFFICIAL: Juventus sign midfielder Rolando Mandragora from Genoa,Danny Penza,"Jan 19, 2016, 2:35am PST",,"I’m having a bit of trouble trying to understand the point you’re trying to make Benedict.
I certainly don’t agree with your implication that you shouldn’t regulate discrimination because discrimination can be perceived differently by different people. That’s no reason to allow discriminatory behavior. It just means lines need to be drawn as objectively as possible about what’s discrimination and what’s not.
I’ll post below the relevant section of the Australian Discrimination Act which tries to do that.
Re your Jackson 5 example it’s hard to see how that would be objectively discriminatory if they just dressed up and sang like them. If they did things that were clearly aimed at mocking black people in their routine then that might be another story.
Interestingly Australia has an exception for artistic performances provided they are done in good faith.
The JT Jessica Simpson example is a good one to show the distinction between offensive and discriminatory. As far as I can tell he was just mocking / being offensive to her directly not based on any of the discriminatory categories like race, religion, sex etc.
So to me it demonstrates the potential difference between the Jackson 5 incident and the JT incident.
You said:
Unfortunately the 2 categories you tried to split isn’t very much split in that law you talk about, because now a case for ‘offense’ can be moved into ‘discrimination’, simply by considering WHO was offended.
But the two cases are quite clearly split in the law. A case for offense can only be part of discriminatory laws if it falls within one of those categories of discrimination such as race, religion, gender etc.
Here are sections 18C and D of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Australia) which are an interesting read. It’s a bit hard to read here so here’s a link as well
section 18C
Section 18D
18C Offensive behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin

(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:

(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and

(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.

……

18D Exemptions

Section 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith:

(a) in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or

(b) in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or

A black person can be offended without it being racially discriminatory.
Eg I could offend a black person by saying ""You are an idiot"". That’s offensive but not racially discriminatory.

Berardi will replace Cuadrado, who will likely return to Chelsea at the end of the season because we have no option to buy him. Berardi can either play as a RW, or possibly be tested in a CAM role, as Allegri has already talked about the option of playing Berardi behind the strikers. Berardi and Pereyra will alternate for the TQ role next season.
I don’t see Morata going back to RM at the end of the season unless if Zidane somehow convinces Morata to return. With the current form of BBC, Morata will find it very hard to break into the first team.

Re Mandragora: Marotta and Agnelli doesn’t really believe in loaning players for development. They’ve been quoted to say that loaning is a guaranteed way to lose control over player development. When they loan players, it’s usually to advertise them to potential buyers. If they want to develop the player, it’s usually the Sensi route.
In any case, I understand that it’s too early to speculate what will happen to Rolando. The management will likely decide after the preseason.

He had tried that move (going into the area from the left and shooting with the right) a couple of times in past games, this time he got it right.
Khedira in particular had looked a little slow in the last game, but he was amazing today.
This was a good game for Morata to score, but it seems that his bad period will continue a little more (I hope he can score on wednesday against lazio).
Second half we practically didn’t play, and even then we could have scored another couple of goals. Otherwise this could have ended like 8-0. But whatever, it doesn’t matter. Still, it would have been fun to see Zaza in a game like this, considering that he always wants to break the world when he plays.

After the first Pogba or Dybala touch on the ball the game is paused for him to reenact (replay) the move that either ends in a Pogbooom or a Deeee-bala Goa1 – and sometimes both!

Yea, that’s why we sold him to Dortmund a while ago.
On a serious note, I would probably agree that we could move away from a slow regista type, but it seems Max is insistent on playing one and if that’s the case then Kroos would be an absolute outstanding addition to the midfield.
The thing I don’t love about treq is that barring a few that can play on the wing effectively, they’re pretty limited tactically. Most of the better ones like Ozil (he’s proved me wrong this season), Gotze, Mata, etc., are pretty limited to that spot in the hole.
All things considered, I’d say buy either a treq or regista depending on who is available, just get the better player. If Kroos is available, get him. If Isco/J-Rod is available, get him.

And yes, Vidal is amazing. But his influence on the game is far far less when he’s playing at TQ. I can think of so many occasions where his B2B instincts kicked in while both defending and attacking, in terms of his positioning, and he had to stop to check his movement and hustle back to where he ought to be. Couple this with the fact that Pirlo had a pretty poor year, and his playing away from his best position (And I mean BEST position, because no one can convince me that there was a better B2B in the world than Arturo from 2012-2014) meant that he never really played himself out of the psuedo funk he was in, and I still stand by my opinion that I don’t think all 4 on the pitch at once was our best formation. Yes, he wasn’t really doing anything wrong, but his performances levels were incredibly low as compared to the lofty standards he set for himself in his first three years at the club. I suppose when you’re defending a slender lead away to Madrid, starting the game with the vastly more defensively sound Vidal and not Pereyra makes sense, considering he can be a goal threat to score a sucker punch too.
And as Donzia added above me, Pereyra was absolute dynamite. He offers a directness and intuitive playing style that kinda raises the game of everyone around him. When he’s on the pitch, and on song (granted: he isn’t the MODEL of consistency), our attack looked so much more fluid. Case in point, I don’t think anyone is going to convince me that he wasn’t our best player for the first horrid month of this season. Through our struggles, he was the only one creating both goals and goal scoring chances for his teammates. He is so vastly underrated..

Imagine him not playing Pirlo in a big CL game like the final, and starting the lesser known Pereyra. If he loses any sort of big match with Pirlo on the bench, he would get absolutely slaughtered by the press, fans and likely even the board. Not saying it’s justified at all, I just think that’s what would have happened.
Pirlo was the worst of our MVPP quartet last year, that much I think everyone can agree with, but being the legend he is, I just couldn’t see Max voluntarily benching him in a big game.

That said, the idea of Pogba supporting the front two, with Khedira-Marchisio-Asamoah/Sturaro behind him, intrigues me.. Atleast Khedira and Asamoah are the kinds who roam around very intelligently, and sprout in very interesting positions while attacking. I think Pogba has what it takes to thrive there, and form a brilliant partnership with the deep-dropping Dybala. I still think that his best position is B2B though. He’s crucial in taking the ball out of our half, and his defensive play and positioning has improved by leaps and bounds. Besides that, he has formed an almost telepathic understanding with both Evra and Sandro, not to mention Chiellini. We lose a lot of that if we push him forward.

There are only 2 teams in La Liga with a sustained champions credentials with a rotated 3rd team every 5 years, and epl is decided by who decides to spend more money that year (Man U this year aside).
But there will always be teams that rise up to their challenges, since unable to compete with money means they have to compete through other means, and gems are found. The better juve gets, the higher the ceiling is. from the league standing point of view the league might look stale, but if you compare it by competitions and each team’s quality, they’re leaps and bounds from the fiasco of 06-07. Juve showed how to run a football club. Some clubs are more dense than others(really how long does it take city rivals to realise they’re better off with separate stadiums?), but those who learns from juve improved heaps. The only reason why juve still stands supreme is because it stays ahead strategically above everyone else. The day we become complacent for a second is the day we’ll lose the league.

however let’s talk hypothetically: what do you have in mind when you ""filter out"" a certain user? do their writings just gone (in your display), or more like toggle-able visibility, defaulting to hidden (but you can still click them to read). what about the chain of replies? should it follow the rule on ‘parent’ comment (when the parent is hidden or gone, so are all the replies under it. just like now when a comment is removed by mod), or the replies would still be visible (like current disqus, for example).

lich leo chiellini sandro
sami marchisio asa

mandzu dybala
that’s an all action midfield and I think we’d give Bayern serious issues up the middle if they start alonso. Also the thought of sandro asa AND pogba linking up on that left side is salivating

You could make a case for many of them.
Buffon – strong as always. Probably hasn’t had to do enough to vote him MVP.
Dybala – he got my vote although I could easily have voted for others. He was consistently high standard throughout the first half.
Pogba – he’s also hard to go passed. Yes he was poor early on, but there was so much pressure on him. Once he got going he looks his incredible self with strength skill and everything else a footballer needs. He’s even added that TQ ability to feed some great passes.
Marchisio – What can you say? Once he came back we’ve been winning again. The unseen key to our team that keeps us ticking over.
Chiellini – I was almost tempted to vote for him. I’ve gotta say I was so impressed with him live the three times I saw him. He absolutely hounds the shit out of defenders and does everything you don’t want as a striker.
Mandzukic – He did come good and score some important goals but too inconsistent with his bad patch probably doesn’t deserve the vote in my opinion.

To me he’s a conundrum. Can look good but not actually produce much and be detrimental to the team.
When I was watching Juve Palermo in Palermo it was really interesting to see how when Cuadrado came on he seemed heaps out of sync with the team and Max spent most of his time berating his positional play and choices from the sideline.
Don’t get me wrong, I think Cuadrado can be good and is not bad as RWB but I think he can be a very individualistic player (it’s just his game) and play can lose momentum and direction when the ball goes to him.",Paolo C ,"Jan 16, 2016 ", 12:22 AM,

One of the reason Mandzukic was bought was his work ethic when the team doesn’t have the ball. This is a man who leads our attack, yet what everyone acknowledge from him first and foremost is his contribution during the defensive phase of the game.
The word you’re looking for is ""balance"". The problem with Cuadrado is that he doesn’t have the intelligence of Lichtsteiner. Also, remember that the fullback sometimes need to tuck in and help mark the opposition’s striker when the ball is at the other flank. Do you believe Cuadrado can be disciplined enough to mark Insigne, Salah, Gervinho when they make diagonal runs into the box, trying to attack the space when Barzagli, Bonucci, and Chiellini had to slide to the left and help Evra?
A team play relies on trust. If his teammates in front of him don’t trust him during the defensive phase, they will subconsciously cover for him, and this will in turn dull their offensive contribution. Even with more offensive players on the pitch, you will end up with less offensive game. Khedira, who will likely play the MCR, will be more inclined to stay back. Dybala, who will become more isolated up top (because Khedira no longer support him as frequently as previously) will need to drop back more and get further away from goal. In turn Mandzukic will have to drop back as well for the same reason.
Of course, this would not happen if the team is ordered to play an unbalanced game. Look at Real Madrid, for example. They don’t care about the disconnect between the defensive units and the offensive ones. They don’t mind Marcelo running havoc, because they’re happy as long as they outscore the opponent. That’s why over a 50-games season, they get silly scorelines like 7-2, but also lose games quite a bit more frequently. And sometimes, they lose 0-4. Even Cannavaro struggled in Spain. How did they survive that long without ""balance""? Easy, they have players like Ronaldo, James, Bale, Benzema, Kroos, Marcelo. Do we have that kind of players, or even the resources to attract those type of players? More importantly, is that the route that we want to take going forward?

There’s no harm in playing Cuadrado as a WINGBACK, when Sandro, Chellini, Bonucci, Barzagli, Khedira, Marchisio and fucking Pogba are already starting.
One thing I also want to add, is the fact that everyone here is EXTREMELY underrating Cuadrado’s defensive contribution and abilities, you guys are treating him as a Dybala (defensively), when he’s a Pogba (defensively). He runs back harder than anyone in the whole team.

His mentality is great, he is really mature for his age and a club like Juventus would be ideal (certainly for me ;-)).

Not only am I SUPER suspicious of the claims made to Napoli’s president during Eta Beta’s time there (afterall, the police office does seem to have some sort of personal issue with Fabio), but I find it odd that despite this rumored activity and controversy, Fabio went on to have the most success of his career when he arrived at Juve.
Either way – I hope that Fabio can find a settled place to play without crazy, jilted ex-friends, nutso fans, or hyper-reactive owners sabotaging his chance for success. Always felt that he was a professional player with a killer instinct – I admire those kind of strikers.

For me he is the ideal candidate for this role, talent, skill, creativity and dribbling is already there, its just to harnest it to the fullest. There is always talk of how much he contributes in the midfeild but what if get someone who can give the same midfeild contributions as pogba. which brings me to Axel Witsel some here have mention his name and i also want to endorse it.

If we were to aquire him i feel our midfeild would be the abosolute best in Italy an Europe and it wouldnt cost more than 18-25 when in reality you cant even buy top class CAM in this market for that money, farless pay their wages.

The mister is one who looks at who the man is before he considers his quality on the pitch. He won a lot in his career yet still has hunger for more. He absolutely despises losing. I think that it totally makes sense that Juve won so much with him as their manager.

As soon as I arrived at Juve, I could sense the scent of victory. If you dont win, it’s a total failure. Every year, this expectation of victory resets itself.

Basically, there’s no central defense in Spain or France, no wide defense in Italy or Germany, no defense until the final third in England, and just no defense in Belgium or the Netherlands.

I guess the sellers name the price but marotta and paratici try and gouge it based on their potential + attitude + mentality. I remember reading that Paratici watched Morata’s trainings too and went to his house to meet him. So I guess they usually see their trainings at least to determine do they put enough effort to reach their potential. That shd put the odds in our favour so even if we fork out a couple of extra millions we shd be able to make good return on them unless they get injured and derail their career.

He is a good player, good technique, good shooting with both feet and not too shabby vision. Only, he’s no Pirlo and he’s no super-duper CAM no more. I don’t think he ever was, to be honest. He had a good stint with Lazio but inconsistency is his biggest flaw, because he always tries to do too much.
Whenever he tries to do too much, he fails miserably.
He needs to stay within the confines that allow him to play comfortably, bringing his stronger attributes into play, and the rest will follow.
I think he understands now what he needs to do in order for him to play better in a team. If youse no team player you will always find it hard to fit in at our club.

Hernanes just might carve out a role at Juventus after all,chris-9999,"Jan 12, 2016, 1:30pm PST",,"He was the best player in Lazio for several years, and was rarely inconsistent. He was stripped from his ""home"" for money before his contract expired, and left Lazio rather unwillingly.
Maybe Inter didn’t work with him well, and maybe we do (although I’ve seen us done our fair share of treating players badly). But based on statistics that could actually be captured on whoscored, he was the second best player on the pitch against Sampdoria. Look at the trend; great stats in Lazio, abysmal in Inter. If we manage our resources well, and if fans actually get behind their playes, we have a winner at our hands.
In my opinion, you guys should be ashamed of yourselves. Some of the jaded ""regulars"" and a bunch of negative newcomers. If you guys had been around during ADP’s horrific injury crisis where he was forced to reinvent his pace game, that would mean we won’t have Il Capitano in our team. Remember when Buffon replaced Storari? He was nowhere near Storari for an entire season, but we gave him the chance to regain his game. Marchisio has been blamed of being invisible since Del Neri during the LM days, and still carries that title from the fans here, yet his absence is the MOST felt compared to any other player on the pitch.

We could debate this all day long but this season Hernanes performance from a technical standpoint has been poor.
I haven’t followed him in the past and by all accounts he was very good at Lazio. But that was the past. I can only judge him in current performance and he consistently looks out of his depth this season. For one thing his short passing game and decision making has been poor. In tight situations he just doesn’t know what to do and turns the ball over easily or puts enormous pressure on the person he passes to.
Second half v Samp he was much better but this was when the game was more open and less pressure on him. This shows he can play – some nice passes etc. And all throughout the game he made some nice interceptions. And he always has had a good shot and freekick.
But the job of the regista is to control possession and the game for his team. Hernanes has not showed this ability. He has looked very clumsy and awkward on the ball when the game is tight, tough and the pressure’s on.
I don’t trust him, especially against better teams and important matches. I’d still be very happy to seem him leave and would prefer Lemina when fit (or a new midfielder) as the back up to Marchisio.",Paolo C ,"Jan 12, 2016 ", 9:08 PM,
Hernanes just might carve out a role at Juventus after all,chris-9999,"Jan 12, 2016, 1:30pm PST",You have a fair point,"but fans can only see what’s on the field to make their judgement. And for those players who prove the fans wrong, there are also those who were given many chances only to still end up a flop. If mandzukic still hasn’t scored to this day (remember his droughts in the first few months? anyone?), given our depth in striker position, should we be condemned for wanting him to be dropped to give someone else a go? By definition this is getting behind your team, even if some individuals will inevitably suffer.
And I think you overestimate the effect of fans’ attitude on players performances. To your ADP example; fans aren’t coaches nor transfer directors, therefore no matter how much the fans react negatively to his post-injury form ADP would’ve still stayed, and then prove those fans wrong and won the affection over again. Fans will always have opinion, though I’m glad our board are those who with quite confidence knows what they’re doing and won’t be swayed by popular thoughts, unlike RM.
And are we always the fickle type? I don’t know… For morata’s lack of goals all of us here still supports him. If you look at fans of other teams (even in serie A) I see this blog is still generally the more reasonable types.",benedictsoetardjo ,"Jan 12, 2016 ", 9:14 PM,

Hernanes provides no such glimpses of hope. He’s been dead rubber for 2 years now. Nothing against him on a personal level but he’s been given countless chances which he has not taken and he doesn’t even try.

Am I crazy here or does that strike anyone else as wildly incorrect? The campionato this season is an incredibly tight race with the 4 top teams separated by only 3 pts. Juventus seems poised continentally (finally) while the teams in Europa are capable and also playing well.
In 2009, there were obvious and lingering side effects still from calciopoli. I wouldnt say it was remotely stronger back then.
As for Spalletti – I don’t think Im too worried. For all of the admiration and love he seems to receive from Roma fans (who are undoubtedly excited today at yet another firing of a wayward manager and his replacement but yet another savior du jour), Spalletti’s time in Rome wasn’t really a resounding success. Despite the seriously weakened field of competitors (as a result of calciopoli), he managed 2 Coppa Italia victories, a Supercoppa, and 2 Second Place finishes (one in which he was more than 20 pts off of Inter in first). He performed somewhat well in the UCL – i.e. didnt get slapped around like Garcia did by the big boys and even beat RM over 2 legs. Otherwise, he was the beneficiary of a very fortunate situation on the peninsula at the time. Does anyone really think that he will be able to not only right the ship in Roma while simultaneously clawing back up the table in direct competition with this year’s Fiorentina, Napoli, Inter and Juve?

Not really. Inter and Milan were much stronger back then than they are now.

He played well vs Man City in that first game, but then it was a huge drop. He just doesn’t look comfortable on the ball. Last game he did better than before, had an OK performance with a few recoveries and some good passes but he would get the ball and lose it quickly like he was starting one step too late. This happened often and close to Juve’s box. He does look dangerous whenever he manages to take shot. But this doesn’t happen often due to tactical reasons, lack of confidence or lack of trust from teammates(?).

I’d do the same if I was asked to vote.
why don’t they set up a committee that nominates these players by representatives of each league? e.g. those who play in their league votes for their top 5 nominees for their league only, do this by league and competition.

I mean 70% ppl here refuse to admit pique had better season than chiellini (bonnuci was best overall).
As I have said before they shd just go back to the old ways Ballon D’Or used to be decided by French journalists while they weren’t free of controversies too they were much more fair. I mean they gave Nedved Ballon D’Or when he deserved it instead of their French star Henry which according to arsenal and French supporters is a blasphemy.

Nor is he in the situation of a youngster needing to be trusted.
Hernanes strikes me as the kind of player who does just enough to get on the highlight reel and fool people into believing there’s hope to be had in him. A long-range effort here and there and you’d think he’s not too shabby. But once you analyse his displays outside of these rare moments, he’s horrendous, offers little protection to his defence (those late jitters against Sampdoria can partly be attributed to his ineptness in controlling the tempo and the abll), mostly passes the ball sideways and backwards. With Pereyra and Asamoah returning to the fold, we now have those 2 plus Marchisio, Sturaro, Khedira and Pogba available for 3 midfield spots. Barring a major mishap to one of them, Hernanes shouldn’t be getting anywhere near the starting XI.
Most damning of all for him is that the team embarked on a winning run right when he became unavailable through suspension, then injury. Not too fussed as he arrived for a low price but he’s well well below what one would expect at such a club. In fact if it weren’t for him I’d give Marotta 10/10 for his transfer dealings in the summer… factoring in Hernanes it’s more like a 9.5 (9 when he’s on the team and hurting it).
Cuadrado is another one I have trouble with. He was in the starting line-up for most of the woeful early part of the season. His winning goal against Torino may well have been a turning point in Juve’s season… yet after that the side has played a lot better since he’s been demoted to a substitute role.",Il Conte di Monte Cristo ,"Jan 24, 2016 ", 9:19 PM,

Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba named to FIFPro World XI,Danny Penza,"Jan 11, 2016, 12:50pm PST",,"The relationship between Umberto Agnelli and Pavel Nedved was famous. Umberto used to take morning walks to Pavel’s home in the outskirts of Torino and would occasionally join the Czech and his wife for coffee. Pavel credits the elder Agnelli greatly with helping him settle in at Juve during a very tough period for him in his career; some find it quite difficult to switch to Juve in a high-profile fashion (they can’t all be Dybala, after all). This relationship with the president showed Pavel that Juventus wasn’t just another football club with talented players, but a family where everyone looks out for the other and is concerned with their well-being. Pavel was able to adjust to Juve’s demands and atmosphere and went on to win [perhaps] the 2nd most precious trophy in all of calcio, the Ballon d’Or. He is obviously paying back that faith, trust and collegiality that Umberto showed him in his current director’s role.
I sometimes also wonder how much Andrea learned from his father – and how much history may be repeating itself before our eyes. Seeing Andrea goofing around with the players, constantly at Vinovo, and hearing how he talks about his club, I cant help but feel that that same attitude his father brought to Juve, Andrea is trying to mimic.
Here in a goofy photo opp, we see yet another Juventus midfielder of whom we expect the world week in and out, with the president by his side, lightening the mood a bit.

Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba named to FIFPro World XI,Danny Penza,"Jan 11, 2016, 12:50pm PST",This award is ridiculous,"Even Messi winning it is wrong. This award should be for individual stats of the last years, goals, assist and so on. And in that department, no doubt Ronaldo was better than Messi. I think he scored like 17 goals last CL and already has 11 in this seasons’ CL group stage. Also, in La Liga he has been more prolific than Messi and they have just about the same amount of assists. Then, IF they are judging by trophies won by a specific team, which is wrong because it’s an individual award, then why on Earth didn’t Sneijder win it in 2010? Don’t get me wrong here, I despise Inter very very, VERY, much, but the guy played a pivotal role in Inter’s triplete and also took Holland to a World Cup final. Also, I remember another year when Ronaldo was better with lots of more goals and so on, and again Messi won it. So it’s not even clear on what ground are they giving the award, is it the trophies (Sneijder?!) or personal stats – goals, assists and so on (C. Ronaldo 2011 or 2012 and 2015)?
And what pains me more is absence of Buffon. He was better than Neur both when it comes to trophies and CL finals and better on an individual level, and everyone knows that. Also, Sergio Ramos and Marcelo? MODRIĆ?! The guy was injured for like 5 months, didn’t even play. This award is so unfair that I can’t help but get mad.
My only explanation is that it is sponosored by Addidas. Messi is with Addidas and Ronaldo with Nike. Also, Neuer and Ramos and Modrić and Marcelo are all with Addidas, at least their teams are, for longer period than Juventus (who is just a few months with Addidas). My biggest proof on this Addidas theory is when Messi won the best player of the 2014 WC award. He was just average. He didn’t score a single goal after the group stage. Muller and Rodriguez were a lot better, just to name a few.
I stopped caring about these awards since I figured it was all fixed but I just can’t help but get angry when some Juve players don’t get nominated, above all Buffon and AT LEAST one of Chiellini, Bonucci or Barzagli.",VoxMediaUser3042082 ,"Jan 12, 2016 ", 12:47 AM,

I doubt messi/cr7 can play in defense or FB or CDM or GK and I doubt Buffon can play as a striker.
Tho awards are meaningless nowadays it used to be good as journalists used to vote for them, they at least watch all the players to form a much better opinion than coaches and captains.

This could be something happened with the FA of each respective country or somewhere within FIFA. This comes up every year and nothing ever happens.",cugino1897 ,"Jan 13, 2016 ", 8:23 AM,
Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba named to FIFPro World XI,Danny Penza,"Jan 11, 2016, 12:50pm PST",,As much as I loved Ribery that season and his team and him steamrolled everyone. His numbers if I remember correctly( someone can pull them f they want) were not really comparable at all to either of them. Like if it’s close team performance can matter. But I think I remember goals plus assists Ribery was still like 30 goal scoring plays from each of them. That’s a big number,nickdill40 ,"Jan 13, 2016 ", 9:01 AM,

I’m trying to understand the logic in this.
So winning the ""best player"" award is not about who won everything that past season but about who performs best as a footballer, right? So what’s the parameter of this, Goals? Assist? Overall contribution to the teams success? What? If this award is about who scored more goals then they may as well cancel the Golden Boot award altogether, and every player who aren’t strikers shouldn’t ever dream of winning it coz there will always someone who score more goals than them, they’re all doomed to fail.
Another thing to note is that, IF the best player comes from a team who won nothing, then what that says about his team mates? It’s like saying: ""Meh, I tried everything I could but the rest of my team sucks hard."" It doesn’t make any sense even more for players like… say… Ramos, Marcelo, and Modric to get inside a ""best XI"".
In the end of the day, This Ballon d’Or and FIFPro award are just popularity contests, and popularity contests are subjective, sometimes the winner deserves it such as Messi in this very moment, the other times they just don’t.",Linez ,"Jan 14, 2016 ", 4:26 AM,

I’m just saying that going solely by team success (or making it a primary requirement) is not really the way to go. I’m not even saying that it should really come down on who has the highest number in a certain category of statistics, that’s just a straw man.

I don’t see anything problematic with this? You can be a god in soccer AND have trash bags as teammates which render your ability to win anything. I don’t think that invalidates your individual ability as a player.",Division,"Jan 14, 2016 ", 6:24 AM,

Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba named to FIFPro World XI,Danny Penza,"Jan 11, 2016, 12:50pm PST","Okay, I misinterpreted that","But coming up with such parameter is hard in itself. I think it has been discussed ad nauseum that statistics play lesser roles in soccer compared to, say, baseball or basketball. Not to mention, as you mentioned previously, which stats should we use. Something like this should be done with combination of both stats AND eye-test. Ideally, voters should discuss with each other on who should be the best player. But voters have their own personal interests that discussions would be pointless anyway as most of them are set on their choices and can’t be swayed the other way.
I think our problems have been about who should have the right to vote. Having players and coaches vote introduce a considerable amount of nepotism. I didn’t pay much attention when that French magazine still held the full rights of this award, but apparently people liked it so maybe we should go back to that.
The second part I was talking more on those who are selected as the ""best XI"", how could you be inside seasons ""best XI"" if your club won nothing?
For me, FIFPro Best XI is about players who are best at their respective positions. So let’s consider an extreme case, in which Ramos is having a season of his life but his teammates suck. He has cut down a considerable amount of errors yet when errors do happen, they’re often fatal because the other defenders are so inept that they can’t compensate for his (rare) failures. Not to mention their strikers can’t score to save their lives. Combination of those factors contribute to his team not being able to finish in the top 5 in their domestic league and getting kicked out of UCL after the group phase. Does that invalidate his position as one of the best CB in that season, hence getting snubbed in FIFPro Best XI?",Division,"Jan 14, 2016 ", 5:18 PM,
Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba named to FIFPro World XI,Danny Penza,"Jan 11, 2016, 12:50pm PST",,"As reflected in the original post I am in full agreement with you.
History speaks for itself and this a fashion/beauty contest. Look at the votes for Bayern. Along with Barca – they are Juve’s most formidable obstacle to winning where and what matters the most. However, their ""contribution"" is negligible compared to the Real (or for that matter Barca).
