"Sampdoria vs. Juventus 2016: Final score 1-2, Bianconeri make it nine victories in a row with hard-fought away win",Johann Burnett,"Jan 10, 2016, 8:15pm PST",I know I'm going to get so much s**t for saying this but here it goes,"First let me say I love Buffon just like anyone else on here but it would be nice to see him TRY to make some saves every now and then. He was glued to his spot on 2 occasions during the match, 1 of which was the Cassano goal.
I know he probably knows he won’t reach it but am I the only one who thinks he should at least try? He has done this (or should I say hasn’t done anything) several times this season. Another time I can remember was the free kick goal Roma scored, not sure about the Sassuolo free kick goal.",JuveFanSam ,"Jan 10, 2016 ", 9:51 PM,

"Sampdoria vs. Juventus 2016: Final score 1-2, Bianconeri make it nine victories in a row with hard-fought away win",Johann Burnett,"Jan 10, 2016, 8:15pm PST",Good to know I wasnt the only one,"It really bugs me when keepers stand rooted to the spot, I rather they try even if they dont reach thats ok for me, they tried. like GB said he used to do this but this season I felt the fequency of him letting it go has increased. I felt at first I expected too much of Buffon considering his age now, so I didnt bring it up + every soccer fan is bias, criticizing the god of juventini in a juventus forum is a death sentence.
On FKs I felt both could hv been saved by Buffon, they was a reason the only FK he conceded last season was unorthodox one by Ilicic, our high wall (thx to heights of pogba and Llorente, this season pogba, mandzukic, khedira) makes it harder for players to curl it under the bar in time and if any reach there Buffon was always there.
This practice annoys me IRL too, so whenever there I play with my friends whether I am playing in midfield or defence I do the keeping on set pieces as I know half the time they will just let it go and not even try calling it unsaveable, to me a shot is unsaveable when you tried to reach there but failed, if not its just excuse. ofc cant compare this experience with professional soccer, so like GB said will just continue to trust buffon.",SJ_JUVE ,"Jan 10, 2016 ", 11:30 PM,

You can see that oftentimes when Buffon goes for a save and the ball curls or deflects or changes path in mid-air, he will simply retract his hand to avoid giving a dangerous rebound. I understand that you are talking about a different situation, just dive for the sake of diving.",JRob ,"Jan 11, 2016 ", 12:16 AM,

He’s completely 2 footed, has a keen eye for a pass, free kick specialist, and his defensive work rate isn’t terrible (but could be better)
only thing is Levy is one of the worst in the world to deal with. Especially when it comes to his best players. I don’t think there’s any chance we get him simply because when they decide to sell, we will not indulge in a bidding war.
So while he’s perfect for what we need, I don’t see any chance at all of landing him. That and he seems content as a big fish in a little pond.

Juventus 2 - Sampdoria 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Jan 10, 2016, 3:10pm PST",first half season thoughts,"- The game was good, we never really went all out it was in control. I was expecting meh January but it seems our winning streak has given players enough confidence that we are winning without getting out of second gear. Its all good and all but I feel a defeat is around the corner, which will help them push them into form. Hopefully it wont be against a title rival, in cup competition and we recover in time for Bayern game. Allegri has been very agitated lately going apeshit over lil things. Maybe he is under pressure of maintaining the longest winning streak of his career or maybe he too is expecting a defeat soon, no idea what he will do when we lose.
- IDK if it was just me but seeing the team play I had confidence the team will see the match thru and wasnt anxious like vs Carpi barring the period between the cassano goal and fernando shot the team was calm. They didnt lose their shit (maybe thx to Allegri going crazy). There was an air of confidence around them and they just knew they will not be beaten AGAIN. Its much more difficult to maintain that after conceding a goal especially since next one will be equalizer. The last minute play where Rugani shepherd Muriel out for corner and cheillini heading the ball heading for goal was great. My only complaint is they dont manage the possession in the last 5 mins or so well, we had so many chances to maintain possession but they just clear the ball, best example was after the tackle on Zaza which got the samp player sent off rather than keeping the ball playing among themselves or bringing it to the corner flag they just hit long which the samp defence got and the attacked again. Not sure if this Allegri’s instruction or they do it themselves.
- The team is developing very well, we are in cruise control now and they are amazing. When we reach peak we are going to be unplayable, I hope we peak right before Bayern game that will increase odds of winning. Pogba is starting to hit form now if Morata finds his form, pereyra comes back, Asamoah, caceres and khedira can stay fit and hopefully hernanes improves further with continue integration of Rugani we have a truly awesome team. Our rivals is definitely shitting bricks.
- Today’s Rugani was good, he keeps performing like this more and more game time will come towards him, with Barzagli reported out for 1 mth and Games coming thick and fast he and caceres both will get good share of time. Hernanes improved leap and bounds from his previous performance, yes his defensive contribution isnt as great as Marchisio and he is kind of defensive liability but he is more creative, when the team adapts to his style of play we will hv decent back up for Marchisio vs small teams. I really doubt we will get a new regista/CDM/deep lying playmaker in january so till summer he is good option provided this wasnt a fluke game and he can continue to perform AT THE VERY LEAST like this game.
- I hv been saying from preseason our main contender will be Napoli, they are definitely living up to the label tho they seem to be highly dependent on higuain who with Aguero is one of the biggest choker n the game. It remains to be seen whether Sarri has address the issue or like last season and the seasons before it creeps up towards the end of season. We hv advantage over Napoli as the team and the coach knows how to win and are used to the pressure unlike Sarri and Napoli + we have a deeper squad and hv having play 2 games a week from september we are used to it/getting used to it while for Napoli now will be true test as they will hv to field their top team in EL and Seria A no more 2nd team in EL.
- Inter, Fiorentina and MAYBE Roma will be fighting for 3rd spot it depends to be seen which one of them will win, I have a feeling it will be Fiorentina but its too hard to predict, one thing I am sure top two is Juventus and Napoli. YES just like beginning of the season I am very sure we will scudetto.
OT
- On the abv note seeing Berardi play vs Inter it was incredible to watch the understanding he and vrsaljko, if we really bring both of them in summer and hold on to our stars (Pogba, Dybala, Sandro, Zaza/Morata) and add those two I am VERY CERTAIN we will win UCL next season. No, I am not delusional. The current team has great potential which we havent reach yet and hopefully will reach by end of season adding the two missing cogs Vrsaljko and Berardi will allow us to play 4 man back line with a proper RB of Sandro lvl and another playmaker. Berardi has steadily improved over the past two season and is much more a team player, vs Inter it was very interesting to see a young player like him having the excellent off the ball movement which ends up creating a lot of space for sansone and vrsaljko and his passing his sublime. He was everywhere, I am definitely sure now he can play a free roaming SS like dybala so we can play with two SS supporting (one who tends to move center and the other drift wide) a ST. Other additions will depend on who leaves in summer.",SJ_JUVE ,"Jan 10, 2016 ", 7:42 PM,
Juventus 2 - Sampdoria 1: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Jan 10, 2016, 3:10pm PST",,"Max has typically been a calm and collected manager. He gives off a mentor/teacher-like vibe. he genuinely cares about his job and his team and players.
There are passionate teachers out there who can produce a serene learning environment conducive to development and building self-confidence in pupils. They can also exhibit tough love to push their students forward and prevent them from getting complacent. To keep good students progressing, you often need to challenge them more and gradually set expectations higher to keep them from stagnating.
In many ways I feel that Allegri does this with his team. I don’t mean this to be a Conte vs Allegri argument, but I would just like to make one observation of the contrast between the two managers’ styles.
Conte’s soldier-like method of constantly being in his players ears on the pitch and training ground rejuvenated (pun intended) this team and gave them a never-die attitude. In doing so for three straight years, it seemed the message, or perhaps more so, the regime worn thin and physically, and mentally exhausted the players and the coach himself.
Allegri, on the other hand, who is much calmer and cool-headed, even under pressure, seems like a manager whose methods could translate into a longer run of success. He exudes a quiet confidence, and although fans and critics may have questioned some of his personnel choices or tactical decisions early on, he always calmly explained his choices in a logical way. He handles the media well, and has a proven track record of nurturing and developing youngsters.
We have recently seen his ""wild side"" on the touch line with more frequency, considering that this team had to climb from 15th place to only 2 points from top spot. He understand that you can’t keep a team of champions only motivated to winning it all by just keeping things serene. He kept things calm when it seemed like everyone else was giving this team more flak than they deserved.
Now that he has navigated his ship through an early treacherous voyage and weathered the storm, he is sure to keep his team motivated to see this through to the end. We all saw how a few moments of complacency within a match (e.g. Carpi) can potentially derail our progress and undo all the good things this team has done since our loss to Sassuolo. Allegri sees this, and for that reason, he has raised his grinta to more visible and audible levels (insert DBZ meme here). He has that great blend of having a calming effect and being able to flip the switch and tell his players to get their collective head out of their ass when need be.",Nuncio#7 ,"Jan 10, 2016 ", 8:38 PM,

The way the team is playing with the Khedira/Marchisio/Pogba triumverate, and an in form La Joya, this team looks very dangerous. 27 points on the trot is indicative of one thing – resiliency. It’t not the same side that lost to Udinese and Roma in August, and drew against Chievo and Frosinone at home. Juve could put up 4 or 5 at the Matusa this time around, in fact I expect it.
This side could buzzsaw all the way unscathed to the rematch with Napoli (the one question mark being what side Max fields in the Coppa at the Olimpico).

If you watch the first half again you’ll see that Hernanes spent most of the time just inside their half next to Cassano while our back three had possession.
Cassano hovered close to Hernanes in between the back three and Hernanes trying to cut of his supply.
Hernanes meanwhile was just jogging back and forth doing a mediocre job of making himself available and Bonucci et al pretty much ignored Hernanes not giving him the ball instead playing it amongst themselves and Bonucci playing some long balls that he shouldn’t have.",Paolo C ,"Jan 11, 2016 ", 2:54 AM,

We can beat them but we will need luck. If we knock out Bayern we immediately become one of the favourites and every other team will fear us.
4) Knocking out Bayern will have no affect on our chances of signing Gotze and tbh their are better options out there. If I had a choice to sign one of Gotze or Berardi, I would choose Berardi.

People here were clamoring for Lippi and Montella, Jesus Christ, though I love this team and in general we have great fans. We have become super spoiled, clamoring for the firing of the manager that just delivered our most succesful run in over a decade and people wanted him gone because of a slow start.

his vision is nice, he takes the space he’s given, yet he’s scuffed some passes. But honestly what do u expect when it’s been so long since he last played a game

I’d roll out with:
(352)
Buffon
Martin – Leo – Giorgio
Caud – Sturaro – Sami – Pogba – Sandro
Dybala – Morata
Edit: Hmm… maybe throw Zaza in there for Morata but I’d rather him be ready off the bench in case of emergency.",Anthony Turgelis ,"Jan 9, 2016 ", 4:00 PM,
"Sampdoria vs. Juventus match preview: Time, TV schedule, and how to watch the Serie A",Danny Penza,"Jan 9, 2016, 3:15pm PST",Okay maybe this is time to go on my Morata rant,"I’m getting seriously annoyed about the majority of criticism of Morata as of late, seeing suggestions that he isn’t our future and that he should be our 4th striker and so on and so forth.
I totally agree that right now, at this point in time, Zaza and Mandzu are both in much better form than him, and they should continue to see minutes in the first team until their form goes back down.
What I don’t agree with is that Morata should just be disregarded until we’re in a position of emergency. This guy pretty much singlehandedly got us to the CL final last year because Tevez totally shut down on occasion in the CL last year (not to take anything away from Tevez, I love him and I’m forever grateful for his time at the club). Morata stepped up when he needed to most.
I totally understand the criticism of his game as of late, but it really seems like most of the suggestions are that he’s an inferior striker and we don’t really need him.
It just seems as of late that some people have a very short memory and are pretty much disregarding what he showed he could be last year. Let’s not forget that the guy is only 23 years old! He still needs minutes. He still needs to be part of the picture. He is still a HUGE part of our future if he chooses to be, and I will continue to back him. Because if you’re giving me the keys to Juventus and I need to pick one striker on this team for a 1 game CL final, I’m picking Morata every time, form aside.",Anthony Turgelis ,"Jan 9, 2016 ", 4:12 PM,

"Sampdoria vs. Juventus match preview: Time, TV schedule, and how to watch the Serie A",Danny Penza,"Jan 9, 2016, 3:15pm PST",I don't think he has the ability. Plus his lack of mobility is scary at times,"His best attributes to me are his ability to move into pockets of space to recieve forward balls, and his ability to make the correct decision once he recieved it there
I think for our team his most important job is to get the team up the field off the ball. He is the recipient of so many marchisio and bonucci long ground passes and he keeps it and distributes in a way that maintains our forward movement
In the few times he’s been tested as regista (just preseason) as well as when midfield positioning leads to him being the farthest back, I found him to be very ineffective in the position.
Sami is a player to me that needs to be able to make runs without the ball. It’s simply his greatest attribute. With his complete lack of any type of pace, if he made one run and we got countered on with him up the field, we’re toast.
At the same time, limiting Sami to staying back takes away his greatest attributes. Also when I’ve seen him there, he seems almost uncomfortable in metronome role on his own.
I hope that makes at least a little sense. I’m at work and kinda rushed my points. I wrote more in depth about my issues with Sami on one of the post game threads from Verona where I was proposing pogba play at regista

Maybe we do need to adapt by playing a 4-4-2 with two CMs when Marchisio is not there.

I know it sounds weird, but I believe that aying Hernanes might be less risky than playing Khedira. ..because at least we have gotten so we hat used to that system. A SKP midfield might field the better current players om the lineup, but it could also turn out as an unbalanced aberration.

- Rugani has not been integrated well with the squad yet
- With the absence of Marchisio and Sampdoria’s home form, starting with Rugani in such a difficult game may shatter the boy’s confidence if we don’t win
I am with starting Hernanes tomorrow. While I like Sturaro, I think Hernanes can distribute passes better and is better at attack.
I also want to see Sandro starting again, but if Evra starts, Cuadrado should start on the right flank as he provides a more attacking threat than Lichtsteiner.
Morata should start again tomorrow to regain his form. We already know that Zaza can spark the team coming off the bench so he should be introduced at 60-70 minute mark

He is a good player and the performances at the beginning of the season are not representative of his true performance.
I think he is being judged here because of his merda background and because people expected a younger, more talented TQ.
We are not a provincial team that hates a player just because of what club he plays/played for before.
His abysmal game was the one against Napoli, but the whole team was bad back then. The other bad performance is probably when he took a red card. The other performances were just average, when the whole team was playing badly anyways.
Hernanes deserves another chance. His skills has been proven on the pitch in Serie A and I hope he can show them tomorrow",mass19 ,"Jan 9, 2016 ", 11:52 PM,

Just every game Hernanes has played he’s looked genuinely very average to me.
Hopefully you’re right and he turns it around but even when we were playing better he still looked average to me eg Borussia M.
His control has been poor, he looks like he can lose possession any second, his passes put a lot of pressure on the person to whom he’s passing.
He has done some good things but overall he’s been really poor for me.
Even when we were playing badly guys like Lemina were still playing well.
Anyways, I’ll stop complaining about him for the moment but I just struggle to see positives from him so far this year and I don’t get the impression it will change.
I can only see him risking stopping our excellent positive form at the moment.",Paolo C ,"Jan 10, 2016 ", 12:23 AM,

Reports: Juventus 'on the verge' of acquiring Cesena midfielder Stefano Sensi,Danny Penza,"Jan 8, 2016, 3:10pm PST",That still creates the wrong movement.,"That still creates the wrong movement for one of them (likely Dybala). With the 4-3-2-1, the TQ’s can basically run forward or drift out – as cutting in puts them into two players almost immediately. So with the LF, Berardi would be able to move from right to left – putting him on his strong foot to shoot. Dybala would be moving from left to right, which puts him on his weak foot. Obviously it’s more fluid than that, but for both players to occupy the quasi-central space forces one of them onto a weak foot when they move out – and they can’t both move in the same direction, or else the’ve just congested the box.
I could see it working with one centrally and one on the right in a 4-3-3, but Morata is my question there. That’s not to say he can’t do it, but I just can’t remember any specific instances in which two inverted wingers worked with a SS. I know Barca tried it for a while with Neymar and Sanchez on the wings and Messi in the middle, but the games were very disconnected and relied on a lot of individual brilliance from the trio rather than spacing and teamwork (or, when it did rely on spacing and teamwork, stalled…a lot).
I’d be interested in seeing if Juve could bring in someone like Mkhitaryan. He can provide width on either side of the formation, which would allow Morata to play both centrally and on the wing, and would keep the 4-3-1-2 open as a possibility. Not saying it should happen, but I’m interested in the idea at least.",semperty ,"Jan 9, 2016 ", 12:58 AM,

Reports: Juventus 'on the verge' of acquiring Cesena midfielder Stefano Sensi,Danny Penza,"Jan 8, 2016, 3:10pm PST",Morata is definitely a physical presence.,"I’m not sure if (or how) the physicality on the wings would change things from the physicality in the middle, but it’s definitely an interesting counter. Perhaps there’s another team that’s run a comparable front three with success that I don’t know about, or perhaps it’s an innovative idea that Juve creates.
As for Messi – he did play centrally for a while. Under Pep, though, Barca always had a winger. It’s one of Pep’s core philosophies. The front line always consists of a winger, a CF, and an inverted winger. The only time I can think of that differed was the first trio under Pep. From there it was Villa (inverted winger), Messi (CF), and Pedro (winger on the right side) or Pedro, Messi, Sanchez. When the team did leave that philosophy and run a 4-3-3 with Messi as a CF and two inverted wingers the team stalled a lot. Teams parked the bus against us with a fair amount of ease, the offense relied on the individual brilliance of Messi, Sanchez, or Neymar.
I don’t want to say it was ugly (nothing Messi does is ever really ""ugly"" and Neymar’s a pretty special talent, too), but it wasn’t pretty. Teams just crammed guys into the box, because none of our wingers were really worth a damn when it came to providing width, and cramming guys into the box separated Messi from the other forwards – and occasionally the midfield. That peaked under Tata Martino – and from there we got another physical CF to create that space.",semperty ,"Jan 9, 2016 ", 1:05 AM,

And when he’s in front of goal, he doesn’t fucking waste it.
Morata is more of a build-up player, he’s more involved in the building up of the attack and you can see him on the sides a lot more, also his finishing isn’t as good as Zaza’s so he misses a lot of his chances.

I tend to agree with JD about Morata though. He’s not in great form, the other three are. There’s no harm in playing your in form players and Morata biding his time to ride out his poor form.
We should use our best in form players to win matches and where the opportunity is available use it to allow talented out of form players like Morata to get back in form just like we did today.
But Zaza is certainly staking his claim for a start although each he and Morata have their own value.

Personally, I’d flip the wing-backs and put MDS on the right and Darmian on the left. I know de Sciglio and Darmian typically play on the other wings with the Italian team, but I also know MDS started on the right flank and I believe Darmian started as a left-midfielder (though I don’t know that) – and I tend to like de Sciglio more on the right, and I haven’t noticed a huge difference of Darmian on either flank.
Also, I don’t know of any good CF’s for Italy. Maybe Vazquez as a false-9? I don’t know how much that’d work, but I definitely like the 3-4-3 for Italy’s squad. It gets the best defenders on the pitch, leaves the midfield to be run by Marchisio/Verratti, and provides to layers of width.

Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Hellas Verona,Danny Penza,"Jan 6, 2016, 4:35am PST",i agree,"he is a very good player and can effect the game in many different ways
saying hes a scorer only discount his ability as a passer (not bad for a forward he knows how to get rid of it and when) hold up man, which I guess also displays his passing and decision making. I think almost every game I’ve watched him he receives a ball to chest and knows exactly where morata/dybala is to get it to him one touch and then bust to the box for a return. It’s one his most noticeable attributes that he gets rid of the ball quickly and effectively when recieving a long ball to me.
then you go into his defensive abilities. negative would have to be his tackling. While he puts himself in great positions, he commits too many fouls and a lot can be bad and unnecessary. His overall pressing game though is fantastic. So much stamina, so much hustle. A little fine tuning in his defensive game overall and he would be more dangerous than mandzukic in that matter.",JuveSal8 ,"Jan 6, 2016 ", 9:50 AM,

I am not worried about Juve because we are not a selling club but the other Serie a teams will get decimated by the English money.",ForzaJuveGunnerz ,"Jan 6, 2016 ", 1:44 AM,

Report: Juventus rejects Crystal Palace's €27 million bid for Simone Zaza,Danny Penza,"Jan 6, 2016, 1:35am PST",,"Its pretty ridiculous to think that basically the entire PL will be in the Deloitte top 20 money league in the next two years. Basically Norwich (assuming they still will be in the PL) will have more money than Inter in two years. While this will mean a lot of Serie A clubs will struggle to keep hold of their star players as any English club will pay silly money for them, it also means that as a player, if you go to the PL you will never get out, as no club outside of it will be able to afford you despite how shitty you are.",Metal_Hummus ,"Jan 6, 2016 ", 5:44 AM,

I dont buy that crystal palace offered 27 mil as 1) their most expensive buy was just in summer and that was cabaye for ~12mil and now 6 mths later they have enough money to spend 27 FREAKING mil. I know english clubs are rich but I doubt they are THAT rich if they were they could hv spend it in summer and got someone good + now that they left 27mil worth Zaza they are moving to 11mil worth Babacar pretty huge drop off for backup buy.
Most likely IMO they offered ard 15mil or so for Zaza instead of 27mil, to me this whole fiasco is similar to the one like for Llorente where they were quoting very inflated figures.",SJ_JUVE ,"Jan 6, 2016 ", 4:16 AM,

I think it’s extremely important that on our return from the break, we have a home game first.

"Juventus vs. Hellas Verona match preview: Time, TV schedule, and how to watch the Serie A",Danny Penza,"Jan 5, 2016, 1:40pm PST",,"A must-win game: We’re three points behind Inter, and games after the breaks are always tricky no matter how easy/beatable the opposition is. It will be a great opportunity for Juve to pile some pressure on those in front of us on the table, by the same token it is a chance that shouldn’t be missed by Rugani and Alvaro to showcase their talent and convince Allegri they’re worthy of a spot in the starting 11.
Overall for the rest of the season, I think three things will play a significant role in defining Juve’s season:
1) Alvaro Morata regaining his last year’s form.
2) As good as Evra has been, Alex Sandro’s contribution in the attacking third is far better than his french counterpart. Allegri should start playing Alex in important games.
3) The inevitable return of Juve’s most underrated player—Pereyra. He will be very important, especially in Europe and against plucky defensive provincial teams that love to sit back when they face Juve.
