,"excellent, I thought all their games would be like this, a walk in the park. but I guess its a harder league then I thought it was.
that second goal from Balzaretti was meant to be a cross (you dont need me telling you that)

The third goal shouldnt have happened because we should have gotten the free kick that set up the goal in the first place. overall i was very disappointed in the lack of focus the defenders had putting buffon in trouble and exposing him to the other team…overall very poor result hopefully we will redeem ourselves tomorrow..as for trez its too bad that the comittee caught it lol,Sofia ,"Mar 12, 2007 ", 11:47 AM,

,"I think management will come through in terms of signing good players. This has been and will continue to be the case although I do share your frustration in terms of being underachievers when it comes to South American talent.
However, what I find more confusing is what management will do with all our youngsters. I think we have the best “class” of any of the last twenty or more years and definitely way better than any team in Italy including Roma. Some players are mature enough and should stay on board including Marchisio, Palladini, Paro, Criscito and Mirante. Not sure about the others. Loans are ok but all this talk about selling half a player or incuding De Cigle and Paro in a deal for Barzagli just drives me crazy.
The one player I heard many good things about but have not seen is Nocerino. My fellow colleagues on channel four’s marcello salas thread speak highly of him.

,"rossi82 i agree with you that selling our young players is a bad idea..however loaning them out may be for their (players) best interest as they would probably get more play time on a serie b team therefor building up their skills. i also feel that we should stick with our homegrown talent because like you said we have a lot of it especially with people calling Palladino the heir to Del Piero which is a pretty big tag to put on someone….i dont think that the management will let us down because we all want the and have the same goal—strengthen juve and be uber competitive next season in serie a. oh and i dont know how true this is but i heard that gigi buffon said he doesnt believe juve will be competitve for another 4-5 years.

,"Sofia. You are most welcome.
We call the forum Marcelo Salsa as well! it started as a typo!
All of this does not matter. We are back in Serie A. Right where we belong. A big win…I feel bad for Antonio Conte’s Arrezo but he is a champion so I hope Arrezo managed to stay in B. It has been a tough year and a pretty long one but the worst is out of the way.
As for Buffon, according to Channel 4’s football Italia, yes he did. He said that the worst is yet to come becasue it will hurt if we can not compete and he thinks we will not be able to. If he means what he said then chances are he will be out. This will hurt but Juve was never about a single player even Buffon. Amelia may well be the next big thing. Having said so, I hope Buffon stays. He stood by the team so no one will be engry if he leave unless he goes to inter, or as my wife likes to call them: Shinter!",rossi82 ,"May 19, 2007 ", 10:25 AM,

,"Ciao Gianfranco, I’ve recently found your Juve blog; as a fellow Juventino living in New York, I really appreciate your unique insight regarding the matches we’ve played (some of which were not broadcast on RAI international) and team news (especially your transfer market opinions). I’m also happy to hear that you’re a fellow Met fan, and I want to mention that I’m starting a new stadium chant for Jose Reyes. Currently we sing the “ole’ – ole’ ole’ ole’ World Cup chant”, changing the last ole’ to Jose. My new chant takes the Pavel Nedved chant, and reworks it to “Ole’ Jose Reyes – Reyes”… I hope you’ll be able to hear us on Friday. Forza Juve, and Let’s Go Mets!",Michael ,"May 10, 2007 ", 8:21 AM,
,"Well put Gianfranco. I have been a die hard juventino since 1982. In the process, I have witnessed many a sad campaigns by sorry Inter. What struck me each and every time as being shocking is how insecure this team is about its Italian identity such that they bid low for Italian players and high for foreign players. This, coupled with an endless list of excuses, phone tapping and cry-wolfs, have resulted in a serious case of lack of respect! they an enjoy their paper cup but yesterday’s thrashing by Roma should be a warning of things to come.",rossi82 ,"May 10, 2007 ", 11:58 AM,
,definately agree with you rossi82 i hate how inter run their campaigns with all these foreign players and then act like its nothing. i was dying of laughter when i found out what the roma-inter score was because inter got demolished….i just hope that roma can do it again next week just to make inter look bad haha,Sofia ,"May 10, 2007 ", 12:11 PM,
,"Actually, I seriously hope we are ready to compete next year. I tend to be optimistic but here are some reasons why we may prove competitive:
1. Next year’s competition will be very competitive. We will all start from zero. Bad news for Inter.
2. We are likely to bring Genoa and Napoli along with us!
3. We made Euro 42 million from players’ sales last year.
4. We have over Euro 70 million allocated for next year.
Now, I realize we lost serious revenues through our demotion but am sure a good chunk of money will be allocated to bringing good players on board.
Now, WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE NOT BRING BACK MARESCA! WE STILL OWN HIM.
Also, I pray that Palladino, Marcisio and Paro will stay with us. If anything, we should not sell them. Loan would do.",rossi82 ,"May 14, 2007 ", 11:15 AM,
,"well I’m with you on the Anelka thing no don’t want him anywhere near Juve. but hmmm Guily is a good one if it’s true. been watching him this season at Barca and he does do an impressive job but he’s mainly been coming in as a sub. Silva I like but I have adopted the wait and see mantra because Juve has been connected to almost everyone under the sun so far and this summer should prove to be an interesting one for Juve.

,"Giannicheda + Zanetti … OUT, i’ve never really seen what’s so great about them, very ‘average’ players and i’d rather have paro + marchisio as our backups or one of them and Zanetti as average players cannot make up the backbone of a Juventus side. I’d love to see a Milito/Barzagli defense, however unlikely. I think our right back position is slightly weak atm. We’re also linked with Pepe from Porto who has impressed this season. Alternatively we could push Grygera out to the right, with Chiellini in the centre (where he was VERY impressive playing in the U21 championships) with whoever we sign for Centre back, with someone like Nocerino out on the left? just suggestions…. lol",Gianluca Stoppani ,"Jun 27, 2007 ", 1:12 PM,

,"Hello!
This is a really great blogg. Now to answer your questions. First of all I would prefer to play a 4-3-1-2 formation to balance out the middfield which in my point of view looks a bit to offensive. Like this:
Buffon
Salihamidzic, Grygera, Pepe, Chiellini
Tiago, Zanetti, Almiron
Nedved
Trezeguet, Del Piero
Miccoli, Blasi and Tacchinardi has been called back. That strengthen the middfield and attack. Or what do you think about:
-Iaquinta
-Del Piero
-Trezeguet
-Miccoli
-Palladino
I’ve heard that Zalayeta wont be a Juventini at the end of the mercato so Im not counting him in.
The defence is not that good really. Im hoping for 2 new great central defenders with Chiellini och Sali on the flanks. Milito-Pepe? Barzagli-Pepe? Barzagli-Milito? Or maybe using the new star Criscito?
Juve got the money its just about getting the players. Kapo has been sold now to Birmingham so him we can forget. Now there’s romours going around about Lampard and Riquelme so we will se how it goes. We must be patient and wait untill the Mercato closes and then we can discuss if Juventus has the squad to take om the scudetto or not. But right now I can say that we at least will finish Top 4.

But Maggio had a break out season, and now you have Zeigler from start to finish so the attack will build up a lot on the wings with those two who I realy like, but Cassano is the key.

Nothing to fret about as the team created many chances and I would think that further down the line, as they get used to each other, are a little more fit and sharp in front of goal, they should do well. Almiron is a class player and I think Tiago too although he still needs to get used to his new surrounding.
I am still concerned about defence though. Zebina is particular still has those moments of lack of concentration and his side of the field was clearly the eakest today.
Too early to tell – Newcastle are ten days away from the start of the season while we are a month away. So the two teams were not at equal footing in terms of their preparations…",rossi82 ,"Jul 29, 2007 ", 11:28 AM,

Concerning Juve, I was pleasantly surprised to finally see the Bianconeri pick it up, after the less-than-brilliant performances in the UK and the Birra Moretti trophy.

,"I wouldn’t get too excited yet Roby, it was only Reggina that the Bianconeri were facing. Agreed, we got a lot of nice surprises from players who weren’t exactly performing to expectations. You quoted some of them, I’ll add my 2 cents:
Legrottaglie: From what I’ve read, he’s improved a lot these last few seasons. He seemed like a really promising youngster when Juve bought him (was playing amazing with Chievo and even scored a goal with the Azzurri at the time). After he came to Juve though he turned into a big flop, causing goals and leaks everywhere, which caused the ‘Old Lady’ to ship him off into 4 years of loan deals. But he’s back now, and I was happy at his defensive work Sunday. His goal was a bonus, so let’s hope he keeps this up and that we don’t regret Andrade too much.
Criscito: With Juve’s limited resources in defense, it’s a real joy to see this youngster developing so quickly. Getting a starting lineup spot even in a team such as this one (plagued by injuries at the back) is no easy feat. If Ranieri’s putting his faith into Criscito it’s because he sees the kid’s got talent, and I can only agree. He got schooled by Totti against Roma last week-end (regardless of the offside position), but that’s just inexperience. He just needs to grow, and he’s on the right track.
Tiago: I didn’t watch the game attentively enough (I had it on streaming while I was flicking between Palermo-Milan and Fiorentina-Roma on FSC/TLN), but I’m really glad that the Portuguese midfielder played well. It seems that he’s on the way back to the player we bought (the one doing wonders at Lyon), not the player we saw in pre-season.
Salihamidzic: Another pre-season flop. Bad passing, bad placement, a lot of doubts. Then he played a really good game as a right-back (don’t remember against whom, but it was Serie A) and then got injured. But from what I saw Sunday, he played really well, hussling after the ball, and deservedly scored a goal. Way to go. For a player than can transform into a right-back as an emergency, it’s one of the few luxuries Juve have left (considering the state of the defense).
Nocerino: An amazing pre-season, which made me fall in love with him instantly. Then a horrible game against Udinese, balls gifted to the opposition, etc. (but in his defence, that was a game in which everyone played badly). However against Reggina: nice plays and a beautiful deep pass for Palladino’s goal (I almost though that was Nedved the pass so good). The lad’s got heart, Juve need to mold him while they still have time.
Palladino: Speed, agility, ball control, and good finish, these are the trademarks of Raffaele. The future of Juve undoubtedly, but he’s still too inexperienced to be given a starting role. Although, with the fact that the Bianconeri have only 4 strikers this season (how stupid was it to sell Miccoli huh?), he’ll sure get a big chunk of playing time (also because Capitan Del Piero just can’t hold a full 90 minutes anymore).",Marco ,"Sep 27, 2007 ", 8:27 PM,

I am planning a trip to Italy in late April from the states to see some matches. A few of which will be in torino. The problem is that i need to be certain of match days. I was in Italy last spring and was shocked at how many matches were changed from saturday to sunday or sunday to monday.
Is there anyone or any website that could provide me with accurate match day forecasts. This is important to me because i need to be exact with my planning.
I really would appreciate any help! Thanks!

,"I don’t get this. What’s the point? If you want to be fully accurate and truly lay claim to an objective argument, why not put Juventus on this list for robbing calcio for years of its integrity? Or how about for clearly rigging transfers? Which to this day still impacts the league, and not only impacted Juventus opponents, but the entire league. Or for only being forced to spend one season in Serie B when their illegal activities were spread out over a larger frame of time?
The only “travesty” here is that Juventus is still allowed in Serie A; any fan who thinks otherwise is simply ignorant, arrogant, or flat out stupid. Likely all three.
And this isn’t a personal vendetta against you or Juve. My family was from the area. I “sympathized” with Juventus pre-Calciopoli, or I never hated them to the extent that most did, but call a spade a spade. If this is the worst thing that happens to Juve, then the true scandal is just that. It was an embarrassment to a country and a sport and they never paid the price. You can’t lose championships you never won.
And this: “Juventus is fiercly loved by it’s fans”…then why the fuck don’t they ever show up?
If I was a Juve fan, I’d realize how grateful I should be that I’m being allowed to watch my team play Inter, Roma, Milan and Napoli instead of Mantova, Pisa and Brescia, and sit quietly in the corner until enough time has passed where this could almost, maybe become a legitimate gripe.

Right.
Of course those penalty calls were awful, nobody can deny that. You got screwed and that’s unquestionable, and the ref should be taken to task for it. But don’t tell me you weren’t looking for the opportunity to be morally righteous, since god knows you’ve never had a fair chance to relish that feeling before.

Ranieri prefers two holding midfielders just like Capello (Emerson/Vieira) only we use Zanetti and Nocerino. I’m not a fan, it pretty much limits attacking through the wings, which you can tell from this year, we don’t have any real passes up the middle, except when Tiago plays. Considering some of the midfielders we may buy, Almiron doesn’t have much time left. He’s been a disaster the few times he’s played, unlike Tiago who has been excellent (I can’t believe he hasn’t gotten more time) so he better rediscover his form soon.

Looks like the late Fachetti was the one calling referees the most and that the three supposedly fixed matches were not fixed as evidenced by the reinstatement of the relevant referees last month! our management needs to have balls. A number of Juve supporters have written to the head of the football association to reopen the investigation and the letters are pouring in.
12 Juve players in the world cup winning campaign. Tell me people – did we need help to win the scudetto!! We are now third with a budget that is one tenth of that of Inter.
Putting this aside, I would like to see Juve sign a big big name…we used to do it so why can’t we now…remember Platini, Zaidan, Nedved and Baggio…we can do this as well as all the other clubs. I also hope to see Van Der Vaart and more of our loaned youngsters especially Marchisio and Giovinco..

I just thank the football gods for the fact that A) Juve signed Gigi back in the day and B) have managed to hold on to him. he has been the savior of Juve many a time this season, especially when our defense falls asleep. I just wish our backline didn’t have the confidence knowing Gigi is back there, then they might actually work harder. all in all a win is a win and now we are a point behind Roma and 8 behind Inter. not bad for a team who was playing in Serie B last season.",Jina ,"Dec 17, 2007 ", 2:49 PM,

,"M, Sofia, I’m glad you both liked the report- as much as it’s message didn’t do wonders for instilling a lot of happiness. However, to quickly answer your question M (Whether Juventus is really a title contender this season) I genuinely believe we are. You see, with Juventus not having any European responsibilities this year I think we’re more then capable given the roster we have now to keep pace with Inter. We’ve proved it in our fixtures against Roma, Fiorentina, Milan, and Inter (Udinese was a mess but w/e).
If the season ended next week, obviously being eight back off of the lead we wouldn’t contend for jack in the Serie A race. But, with 22 rounds left, Inter and Roma’s CL intentions, and the historical trends that reflect a domestic league slip (i.e. Milan 06-07, Liverpool 04-05) caused by the large physical strain, Juventus of course has a shot at the scudetto.
Forget the January transfer window, forget the thrashing of Palermo, those derby draws or our dismal defeats. I believe Ranieri’s instilling a level of consistencey that will see us challenge for the top spot come May next year.
That’s about as semi-rational as I can get hahaha",roberto ,"Dec 17, 2007 ", 4:48 PM,

Also: Ranieri is a pimp, pure and simple, I’m just sorry you people got him.
Inter are going to swoon in the second half, it’s just a question of who’s there ready to make a challenge. Given how well they’ve coped with horrific injury problems, I’m not sure it’ll be an issue of being spread too thin (thanks to CL play), but they’re going to stop concentrating at some point, I’m sure of it.

Rafa tried playing him with Mascherano a few times which was a bad idea, and he had a bad few games during that period.
Physically, he is enormous and should do better in that role than Nocerino. Nocerino has been real disappointing lately. Him and Zanetti could actually form a great partnership.

T-Rez couldn’t have made his feelings any clearer as his face paused in celebration to give Nocerino a “what the fuck are you doing here?”. Speaking of Nocerino, in addition to being semi-prone to turnovers, he cannot and I repeat CANNOT cross a ball into our area with any consistency yet and this is proving to be a pain my ass. If only we can just fucking clone Zanetti.
Ricci- I’m kind of getting the sense from what I’ve been reading about Stendardo that he is definitely gonna give us a boost in defense. Being 190cm doesn’t hurt either. If he’s ready to go at centre-back this Wednesday I’d expect Ranieri to give him the start in the middle with Lego. Then Grygera can move to his natural position on the right and Molinaro can have at the left again. Also, Birindelli needs to sit the next couple rounds out since he’ll be needed for this weekend’s match against Cagliari… we are fucked for that game come to think it. Nocerino and Zanetti are both suspended I think.
You know what ppl, put the 11 million and change aside for a second because Sissoko could hypothetically flourish in Ranieri’s system. I say we give the kid another chance here at Juventus with Ranieri. Alessio, I agree with you 100%. ADP is the only one bridging that gap, and being a defensive midfielder, I won’t expect Sissoko to help in that department. However, come summer, with sissoko or not, we’re still going to need to get someone special right? i.e.(VDV/DIEGO/DECO/BALLACK ETC). So really, since this summer seems to be the only time when we can make those blockbusters, I can almost semi-rationalise this decision.
FUCK IT, Sissoko WILL impress. I’m officially jumping on the bandwagon!

Amauri for Palladino…. shit, i dont know about that one. If we’re comparing them in their natural positions as strikers I’d rather have Amauri on Juventus. That said though, Ranieri prefers to use Palladino on the right as a winger (seeing as T-rez, ADP, and Iaquinta are rightfully his first options at ST), and so far (like against Livorno) Palladino has worked nicely. So, since we need more of a winger than a ST right now, I’d probably stick with Palladino.

It’s a shame Tiago is not working out here. Unlike Almiron (AND SISSOKO) he’s proven to be excellent in the past, he had a decent tenure at Chelsea, and a terrific one at Lyon. (Including Benfica, and WC’06) I guess he just doesn’t click with Italian football, or Ranieri’s formation.
I for one, however, would not be surprised if Salihamidzic played as a fullback. He has in the past, and though in midfield he doesn’t defend a lot, this would dedicate his role. If you watched against Empoli, Birindelli was just getting beaten and beaten again on the wings. He was responsible for at least one of the goals. Boumsong, thank god, will not be playing. That man scared the shit out of me everytime he was there, how many times was he beaten at Empoli? Falling down, losing his man in the box, it was like watching him at Newcastle all over again.

Buffon
Salihamidzic- Legrottaglie-Grygera- Molinaro
Marchionni- Zanetti- Nedved
ADP
Trez-Iaquinta

As for the lineup, i think Ranieri will end up going with Marco’s lineup because its stable for the most part. i am surprsied ranieri even called Tiago up the little bastard but i guess he had to – just in case. we also called up 3 kids from the Primavera who are apparently really good so we will see if they get any face time….",sofia ,"Jan 23, 2008 ", 7:45 AM,

,"dumb question, but, how does the loan system work? is it comparable to anything in the big 4 U.S. Sports?",R.J. ,"Jan 7, 2008 ", 7:30 PM,
,"RJ, a loan is when team B borrows a player from team A for a set amount of time. (usually a season or half a season.) The player plays for team B and is payed by them. After the period is over, the player goes back to team A. Note: The loaned player cannot play against the team it was loaned from.
 Comparing it to anything American is impossible because this idea is nonexistant in their sports. The closest thing I can think of is when a player is traded during the trade deadline but returns to the team is traded from the next season. For example, Doug Weight was from the Blues to the Hurricanes at the trade deadline. After the season was over, he resigned with the Blues. This is different, but the easiest thing to compare it to. Hopefully, that wasnt too confusing.",Allesandro ,"Jan 8, 2008 ", 11:26 AM,
,"R.J. i’m trying to think of an example where some loan-ish thing happens in the States & Canada. The only example I can come up with is the farm leagues those big NHL and MLB teams use for youngsters. In theory, those first teams who own a players rights send them back to Triple ‘A’ or their farm team just for more reps. But, the difference I find with soccer is that the first team can (ie Juve, Man U, Barca) loan their players out on contractual agreements to completely foreign teams/leagues whilst still owning their rights.

,"Foreign referees would be fine with me. Many of the current refs are new, and Collina urges “patience.” Honestly though, considering the correlation of Inter and Juve’s stark differences in penalty decisions, I don’t think it’s inexperience. I’m not yet ready to accept the idea of a fullblown conspiracy, but it’s not chance. I’m surprised teams like Reggina and Milan, who both also have been screwed a la Juve haven’t been complaining more, especially if Reggina gets relegated.
Foreign refs are fine, but I don’t like video replay. Yes, it could be introduced well, but I just don’t like the idea of it in football, at least. Some opponents say it’d waste too much time, like the NFL. That’s not true, as the NHL reviews each goal without stopping the clock, doable. I just don’t like the idea.
I think Platini may have the right solution. He’s trying to get two referees added to each penalty area to assist in offsides, goals, and more importantly, penalty decisions. I’ve refereed, and it is hard to tell wtf is going on in the box sometimes. Someone who’s exclusively watching for that kind of thing I think would help a lot. It should be mandatory for the main referee to consult the goal-line referee if he makes a penalty decision, and while he could still overrule the goalline ref, I think it would cut down a lot on incidents. I think it’s the best way to go forward.
And best of all, Platini has said these referees would be experienced referees who had had to retire at 45. No idiots in the box.",Alessio ,"Feb 28, 2008 ", 10:57 AM,

If want herky jerky sports I will watch Milan lately or baseball. The diving and stuff does take away from the game but a great remedy for that would be to have the refs of the same game be able to go back and issue post match cautions or in some cases suspensions. The beauty of sport is that it is not 100% accurate and the human aspect is what makes it great, but is does not mean that technology cannot be implemented to remedy certain aspect. The goal line camera, very useful in hockey, would be work as well and I believe is a great idea.

I would say, though, that problems with real people refs are part of the game and always have been, it is just that in 1952 (or 1910) there was not the technology that we have today to scrutinize every move of every player and second-guess every ref call.
I say, yes, be patient. Refereeing is a difficult and thankless task – especially in Italy where they are thought to be either inept or corrupt most of the time.

Football by nature is a flowing sport and for video footage to be used as “official evidence” would change the game on the pitch and off of it. Would the ref review every play? Only controversial ones? What if he was wrong about a call that he didn’t deem controversial enough? Would video evidence expire, or you could you use it months or a year after the game took place?

MikeDG your argument is well said. “Would the ref review every play? Only controversial ones? What if he was wrong about a call that he didn’t deem controversial enough?”
It seems implementing the video replay system would certainly open a Pandora’s Box-like set of issues themselves. However, it looks like the NFL have found a good way to implement it. In the NFL they mostly only review a play if the coaches themselves ask for it or unless it’s a very very close call. If Fifa gives the reviewable option to the coaches only, they can take away one of their three substitutions available if the coaches are found to be incorrect by the ref’s review.
Naturally then, the coaches are only going to choose to review a very small percentage of plays in the game that will constitute momentum swinging outcome.
Let’s say if Fifa were to allow one video reviewable play, per half, per coach.
if wrong: he’s charged one of three sub options.
if right: he’s awarded the appealed play (not given an extra sub)",roberto ,"Feb 28, 2008 ", 1:18 PM,

Let’s say teams can challenge 1 or 2 calls / match if it resulted only in a goal, a red card, a penalty or violent misconduct (eg head butting that the ref hasnt seen).

Really, it is only the reaction to the referees and the attitude toward them that is different between the leagues. How much of this “referee crisis” is born of the Italian love of conspiracies and mistrust of authority? That is, how much of this is cultural and how much is factual?
I am not saying there are no mistaken calls in England. I remember one instance where a referee made a public apology the day after a disputed red card was given. It happens.

I think the solution of having an additional two referees, dedicated exclusively to monitor what happens inside the penalty box, is a better one.
As for the foreign refs idea, despite the horrors we have seen this season I think Italy still has the best referees in Europe. Certainly not this year, but over the past decade. Besides, who would we pick to officiate the Serie A? Aside from Markus Merk, there isn’t anyone I find particularly excellent in Europe, but that’s just me.

But if it will be only used to decide goals and penalties in less than 30 seconds or so by a panel of judges in the game and will give the decision straight to the referee, then i dont know, thats a maybe.

If it’s not obvious in that time let the ref decide. Nothing will be affected but accuracy.
It’s definitely a lot better than costing teams important objectives and thus a ton of money. Imagine a team was relegated because of a horrible decision. All their players will leave, they won’t have money to replace them, and they’ll stay in Serie B for a while.

Pay the refs a higher salary so it can be their full-time job instead of this part-time crap. Meanwhile, teach these fucking guys the game meticulously inside a boot camp-esc environment.

,"Hey there folks! Im actually from the Milan pages, i heard u guys were having a mighty discussion so i thought i would throw my hat in the ring. (Be warned, its a large hat!)
The idea of having foreign refs misses a major fact, and that happens to be that across the world, the style of football differs ever so slightly from country to country.
Im in Scotland and grew up watching Scottish teams such as Rangers and Celtic, and also followed the EPL. These guys play a slightly more physical game than some of their European counterparts (Gattuso aside!) and as a result the refs tolerate a harsher level of physical contact. These refs may not be tolerated by calcio tifosi should they be flown over there to officate.
Im not sure that a ref from one country would be able to fully appreciate the nuances in the style of play in another league.
If any of u guys (or gals) watched the recent African Cup of Nations then you may have noticed that of all the matches played, there was possibly only one or two matches played that resulted in a nil-nil result. The teams were very good to watch as they all wanted to attack but some lacked the tactical need to defend (hence the very high goal count) and some of the tackles made ME wince.
It is generally agreed that the leagues in Spain & Italy are considered to be alot more technically proficient (you just have to look at the list of winners of CL and UEFA comps) than alot of other nations espec. in europe and the refs should be home grown regardless of country.
I do however agree with using video replays in football, especially for divers and even more, where a player fakes an injury (that REALLY pisses me off) when a guy hits the deck clutching his face etc, imagine being the player who gets red carded when you’ve not even touched the guy and he’s now on the ground screaming!! I think that the replays should be used for dubious goal clearances as well as shady offsides! (Even though this might make life harder for Super Pippo!)
As for wether or not the replays would kill the flow of the game, again, i cast doubt, as i have watched many a match where players are falling down faking or the ref breaks up the flow. But this is always usually made up for with added on time, the technology is at such a level now where the distruption could be minimised.
How many times have you seen a ref play advantage and then later go back and pick up a player for an incident? The same could be done with video replays no?
I done think we as tifosi should turn in on ourselves either, yes we’ve had a blow, but winning a world cup and the high number of italain teams in CL finals still says alot to the world, even though im not italian, i was sooooo proud to see the Azzuri lift that trophy, it was the perfect middle finger to the doubters imo.
Someone will have to correct me but im sure, that when Jaap Stam was sold to Lazio he was instantly caught out by a drugs test having literatly stepped off the plane from Manchester but i dont remember any of the press making anything out of it.
Anyone remember?",Avia ,"Feb 29, 2008 ", 3:39 PM,
,"I think Daniele is right: neither the fans nor the players should have to put up with shitty refereeing. Ever. And IMO, this campionato has turned into something between a farce and a soap opera. I don’t know that foreign refs would really make that much of a difference though because they’d still be paid from the same pot of cash as the Italian refs. Regardless of whether or not anything dodgy is actually going on behind the scenes, when a football federation’s biggest sponsor is also the primary source of cash and a major shareholder in one of the teams fighting to win that championship, it is an incredible conflict of interest that needs to be axed ASAP.
The FIGC and the AIA need to be independent bodies, and ideally, impartial ones. I think that if the FIGC really wants to clean up their shop, they should start with the accounting department and completely revamp how and from whom they receive sponsorship dollars. Perhaps putting a cap on the amount of money any one particular group is allowed to plug into their system?? It’s like a politician taking money from a lobby group. Even the superficial appearance of being in someone’s back pocket can be incredibly damaging to public perception. And when you combine this with the Italian culture of rampant conspiracy theories it’s a recipe for chaos – as this season bears witness.
Certainly more referee training is required and since human error is always going to happen, I like the idea of another official in the box and quite like the idea of video replay as well. It works in the NHL because they don’t stop to dissect every single play and so the flow of the game isn’t damaged. In fact, in most hockey games I’ve watched they rarely bother going upstairs for the second opinion – it’s just available if and when needed. But I still think these measures really only scratch at the surface of a problem that goes way beyond calico in Italian society.

Dura presa di posizione degli arbitri che, accusati da media e giocatori, sono ora pronti a incrociare le braccia e a dar vita a un clamoroso sciopero. Stando infatti a quanto rivelato da persone vicine all’ambiente, nel corso dell’ultima riunione a Coverciano, le giacchette nere, capeggiate da Farina e Rosetti, i colleghi più rappresentativi, avrebbero sottoposto al designatore Collina e al presidente dell’Aia Gussoni un’ipotesi di agitazione, da attuarsi nel caso di ulteriori attacchi mediatici.
In particolare gli arbitri avrebbero ipotizzato due forme di protesta: fermarsi e non scendere in campo o cominciare tutte le gare di campionato con 15’ di ritardo. La decisione definitiva verrà comunque presa nella riunione del prossimo 13 marzo. Se la linea dello sciopero dovesse effettivamente passare, la nona giornata di ritorno sarebbe dunque a rischio.
Because of all the attention to the referee calls recently, the refs are considering a strike. They will make a decision March 13. It may simply be that games will start 15 minutes late in one game, or they may not work on the ninth day of the return part of the season. (I guess that would be week 28, March 16)

Juve were all over them we just werent doing anything with our possession. The officiating was shit at best, there was the CLEARRRR take down of Nedved, I believe, in the first half where the defender was basically strangling him before pulling him down, then there was the knee in on Sissoko, and then the BLANTENT pk just before Sissoko decided to pull a genius move on us all. I mean sure he meant to get the ball but he should know that a boot that high right in front of an obviously bias ref was not going to end well.
It really upsets me when people say how much Juve cheat, etc. and then we have games like these where the refs are so obviously bias toward the other team its incredible. Collina has to really get on this because the season would be COMPLETELY different if the refs were half decent. Its too bad, overall, some of our team showed up and some didnt. I think camo had one hell of a game especially since his back hasnt been 100% and chiellini wasnt too bad, palla was nearly invisible for most of the first and bits of the second unfortunately, ADP was ever present in the second as was Nedved. Sissoko, im a bit bias because i never really liked him so i blame him for this and secco of course for signing him.

 A seguito degli eventi sportivi di ieri sera sabato 23/02/08 con riferimento alla partita Reggina-Juventus,io tifoso juventino scrivo questa mia per dare un senso a quanto sta accadendo e soprattutto con l’intenzione nel mio piccolo di bloccare sul nascere anzi sul crescere quelle che sono le possibili reazioni smisurate e di natura “non civile”che si lo stato di cose attuale sta facendo “montare”,proponendo una linea di reazione consona a quello che è e deve rimanere lo stile di questa squadra la Juventus e dei suoi tifosi,abbandonando quei tifosi facinorosi negli stadi pronti a fare chissà cosa!In un frangente politico quale quello attuale noi siamo un popolo ai margini fanalino di coda europeo per quanto riguardala politica e dunque l’economia ed infine il sociale,una delle valvole di sfogo che ci resta per rilassarci un pò dopo gli affetti,molto dopo gli affetti lo sottolineo è lo sport….nel mio caso il calcio!Questa mia è proprio rivolta a tutti quanti credono che io come tutti gli altri appassionati del calcio siano lo stereotipo dell’italiano medio ossia quello che si spezza la schiena per lavorare e rifugge lo stress seguendo 25 persone in mutande che corrono dietro ad una palla…subendo passivamente dalle tribune ed ancora peggio dalla televisione quel che accade pagando per di più e non avendo voce in capitolo……,ci ho riflettuto a lungo sul concetto e sono arrivato al punto di capire che forse è così in parte ma non del tutto!Subire passivamente quanto accade questo no credo che noi abbiamo le carte per poter invertire la rotta…se è vero che siamo tanti ,oltre i dieci milioni di simpatizzanti/tifosi bianconeri (ma sicuramente la somma dei tifosi di inter e milan) noi abbiamo il dovere di restituire qualcosa a questa squadra che ci ha dato tanto tantissimo e a cui in questi due anni non possiamo rimproverare nulla giocano fino all’ultimo alito di forza;partendo dal presupposto che abbiamo pagato un condanna che ancora non è stata provata ma comunque abbiamo pagato:noi diciamo ORA BASTA!
Noi chiediamo agli organi competenti di giustizia sportiva e non( soprattutto),che venga fatta luce vera su quanto sta accadendo e che non può in nessuna maniera far parte di casualità ,errori o sviste è stato palese soprattutto in 4 gare quest’anno quella di ieri sera è solo la punta di questo iceberg,da parte nostra e questo è un appello a tutti i tifosi che seguono la squadra in tv e stadi a comportarsi in modi consoni e invece ci si potrebbe organizzare nel boicottaggio regolare del ""SISTEMA""bloccando gli introiti dei colossi tv qualunque essi siano ovviamente rinunciando agli abbonamenti ove possibile o almeno evitare di visionare le partite,soprattutto di non acquistare partite,evitare gli stadi questo perchè noi abbiamo UN POTERE ECONOMICO IMMENSO visto il nostro numero,l’unione fa la forza!Vorrei organizzare infine con un avvocato in gamba un piano per far rispettare i Nostri diritti di consumatori e per essere risarcito/i di danni fisici(mi è venuto il mal di fegato),morali(sto sempre di cattivo umore) e materiali(spendo/spendiamo soldi per vedere le partite allo stadio e d in tv,oltrechè c’è chi scommette legalmente e si sente defraudato) ed esistenziali nei confronti della FIGC,del designatore arbitrale COLLINA e degli arbitri che hanno sbagliato.
Visto che chi sbaglia paga deve pagare :
1) paghi la FIGC per non aver saputo risistemare le cose dopo Calciopoli e durante Calciopoli ,per non aver fatto nulla di fatto per bloccare questo stato di cose ancora oggi;
2)il tanto acclamato Collina che a parere di tutti non mi sembra abbia fatto il miracolo e che deve spiegare tante cose perchè errare è umano ma perseverare diabolicum est ,per cui COLLINA restituisca il lauto ingaggio di salvatore della patria e corrrisponda a noi quanto dovuto per le Nostre sofferenze(non esageriamo)
3)quegli arbitri che stanno sbagliando dimostrano di non essere diversi dagli altri per cui se non sono partecipi a frodi sportive,devono essere RADIATI senza appello alcuno.
In ultimo se non bastasse INVITO tutti a non acquistare i giornali sportivi
Questo è quanto, più siamo e più facciamo male se si fa una causa congiunta gli mettiamo paura potremmo fare un record da guinness,e fare la voce grossastavolta i primati(scimmie) sarete Voi dei poteri forti…iniziamo questo braccio di ferro che avete cominciato VOI!
Queste non sono le farneticazioni di un folle ma di uno che si è stufato di"" farsi prendere per i fondelli"" qui indulti non ci sono e chi ha pagato ,ha pagato e siamo stai solo noi(è da vedere ancora se a torto o a ragione) visto che è dimostrato che quando si muove la juve godono tutti per gli introiti tv stadio ecc ecc..ORA NOI CHE SIAMO L’ORIGINE DI QUEGLI INTROITI DICIAMO BASTA!

If you had to sum up his comment, you would obviously have to say he agrees with Ranieri’s post-game assertion that this display was only the “tip of the iceberg” so to speak. Marco is admirably trying to start an internet/blog movement where us Juventini are to stand up for our beloved club in the face of us this mess and say “enough is enough”. As Juventus STILL has by far the largest Italian fan base, and perhaps the world, he proposes a united boycott of all radio, tv, etc. sports journal outlets. He believes that in the absence of our club’s massive following, there will be an economic loss so great that the ‘powers that be’ (referring to those who orchestrated calciopoli against Juventus) will loss the only thing they ever cared for really… money.
Your Thoughts?
Ahhh I love the support we Juventini have for our club but more importantly, the support we have for eachother. It’s in tough times like these where our spirit is shown. Recently however, our nerves, character, commitment, and disposition in general as a Juventini have been tested more than ever. Marco’s plan (whether you support it or not) is just another shining example of just how much this club means to all of us fans around the world. I love you all, I really do.

Con la presente intendiamo esprimere la nostra viva protesta per lo scandaloso arbitraggio di Dondarini ,che segue ad altrettanti precedenti arbitraggi ugualmente scandalosi.Da tifosi del calcio e della Juventus , nonchè da gente che paga e investe in questo mondo , ESIGIAMO rispetto .
Arbitraggi come quello di ieri sera , scatenano solo rabbia e violenza ,poichè la sensazione di un
arbitraggio in piena malafede è molto alta (come si possono negare 2 rigori eclatanti , pergiunta visti da posizione favorevolissima?). Errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum.
Prenderemo opportuni provvedimenti a tutela della nostra squadra , nel limite del possibile , qualora dovessero ripetersi simili scempi.Siamo pronti in massa, attraverso accordi interni alla tifoseria juventina, a boicottare tutto il sistema-calcio e tutti i giornali e le trasmissioni che trattano il calcio.
Cordiali Saluti
Tifosi Bianconeri
LETTERA DI PROTESTA DEI TIFOSI BIANCONERI #2
Spett.li FIGC e Lega calcio,
Con la presente noi tifosi juventini, dopo aver preso visione senza più dubbi di sorta che è in atto un tentativo di falsare il corso del campionato con decisioni arbitrali al limite dell’assurdo, decisioni che vedono continuamente danneggiata la Juventus e favorita un’altra ben nota società di calcio, CHIEDIAMO alla FIGC di fermare immediatamente il campionato e condurre una seria operazione di controllo sui propri effettivi, arbitrali e non.
Noi tifosi juventini siamo stanchi di subire vessazioni enormi come MAI ce ne sono state a danno di altre società di calcio nella storia di questo sport (e ribadiamo: MAI) . E per tutelare la nostra squadra del cuore siamo pronti, uniti e compatti , come poche volte nella nostra storia, ad adire alle vie legali contro la FIGC e i suoi dirigenti.
Laddove non ha potuto un processo-farsa come quello intentatoci contro a livello sportivo, noi tifosi juventini speriamo potrà finalmente mettere luce la Magistratura Ordinaria, organo di Giustizia capace, come altri organi non hanno voluto fare, di chiarire la natura dei rapporti economici ed interpersonali che intercorrono tra gli attuali vertici della federazione stessa e determinati altri personaggi in causa.
Noi tifosi juventini non ci faremo più abbindolare ed annebbiare la mente dalle dichiarazioni fumose di chicchessia, nè dai finti provvedimenti elargiti in risposta a scandali come quelli avvenuti durante l’incontro Reggina-Juventus del corrente anno.
Noi pensiamo che ci sia malafede e contro tale ipotesi intendiamo muoverci nel concreto delle istituzioni che contano davvero.
Aggiungiamo, in conclusione, che gli strumenti che la Costituzione italiana ci garantisce, con particolare riferimento al potere giudiziario ordinario, i quali non furono utilizzati da chi di dovere durante i noti fatti di Calciopoli, non saranno l’unica delle nostre rimostranze, perchè siamo pronti ad organizzare un boicottaggio totale che intendiamo estendere a tutti i gangli vitali del sistema calcistico italiano: che vada dalle TV a pagamento ai giornali sportivi.
Siamo circa 10 milioni di tifosi sparsi per tutta Italia, e non solo, e lavoreremo nel lungo periodo perchè quasi tutti questi 10 milioni di tifosi juventini cessino di portare soldi e interesse a questo vostro edificio pseudo-sportivo.
Esortandovi a non prenderci alla leggera, cogliamo la presente per ribadire le nostre ferme intenzioni. Non molleremo di un millimetro.
Grazie.

With the present communication, we wish to express our discontent regarding the scandalous officiating of Dondarini that follows many other proceeding incidents equally controversial this season. As Juventus and football fans, as well as paying customers of the sport itself, WE DEMAND respect. Officiating like that witnessed Saturday evening, only prompts anger and violence, and encourages further ill intended officiating by brushing aside clear penalties not awarded as human error while preserving the status quo.
We are demanding immediate action regarding the officiating of our squad to the full possible extent, should such incidents persist, we are ready to launch a mass boycott through agreements established throughout the organized Juventus fan base of all newspapers, magazines, TV/Satellite transmissions etc that sustain the world of football.
LETTER OF PROTEST #2
To the attention of the FIGC and Lega Calcio,
We Juventini, after witnessing the indisputable manner in which this championship is being falsified with officiating decisions that border on absurd, which continue to damage the progress of Juventus while favoring certain clubs, WE DEMAND that the FIGC put an immediate halt on the league in order to conduct an internal investigation of all directors, assistants and referees.
We the fans of Juventus are exhausted by the incomprehensible manner in which this championship has been falsified with the purpose of damaging one society in particular (something NO other season has ever witnessed). In order to see to it that our club receives the proper treatment we are ready, united and compact like never before, to take our fight with YOU the FIGC to the competent external legal parties that can ensure proper action.
Where your farce of a trial came short in ensuring a clean game, we the fans of Juventus are anxious once and for all to shed light on this situation with the Civil Magistrates, and other organisms of Justice that previously went ignored by some, in order to clarify the conflicts of interest that govern the game between certain personalities that fund our sport and their connection to our league and specifically certain societies.
We Juventini will not be satisfied with your senseless and incoherent explanations and excuses that further add confusion, nor will we tolerate your fake provisions for a better game that seldom see the light of day like the promises again made after the scandalous actions of Reggina-Juventus.
We are adamant that there is ill intent directed at our club and we intend to move forward in the direction of a concrete resolution in the institutions that can provide a real change.
We would like to add that the rights that our Constitution guarantees, with particular reference to the right to Civil Justice which were clearly violated during Calciopoli, will not be our only course of action due to our readiness to organize a mass and total boycott which will be extended to every single aspect of the football world in our nation which includes but is not limited to TV and newspapers that sponsor the game.
We are 10 million strong in Italy alone who have been loyal customers of your pseudo-sports world and know the extent of what a mass boycott could mean to you financially.
In closing we wish to express that if our demand is not met with proper attention, we will launch all that has been promised. We will not change our position by so much as a millimeter!
Grazie.

,"right, thanks adam. Check out www.alluc.org guys.
Michael i’m guessing your familiar with the idea of streaming so you’ll catch on to this quickly. The best site i’ve seen by far for football, and sports in general, is www.myp2p.eu
From there you can search by sport discipline/days of the week/competitions/divisions etc. (really thorough you get my point) through their tabs at the top of the screen under “Live Sports”.
Once you’ve found your particular game, find the small t.v. icon with an arrow in it- located just off to the right of it and click on it.
Then your selected match will have several links from different broadcasters selected underneath it. Directly to the right of each individual broadcaster are underlined software video viewers. “Sopcast” “PPmate” “TVU” “Media Player” “TVAnts” and “Other”
By clicking on one of them should automatically start up the program and Viola, your whoring with the best of em.
Of course you’ll obviously need to have the specified software pre-installed. No biggie (baby baby), follow this link to the downloads page:
http://77.247.179.69/software.php?part=software
Follow this link to the live sports page:
http://77.247.179.69/index.php?part=sports
The most popular one is Sopcast, i’d suggest you to download that program first since your almost always gonna have that option from a broadcaster on any given match day.
If i’m unclear on any of this, let me know. Good Luck Michael.",roberto ,"Feb 14, 2008 ", 1:13 PM,

I think it’s just cause they were all tired (without Subs and reserves, they all had to play) from today, Inter, Livorno, and Inter in less than two weeks. Belardi played great today! Made some good saves that kept us in the game which a normal backup would have been forgiven for missing.

Roma has been in better form than Inter or Juve and could win it… you know, assuming that they don’t get blasted sideways by one or more of those shitty refs the second that they inch to within a couple points of Inter. /mild conspiracy theory moment
But us pipping them both at the end? While it’s mathematically possible, we’d essentially have to win out our last 8 games and between crappy form and our own shitty refs, we haven’t managed to put together a string of more than 3 wins in a row all season long. As much as I’d love to see Juve win the scudetto straight out of serie b… 8 wins in a row – well 9 technically if you include the win against InterMerda last week – just doesn’t seem all that likely even if our remaining games are against teams that we really should be able to beat.

I think if juve focus and really actually belive in themselves and want to win the scudetto, they can. its 8 games that have to be won. thats it. its the final weeks and this is when it counts. we have to hope that the teams inter plays will step up nd help us out a little and if roma just kinda moves outta the way so we can just do what needs to be done. our chances are getting slimmer and slimmer with every scoring chance missed and every crappy ref that steps on the pitch but we cant give up, there is still a chance and just think how sweet it would be for us to upset EVERYONE!!!!",Sofia ,"Mar 31, 2008 ", 12:58 PM,

,"From Goal.com
""News on the incident is still sketchy at this stage, but it is understood that the Parma fan was accidentally run over by a coach, driven by Juventus fans, while he was on his way to this afternoon’s game at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin.
Full details are still emerging but the supporter, 27-year-old Matteo Bagnaresi, was at a motorway service station on the A1 between Alessandria and Asti.
Tension was said to be rising between groups of rival supporters, and some newspapers say that a bus containing nine Juve fans was attacked. The driver then tried to get away and accidentally ran over Bagnaresi.
The driver of the bus reportedly did not even know he had run over a person, and was stopped 2km down the highway by police, pleading that he did not know what had happened.
As a precaution Juventus and Parma decided to call off this afternoon’s game.
By a cruel twist of fate this tragedy takes place on the return matchday from when Lazio fan Gabriele Sandri was accidentally shot dead by policeman at a motorway service station on November 11.
This report will be updated throughout the day as more details emerge.""
RIP Matteo",roberto ,"Mar 30, 2008 ", 9:06 AM,
,"Game apparently rescheduled for April 16th.

“While the death of a Parma fan run over by Juventus supporters is clarified, there are reports the game could be rescheduled for April 16.
The Serie A game was called off this afternoon as a sign of mourning and amid fears of crowd trouble after 27-year-old Matteo Bagnaresi was killed at a motorway service station outside Turin.
The exact dynamics are still hazy, as there are two different versions of events. Some eyewitnesses claim the driver was looking in his mirrors to check the chasing Parma supporters were not closing in and therefore did not notice Bagnaresi crossing his path.
Another version given by a friend of the deceased insists it was a tragic accident and had nothing to do with football.
""Matteo was near to the rear tyres of the minibus and was hit when it went into reverse. The driver did not see or realise what had happened.
""We tried shouting at him to stop, but he was probably afraid and thought we were threatening him, so he drove off.""
According to witnesses at the motorway service station, there was no physical contact whatsoever between the two sets of fans.
All there was before the driver got into the minibus was an exchange of verbal insults.
The game was called off to avoid potential reprisals and passed without further incident at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin.
The date for the rescheduled tie will be decided tomorrow, but is likely to be Wednesday April 16.""

,"Despite being a complete piece of shit as an individual, Mancini as a tactician is a good coach… though the team is completely made up of heartless mercenaries (except for the foreigner Zanetti who does have class), they do play some nice football; Mancini loves to press quick attacks from the wings, and is not afraid to play with two, three, or even four strikers.
Unfortunately (or maybe not unfortunately for us who laugh at Inter) dressing room problems have always been center stage for the pathetic Interistas, as it takes more than world-class players to make a world-class team. Ask Ronaldo or Adriano or Baggio or Lippi… Historically Inter has always self-destructed from in-house bickering, as they love to hire arrogant prima-donnas and hang their dirty laundry for all to see. Mancini has not helped the team overcome these flaws; he resigns and then unresigns, Suazo fiasco, Adriano’s rehab (“no, no no!”), Matrix loves/hates/loves him, blah blah blah.
But is it Mancini’s fault that the club’s culture is a negative one? I suppose he hasn’t done much to lead by example.
Ranieri on the other hand is quite the character. Not a world-class coach (at least not yet) he’s still all class, and has a passionate way of leading his team; just remember his quote from Parma last season, “I will take no prisoners, leave nobody injured, you’re either with me or you die!” Plus he looks dashing with his fur-lined coat.
I think Ranieri has done a good job so far, despite those performances this season where we lost points that we really should have won. And though he might not be as celebrated as Mancini, I’m still glad he’s our Mister. I’d like to see him give more of a chance to home-grown young Italian talent, like he did with Rossi at Parma last season.
I wish we bought Rossi last season instead of Iaquinta… Vincenzo’s the man, but imagine if next season we fielded Rossi alongside Giovinco and Palladino? That’s the attack for the national team next World Cup.",MIkeDG ,"Mar 26, 2008 ", 11:49 AM,

After the usual warm-up with the ball, the Bianconeri carried out individual technique exercises, practising passing and one-against-two defensive play. Finally, the usual training match, played seven-a-side on a smaller pitch. Claudio Ranieri had a large squad at his disposal, but without the internationals, plus Marchionni, who stayed in the gym today, and Jonathan Zebina, who went back to the gym as well after the warm-up.

Juventus are back at full ranks. Indeed Claudio Ranieri this afternoon welcomed back the internationals who had been busy with their national teams in the last few days: Sissoko, who in any case didn’t play for Mali against the French B team, alongside Trezeguet, Buffon, Camoranesi and Iaquinta, who all carried out light training. Grygera had already returned to base yesterday and trained separately, like Jonathan Zebina. Marchionni stayed in the gym, while the rest of the team, after ball possession exercises on a smaller pitch, were divided in two groups and worked alternatively on attacking set-ups and on individual technique, before the usual training match.

,"Not sure about your “Juve playing one of their best football this year” claim roberto, because even though we clearly dominated the Napoli match, I can recall several other games this season during which we had considerably better free-flowing footy.
As for your ‘holy trinity’ of success (the ‘keys to your heart’ as you’ve dubbed them), well… it’s all true stuff, but to say that‘s what made Juve better against Napoli is a bit of an over-simplification in my opinion. Talking about Serie A isn’t exactly like talking about your Sunday night league, there are plenty of other factors taking effect concurrently in a professional team. I will admit however, that when all else fails it’s sometimes best to go back to basics, but I hope it’ll be a while before Juve have to resort to that.
Regarding your Trezeguet-Camoranesi correlation, I’ve never quite thought of it that way but it does make for a very interesting observation. The value Camoranesi brings to the team is undeniable, but claiming that when he’s absent, the service to Trezeguet considerably drops is certainly true (Juve then have to rely on other providers for the tall Frenchman, e.g. ADP, Zanetti, Nedved).
As for this week-end, I sincerely hope we get to win it, not only for our own sake but also to make the Scudetto race final rush a little bit more interesting. Above all, I’d hate Inter to win it again this year…",Marco P. ,"Mar 20, 2008 ", 8:08 PM,
,"I agree with almost all what you said. Camoranesi really does provide that extra in our squad, I love Pavel and he’s still playing excellently, but our squad copes better without him than Camo. I’ve always said he was the most underrated midfielder in Italy, and certainly the world.
How about that 3-4-1-2 employed against Napoli from the start! We all have been surprised that the Tinkerman hasn’t been tinkering as much, but goddamn, that was a game when we DID NOT EVER USE 4-4-2! How weird is that. Definitely not something to do against Inter, we need to be conservative, but I’m glad to see him mix it up.
Empoli we played too tentative, and clearly were anticipating the game this weekend. It’s not Ranieri’s fault, it’s Secco. The game clearly showed we simply don’t have enough people in our squad…not enough good subs. Our midfield had no one to replace Camo, and I was a bit surprised he played ADP for the full 90’, a bit worried too. Hopefully he’ll be rested and raring to go for this weekend.",Alessio ,"Mar 21, 2008 ", 2:15 AM,

“People say they bought the Premiership title, but a few years ago in Italy Internazionale were every year spending double, treble, what other teams spent. They couldn’t win anything.

,i agree with you roberto. some players go for the over the top passes and all that does is give our opponents the ball. nocerino does this alot and usually fails. he did however pull off an amazing move during the empoli game when he chipped the ball over an opponent in midfield but followed with a horrible pass.,adam ,"Mar 21, 2008 ", 5:10 AM,

,"Marco Marco Marco, having watched all of the matches Juventus have played this season thus far (many more than once), there’s no question in my mind that our performance against Napoli for once, incorporated patience in our style of play; which isn’t a direct link to free-flowing footy.
Free-flowing footy involves many more strategic/technical fundamentals that, like you alluded too, are part of “other factors taking effect concurrently in a professional team”. However, remember this Marco, no one should ever be accused of over-simplifying the game of soccer; Sunday night beer league or professional matchday competitions.

We can’t forget about Cruz either though. Legrottaglie needs to keep him close. Remember Cruz’s two goals in our first leg Coppa Italia match? He took a ball off his chest that split our D, then slotted it by Belardi like he was on the practice pitch. Legrottaglie is gonna need some help from Zebina on this one.

Eh Alessio, Secco was in Germany a few days ago. The poor guy probably still thinks he has a shot at landing Diego, boy that’s never gonna happen. Diego is going to Real Madrid 100%. Robinho and him are like life-partners, and Juventus will ultimately be out-bidded in the end either way. Oh well, Secco probably knows that and is just trying to rack up some Air Miles before he gets the axe!

Juventus travel to the San Siro to take on archrivals FCIM, or Football Club Inter Merda in the biannual Derby d’Italia. Juventus and Inter have an exact same last 5-record, WDWLD. Neither team are in a good spell at the moment, but both teams are eager to give themselves a cushion above Roma and Fiorentina, respectively. Thus far, Juve have drawn Inter twice (1-1 in Serie A at home, 2-2 in Coppa Italia away) and lost once (3-2 in Coppa at home) against Inter, so logically it’s time they lose at home! Inter are without the suspended Pele, and Juve continue to miss Zanetti. The real champions vs. the false champions. South America v. Europe. Chiellini v. Ibrahimobitch. Buffon v. Cesar. Del Piero v.

Excerpt:
Someone played a bad joke on Inter Saturday night, and Roberto Mancini wasn’t laughing. And who can blame him? Juventus waited until the return leg of the Derby d’Italia to come back to greatness: true greatness, the kind that makes you feel part of European football’s Elite.
The Evidence? The players. From Gianluigi Buffon (proving once again why he’s considered to be the best goalkeeper on Earth) through to Giorgio Chiellini (who is slowly achieving superstar status as a center-back) and Mauro Camoranesi (Juve just can’t do without him), all the way to David Trezeguet (another vital goal to maintain the lead of the Serie A scoring charts), every man on Claudio Ranieri’s team was almost perfect. The only one coming a little bit short: Alessandro Del Piero, failing to finish two key 3-0 chances that’d have put the game on ice for the Bianconeri, but the author of an otherwise A+ performance.
On Saturday night, in a 58,000 spectactor-laden Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, the Bianconeri achieved what no other Serie A team has managed to do this season: beat Inter Milan at home, in the temple of Italian football.",Marco P. ,"Mar 23, 2008 ", 3:50 PM,

I think your formation is wishful thinking. Ranieri loves Molinaro, not so much Palladino. And Del Piero’s been in good form, even with a slight dip. Since we don’t have Camoranesi, we have to play him over Iaquinta to start..otherwise T-Rez (as you call him, I like it) is going to be stranded up front. (I would like to see Iaquinta get more playing time) I foresee this-
Grygera Chiellini Stendardo Molinaro

,"I would be down for a 4-3-3. Iaquinta needs to play more, and since that 4th spot in midfield is up for grabs…..why not eliminate it?",Alessio ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 11:27 AM,
,"Welcome back roberto.
Let’s not get too excited vis-à-vis Grygera just yet, shall we? He scored a great goal, played an amazing game last week, but that was one match out of the dozens or so mediocre performances coming before that. Me, I like continuity… I need 2-3 games at least before a player joins the “approved” list. And I don’t understand why you keep dissing Molinaro. Sure his crossing ability needs some improvement, but the lad’s been running his ass off in every single match he started for Juve this year. At the cost of being branded with heresy, I’ll even say he reminds me of Zambrotta minus the crossing part. A dynamo.
Regarding Tiago, I read the “Praise the Portuguese, give him time” Ranieri interview too. Honestly, I get the feeling Ranieri’s the kind of man who’ll give everyone the benefit of the doubt, he’s way too kind. He says Tiago’s been playing better and more motivated in training? I can only take his word for it. So far, Tiago’s match performance can be very easily defined: lackluster, no personality, shadow-of-former-self. Where the hell is the Tiago who made Lyon win games? I’m tired of waiting for Godot.
With that said, I guess that with Sissoko in from minute 1 the creative part of midfield will have to be left to the Portuguese (no offense Nocerino, but you’re a lot more effective at killing play than creating it). Then again, Nocerino might have an added motivation factor on his side, given he himself is a Napoli native.
Regarding Sissoko, ditto on what you said. Myself, I liked him from day 1 to be honest, ever since I did his career profile on mCalcio. There’s a lot of untapped potential in that kid, and over time I think he can significantly improve his passing distribution as well.
As for our striking starters today, it’d be very surprising for me to see ADP benched: our captain has been a regular executioner of Napoli in the past years, and I want him on the field to put those “Zona” goals in. Then again, following the traditional squad rotation policy I’d say his time has come. Were I Ranieri though, I’d wait an extra game on this one.",Marco P. ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 11:45 AM,
,"Marco, you must not be watching the same games as us. Molinaro’s crossing is crap, and his defending is hot-or-cold. He plays like Napoli does. And Grygera has been mediocre because in almost every game, he’s been played out of position. Center-back, left-back, but not right-back.
I’m hoping Tiago gets to play. I’m waiting for him to show up but he was such a good midfielder for Portugal+Lyon, let’s hope he gets out of his funk.",Alessio ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 11:48 AM,
,"Thanks Marco, it’s good to be back in Burbank.
You’re right on the money about everything, even those heresy charges buddy. I shouldn’t get excited about Grygera I know, he’s second string (two years ago) but i’m more excited that we can replace Molinaro.
Molinaro’s runs may be a little reminiscent of Zambrotta’s long strides and similar slowish speed but I would never relate their qualities with respect to Zambrotta’s choice of passes, off-the-ball runs, or most importantly his defending. Like I’ve said in the past, Molinaro has reached his potential and it will simply not make the grade for Juventus… this season and especially not the next… not ever really.
As for the 4-3-3 formation I would love to see more that. I think Ranieri is too caught up with wing play so he resorts to a lot 4-4-2 type shit. If we had some solid defenders we could certainly get away some 2-4-1-3 with the attacking mids we have as well as the possessing mids and defending mids as well. Then we can use Iaquinta full time have ADP slotted behind them, and run some wing play whilst still using our defensive mids …. aaahummm Tiago.",roberto ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 12:12 PM,

,"Napoli was absolutely terrible (save Santacroce) and the fact that it took 85 minutes to get a goal was ridiculous. Our left flank (aka Molinaro) could not cross properly to save their lives.

Napoli was missing some key players and you guys were playing in front of your home folks with supposed revenge on your minds. The Iaquinta goal was a fluke and only happened because Domizzi misplayed it.
Oh by the way, if there was ever any doubt, Tiago has proven that he was a huge waste of money….
FORZA NAPOLI!!!! I’ll se you guys next year in San Paolo…I guarantee a Juventini beating at the hands of Napoli!!!",Fortunato ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 6:52 PM,
,"Alessio, we’ll have to agree on disagreeing about Molinaro. I already acknowledged his crossing his sub-par, but the defending? I’m sorry but… which games did you watch? Guy is running up and down the wing endlessly, supporting the attack and coming back to defend equally. For a guy that’s only 24 years old, he’s still got potential for improvement roberto.
And that comment about Grygera being played out of position? Grygera is, by definition, a versatile player: he can play left-back, center-back, and right-back equally well. That’s one of the main reasons Juve bought him. The fact that, so far, he hasn’t played well has got nothing to do with where Ranieri has placed him. Grygera used to cover the right-back side at Ajax, and now after the Genoa-Juve game everybody’s singing his praises now, for a game during which he played left-back. So positioning really ain’t the problem here.
Fortunato, you want objectivity? How’s this:
1) Napoli was missing some key players? Who? Zalayeta and Blasi? How about the fact nearly half of the Juve starters were out of action today (Legrottaglie, Camoranesi, Zebina suspended, Cristiano Zanetti injured). Talk about forced substitutions, huh?
2) What chances Juve had? Ditto what Alessio said. Honestly, did Buffon have to make any serious save today? I don’t think so. The entirety of the match was played in the Napoli half, with Juve getting close to hitting the target many times over (two Tiago shots come to mind, one from outside the box deflected by Gianello, another inches over the crossbar, Stendardo and Iaquinta headers, long-range attempts by Nedved).
So please, you can be a sore loser and moan about the 90th minute loss, but try to use facts to back up what you say.",Marco P. ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 7:51 PM,
,"Well, to be fair to Grygera, we didn’t buy him. We got him for free. I meant he’s primarily a fullback, and most of the campaign he’s been played as center-back. Like Tiago, he’s done well recently with the little time he had.
Molinaro does work his ass off, but there have been several instances where he’s just been plain beaten. (Lazio comes to mind) I know at another Juventino forum I’m on he’s probably the most disliked player in the squad. He’s not a disaster by any means, he’s just incredibly mediocre, and he’s 24, almost 25. Nocerino, who I’ve criticized, I think has enormous potential, and he’s 2-3 years younger.
Speaking of young players, how about Momo today. I was a huge critic but he is getting better and better every game, and today, jesus, he was tackling all the way over the fucking field.",Alessio ,"Mar 16, 2008 ", 11:22 PM,
,WE WON! Forza grande Iaquinta.,Chxta ,"Mar 17, 2008 ", 12:04 AM,
,"Agreed on Sissoko. That guy’s quality, I sincerely hope Liverpool will deeply regret letting him go. However, defensive contribution: A+, offensive contribution: B. You gotta stop losing those balls inside our own half Momo.
I was quite satisfied with Tiago’s contribution as well for once. Nothing extraordinary, but boy… that 25-yarder was headed straight inside the post had Gianello not been there.
Oh and as usual, until roberto goes to work on the game report (how kind am I roberto, helping you out and all ;P ) you can read mine here, if you’re interested.",Marco P. ,"Mar 17, 2008 ", 12:09 PM,
,"Marco. You want objectivity and facts? You got it:
-Juve had 6 corners to 4 for Napoli;
-Juve had 4 shots on the net compared to 2 for Napoli;
-Juve had 14 shots off of the net compared to 5 for Napoli (some were good chances, some were long range that were going no where shots);
-Juve had the territorial advantage of 58% to 42% (not anything like 75/25 as you describe it “the whole game was played in Napoli’s end”);
-Forget Zalayeta (you can have him back as far as I care) the loss of Blasi (on loan from you guys)is huge to our midfield. We do’t have the depth you guys do so please let’s not try to compare plus not having Camoranesi is probably a blessing. He’s tempramental and overrated!
Napoli played a very good road game and in my mind, a 0-0 draw would have been very well deserved.",Fortunato ,"Mar 17, 2008 ", 12:51 PM,
,"Erm… wow… you do realize all the figures you’ve just given me completely prove my point, don’t you?
By the way, when I said “the whole game was played in Napoli’s end”, I meant exactly that. Your 58/48% stat means nothing, because which team had ball possession inside that half is completely irrelevant: Napoli were simply having a tough time getting out of their defensive zone, with our without the ball.
I’m not even going to comment what you said about Camoranesi and Zalayeta. You do know El Panterón is your team’s leading topscorer (8 goals, 2 more than Hamsik and 3 more than Lavezzi), right?",Marco P. ,"Mar 17, 2008 ", 2:13 PM,
,"OK. So you’re saying that my stats are proving your point but then again the 58/42 territorial stat means nothing. Juve had the advantage in stats BUT they were the heavily favoured home team and they were supposed to crush Napoli and they didn’t. Napoli played a good road game and could’ve easily have tied had it not been for a defensive gaff by Domizzi. Napoli had their share of chances as well (check the hi-lights again). Juve did not completely dominate the game and the win was not inevitable. My friend, the stats do not prove total domination at all. Your own Juventini friends will attest to that!!! Objectivity backed up by facts my dear Alessio, not outrageous fanaticism.
Also, ask any Napoli supporter about El Panteron’s goals. They were bunched over three or four games and only one or two really involved true skill. Most of them were of the garbage variety. Most Napoli fans are embracing Calaio getting a starting role at the striker position with Zalayeta out.
It’s not all about goals either, if not you would be proving my point that Camoranesi, being paid 3 mill, has only three goals (cost of 1 mill per goal) and our 20 year old midfielder Hamsik has six goals, at a salary of 0.5 mill, has six goals (83,000 per goal). Using your logic then, I rest my case. Camoranesi is overrated and overpaid!!!",Fortunato ,"Mar 17, 2008 ", 6:21 PM,
,"Fortunato, good thing the only stat that matters is 1-0.",R.J. ,"Mar 17, 2008 ", 8:05 PM,
,I rest my case too. To equate Camoranesi’s contribution to the team solely on the amount of the goals that he scores is purely and simply complete ignorance. Pointless to continue this debate with you.,Marco P. ,"Mar 18, 2008 ", 12:00 AM,
,"fortunato, hamsik has scored 6 goals in 27 matches, camoranesi has scored 3 in 13, hamsik has played more than twice as much yet they have almost the same goals to games ratio. if camoranesi wasnt injured as much as he is he could have gotten more than hamsik. but we’ll never know for sure. and saying that he is overrated is crazy talk. if youve been following juve this season, which u probably havent, ull see the difference he makes in the team, napoli was lucky he didnt play because if he did u guys would of been raped. and if anyone’s overrated it napoli’s extremely inconsistent Lavezzi, 5 goals in 24 matches. maybe in a few years he could be worthy of being put in the same sentence as camoranesi. but till then hes nothing more than promising kid. the only true talent you have on your team is hamsik and id be more than happy if we buy him from you guys, maybe then he can score 12 goals in 27 matches.",adam ,"Mar 18, 2008 ", 1:39 AM,

,"Wow, it’s rare to find another Juventino who isn’t screaming “SACK RANIERI.” I agree. Given the refereeing mistakes, we’re having a pretty damn good season. The recent games have been bothersome, I don’t know what’s up.
You didn’t mention one of the chief criticisms of Ranieri is even with great teams he’s never won any real silverware. I believe he can. Lippi is probably not coming back, and people need to get over it.
I don’t think anyone can disagree with firing Secco. He’s been a disaster, and we cannot afford to have another transfer market with him at the helm. People blame Ranieri for a lot of the transfer decisions, in reality, he’s not responsible for them almost at all. Secco was stupid for selling Balzaretti and bringing in Molinaro, attempting to sell our beast Chiellini, etc. He needs to leave immediately.",Alessio ,"Mar 3, 2008 ", 8:59 PM,
,"i really doubt seeing any BIG stars joining juve this summer. ranieri gets marchisio and giovinco back next season so he will give them a chance. as for strikers he already has ADP, Trez, and Iaquinta. palladino is an attacking mid which he is better at than as a striker. De ceglie might come back as a striker. defence will be the only place where we get reinforcements, criscito will come back and were gonna get a side back along with melberg. Ranieri puts way too much faith in his young players which is like a gamble it can payoff or it can ruin you (palladino payed off, molinaro did not).
probable formation next year:
BUFFON

,"the thing with this new management people dont understand is that theyre building a team for the future not the present. when buffon trez and camoranesi renewed the said this team is a project that would take 3-5 years to get back to the team they were. only thing is that the management could of done it in a year with the money they had at their disposal and thats why everyone is pissed including me. ranieri is not that bad of a coach look at what he did with parma last year. i think he took camo off against roma and viola because hes been injured three times this season and he doesnt want to risk losing him for the rest of the season. he does have bad descisions at times but all coaches do, good and bad. secco is the real problem, about 30m (not including sissoko) was a waste of money. for 30m he could of signed milito who was 3-4m away from a deal with zaragoza and juve, VDV for no more than 25m. and i really think they should of gotten roberto carlos who was out of contract. with these three realistic targets juve could of been targeting at the minimum second place this year. if secco does stay look forward to seeing mediocre players being bought at a world class price.",adam ,"Mar 4, 2008 ", 1:59 AM,

,"I agree with adam totally. With the 30 million euro we frankly wasted on boumsong, tiago, and almiron, Secco should have had the balls to go for one or two world class defense or midfield stars. Juventus has this fucking horrible tendency of trying TOO hard to get the cheapest price for a player like milito or ivanovic from lokomotiv (i’m still bitter about that missing out on that serb). In today’s game, owners are more concerned now then at any other time in the past with building their team’s brand name for mass appeal. As a result, the teams that follow that logic (like chelsea, liverpool, man utd., real madrid etc.) are consistently shelling out the cash for players 3 to 4 million above the market price and in so, willl continue to leave other teams, like US, holding our dick in our hands.
I’m all for building a solid team without breaking the bank, but this is just ridiculous money management on secco & co.‘s part by not realising the economic climate within the game today. Moggi would have known that when you’ve locked your sights on a player that fits within your team strategy and mentality, 3 to 4 million above your original offer of 10-12 million euro or 20-25 million for example, are peanuts. In the big scheme of things Secco is trying too hard to diversify his board’s capital and what’s worse is that he’s choosing flop after flop to invest in.
It seems like this summer Secco will still be in charge of the signings. Let’s hope Ranieri can talk some sense into him about at least one MAJOR WORLD CLASS DEFENDER PURCHASE!
SPEND SOME FUCKING MONEY BITCH :) PLEASE!",roberto ,"Mar 4, 2008 ", 4:15 PM,

However, if we cannot attain flamini or anymore depth in our midfield a Napoli trade straight up for hamsik would be interesting?? doubtful but interesting.

I don’t think Barzagli is the right guy, that Spain match changed my mind about him, i don’t think he is the Champion defender we are looking for. Juve need someone like Zambro or Canna back there who is going to be a wall. I definately like your idea adam of getting an old guy until our youth players are ready, we just have to ensure that whoever said old man is that he is reliable. Wasting money on Amauri is almost as stupid as buying Tiago. The only thing that Secco did that made sense this season is selling Boumsong and buying Sissoko. Buying Amauri is not worth giving up our youth players. They are the future and since we talk about how we want to have the team of the future we shouldn’t be selling our future, especially not to our direct competition. I honestly don’t see what Secco sees in Tiago, sorry Sally I have to disagree, Tiago doesn’t need anymore playing time. Ranieri has given him chances and he is still behind the likes of Nocerino in the midfield pecking order, and seeing as you all hate him, apparently thats not saying much. Personally, I see potential in Nocerino but I can say it time and time again but no one agrees so I have given up on that one. If Secco was smart he would buy DEFENCE not FORWARDS.

2. The Maldini “foul” that set up the free kick that led to the winner. Sure didn’t look like a foul to me.

Couldnt agree with you more on the cafu reference. Maybe its the way he chews his gum or the subtle grins he gives as he trots up and down the flanks. I just think he’s over the whole process of giving a shit. He rarely plays as it is.
Considering that bonera tackled from behind in such a reckless mannor and because their was no way for him to win the ball, seeing as momo was a good yard ahead of him, i think it was deserving.

,"Juventus in Amauri Switch: original source Corriere dello Sport, via C4
Palermo and Juventus have agreed a provisional deal for the transfer of Amauri, according to the Corriere dello Sport. The talented Brazilian marksman is hot property in the peninsula and is widely known to be Juve’s principal transfer target this summer. Recent reports have suggested that Amauri has his heart set on joining the Old Lady, but that Spanish champions Real Madrid could hijack the deal. However, the Corriere dello Sport insists that Juve sporting director Alessio Secco has reached an agreement with Palermo’s transfer chief Rino Foschi. The fee is believed to be around £8.4m plus the rights to Azzurrini midfielder Antonio Nocerino and former Parma winger Marco Marchionni. There are also whispers that Secco is considering offering defender Domenico Criscito – currently on loan at Genoa – to try and reduce the cash payment. A month ago, there were claims that Secco had proposed a part exchange of £12m plus Sebastian Giovinco, Paolo De Ceglie and Claudio Marchisio.But with Giovinco excelling at Empoli and De Ceglie impressing in a Siena shirt, such an offer seems reckless and highly unlikely. It has been suggested that Coach Claudio Ranieri vetoed the original proposal, but that he is happier with the new terms.",roberto ,"Apr 10, 2008 ", 1:38 PM,

,haha YOU havent paid anything. Berlusconi did,Dario ,"Apr 10, 2008 ", 9:01 PM,
,"Going back to our topic of Palmero’s amore Amauri, from a boardroom or coaching perspective, the Brazilian Italian would no doubt add to our attacking presence, but more importantly, he’d be a great addition for our Champions League push next season. We all know about the tribulations of fighting on several fronts around Europe that can reap havoc on your squad. Also to be brutally honest (and R.J. will agree with me on this), Del Piero can’t realistically play for 90 mins each game next year. I love the guy, but his role should undoubtedly be limited as a super-sub. There’s no shame in coming off the bench. Iaquinta is the perfect example. He knows he isn’t gifted with Maradona’s technique, so intelligently he focuses on his true attributes as a ball breaking force of determination. Does he deserve a starting role next season for his patience this year? You could argue yes and no. However, we’ve seem to have seen him at his best this year coming off of the bench- and perhaps he knows that.
Naturally, Amauri would disrupt our current rotation. In terms of a formation, Ranieri would have to do what he’s ultimately paid to do. That means experimenting with more systems other than the classic 4-4-2 or 4-3-3, which isn’t a bad thing whatsoever. Another question to ask ourselves is: Who do we build this team around? To me, no one presently on the team can be given that tag- which isn’t a bad thing in football either. Giovinco makes a strong argument for himself, but utlimately he’ll have to come off now and then and we’ll need others in his place. Ranieri will have to pull out something from his bag of tricks, but it can be done i’m sure.
p.s. I’d give up Palladino and Nocerino straight up for Amauri. I have my reasons.",roberto ,"Apr 11, 2008 ", 9:45 AM,
,"Roberto, no offense, but are you kidding? Everyone said Del Piero couldn’t play 90minutes this season, and well he has certainly shut their mouths. Let’s also not forget he played 90min against Empoli, then 3 days later played 90minutes against Inter. And what happened? Oh yeah, people praised him against Inter as being one of the best performances they’d seen.
The whole “Del Piero too old, can’t play a full 90m” has been said in Italy for years, and it is clearly not true.
Moreso, supersub? Amauri I see as like Iaquinta, a pseudo-Trez replacement with limited skills. We have seen this season what happens when Iaquinta and Trez are up front together…it doesn’t work. Sure, some of it is inadequate service from midfield but when there’s no one up front with the tricks and speed of Del Piero, it doesn’t work.
Now obviously no player, including Del Piero, can play 90min 2x a week for 3-4 weeks in a row, which we will be doing next season. That’s why we have Iaquinta though. If one of them gets injured, we have Palladino and Giovinco.",Alessio ,"Apr 11, 2008 ", 11:09 AM,

RJ, two things- Alex has never been reknowned for his speed. He creates goals through his talent.

1) No to the “Del Piero = super-sub” idea. Ale won’t accept being benched, but if Ranieri keeps doing what he’s doing this year (i.e. start him 2/3 matches), fine by me. Stamina-wise Del Piero’s been impressive this season, but he can’t start every game and play for 90 minutes week in week out, that’s for damn sure. Next year it’s only gonna get worse.
2) Amauri >>>>>> Nocerino. With that said, I like Nocerino too, I hope we keep ‘im (even though he definitely lost his spot to Sissoko). But if we can get our hands on Amauri, we should jump at the opportunity, if only to prevent him going to Inter or Milan, and then bite our nails over it.
3) If Giovinco doesn’t feature prominently in Juve’s starting line-up next year, I’ll personally come to Torino to slap Secco and Ranieri in the face. With a big fu**ing spiked club.",Marco P. ,"Apr 11, 2008 ", 8:05 PM,

,"Joe, well, Ranieri obviously prefers a midfield with two defensive central midfielders, and pre-Sissoko that’s the only two we had, plus Tiago/Almiron, who were not given enough playing time, sucked. I don’t blame Ranieri for not playing them more…in that form you’d get attacked all over for it.
Nocerino has enormous potential…but Gattuso also sucked when he was young. I hope we keep onto him, loan him out next year (he’s young) because Cristiano Zanetti who is awesome, is not getting younger. Momo Sissoko is a beast though. So I’d say Nocerino was played because there weren’t any other real alternatives until Sissoko came around. (and then Zanetti got injured)",alessio ,"Apr 8, 2008 ", 10:31 AM,
,"thats true alessio but you cant deny that tiago hasent been improving alot. look at the parma game the first half we played horrible. when tiago came in for nocerino the midfield was alot better, passes were more complete and crosses were more accurate. nocerino was repeatedly giving the ball away and at this point of the season if we want to keep our champions league spot we cant afford to have someone like nocerino continuosly giving away the ball in midfield.",adam ,"Apr 8, 2008 ", 2:24 PM,
,"Nocerino has absolutely zero touch. the only thing he CAN do is play hard, but that doesn’t always translate to playing well. He goes all out for sure, but his touch is laughable at best. He can’t pass to save his life whether it be short, long, crossing, or through. His intensity is good but he needs to watch Zanetti, and how he calmly puts balls where they need to be, and learn.

,"in all honesty, what does being in C2 have to do with anything? on the one hand, you sit here and claim that you’re so die-hard because you stuck with your team through the “purgatory” that was ONE year in Serie B. That’s not being a die-hard…
Being a die-hard is supporting a team that isn’t a perennial powerhouse and doesn’t have endless coffers with which to spend on whomever they want. What I’ve been able to witness is a team reach A after REAL years of purgatory in the lower levels of calcio. A team that has been built around younger players who break through and buying those who others thought were cast-offs or has-beens. Most of you are probably supporters of Juventus because they’re good or have been good or you’ve recognized favorite players and therefore have supported the team. Yet, it’s easy for you to laugh off these other clubs because they don’t share the same “history”.
You guys have some dark spots on your “history” – proven or not, it’s still a big caca stain on your clean whitey tighties…and you got off pretty easy as did other “top” clubs like Milan. so yeah, i can sit here and smile when my “crappy” team takes down some “giants” in Juventus. I can laugh when the world’s #1 keeper is left standing hopeless as three BEAUTIFUL goals find the back of the net…and i can rejoice when the final whistle blows and my team comes out with 3 points.

We’re aware of the thrill that beating Juve comes. That’s why every single team comes at us like a derby. (No one else has that kind of deal) You should have seen Serie B last year when players knew that their 15 seconds would come from playing us…startling to see the difference in level of intensity between say Albinoleffe-Juve and Albinoleffe-Bari.

If Del Piero went down, Palladino would be our only supporting striker. Amauri gives us insurance, and with the CL we need that.
Sofia, everyone needs to stop saying “defense should be our #1 priority.” Juve management may be incompetent but they aren’t total idiots.

,"It was and is a terrible tragedy. All I can say is that at least the European football leagues were just as horrified as the fans. At least now stadia all over Europe have been rebuilt and local and regional law enforcement take fan violence and threatening behavior seriously.
I think the tragedy also changed the behavior of many fans. I am reading a book right now by an obsessive Arsenal fan – not a hooligan, just a guy who goes to all the games – called Fever Pitch. He has a chapter in the book about his reaction to the tragedy. Apparently, as a life-long fan who always stood in the terraces, he had participated in “running.” He describes it as when a group of supports from one team charge the area where the fans from the other team are sitting. It is not violent per se, but definitely threatening. He describes it as a goof and something all English fans would have been familiar with. Unfortunately, the Italian fans were not. They panicked, and, well, the rest is a horrible tragedy that never, ever should have happened. After Heysel, he stopped all of that: no running, no taunting of the other fans, no bullying of any kind.
Of course, he also writes about the shame he felt after watching the game. I still dont understand why they didnt cancel it.

,"Sofia, I got to agree with you that we need two or more defensive minded players. But we could use another force up front, and rightfully so, our management aren’t willing to bet that Palladino will turn into a dominate force in Serie A next season.

i’m happy with the fact that we’re getting Nocerino – we’ll be able to kick GUANA to the curb and get a young, determined replacement. Lanzafame is pissing me off though. If he wants to join the league of hacks, fine. He’ll regret that after he rides the bench due to injuries. His dad should talk some sense into him.

I don’t really see that from Amauri.",alessio ,"May 27, 2008 ", 9:22 PM,

besides, Palladino and Giovinco aren’t the same type of attacker that Amauri is. Both those guys are more Del Piero-esque (yeah, maybe not a word but w/e lol). Amauri is more like Trezegol, but with more strength and control.
as for Lanzafame, let’s face it, only a select few Italians have ever made a name for themselves in the EPL, and i don’t see him being one of them. I think he has a better chance of returning to Juve if he plays with Palermo than West Ham.
