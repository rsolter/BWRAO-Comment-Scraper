Fabio may be 1.75m but his vertical pounce gives him AT LEAST an additional extra meter. Something truly amazing to watch, best epitomized during the 2006 World Cup.
Also, Canna built his career on good positioning as you mentioned, but also very strong anticipation skills, being able to foresee where the ball is going to be played and making sure to be there before the striker.",Marco P. ,"Jun 11, 2010 ", 10:44 PM,

Not over-ecstatic about the Joe Cole rumors. He usually plays on the left which would mean that Giovinco’s chances of staying would decrease. I rather we use Giovinco and Salihamidzic as left midfielders. That would guarantee Gio a starting place and Sal can step in against the small teams.
After the Krasic move is complete I would live the club to finalize deals for a forward (Pazzini/Dzeko/Suarez) and the defense (Maggio/Motta, Bonucci/Kjaer, Gallas,left back). Starting to realize that Criscito isn’t good enough defensively to play for Juventus in a 4-4-2. He manages as a wing-back fine because de doesn’t have to defend as much but not in a 4-4-2, which is clear after watching the Italian national team. Can’t come up with any good names.

- Joe Cole plays on both sides but is, if I’m not mistaken, a left sided midfielder originally.
-I don’t think he would join without really good wages (which we can’t afford) and he will demand a starting role.
-Also if Joe Cole would arrive, it would send a message to Giovico that he might as well leave if he want’s more playing time.
-I do agree that Salihamidzic isn’t the best back-up but at least that would send message to Gio that he’s first-choice for the left side and we could save a lot of money not getting someone else.
-Pepe and Krasic would share the left sided midfield role. Both of them have played on the left for the majority of their careers.

I don’t think it’s even worth mentioned, but here’s if you’re interested. “wkwkwkwkwkwkwk” is an Indonesian popular term of saying hard laugh/laugh to death, etc. An extreme version of “hahahahaha”, if you like. To be honest it’s really weird even in popular Indonesian languange, let alone the proper one. IMHO, saying from my experience, most mature Indonesian people who uses it on a regular basis is rather has a childish personality or simply dumb. Needless to say that you would never see this stupid term in anykind of published materials (books, etc.), even if it’s a popular publication. Well, unless the writer is part of the (idiot) club too. They uses it primarly on the social-networking internet sites, text messaging, etc. In English the most equivalent term probably is “lol” (although the socio-anthropological explanation of it can be different).
So I would say that the dude that come up with that here (that Interista sammy dude with the Australian flag if I remember correctly) is really dumb. I mean being childish is one thing but to use this “childish-local” term in a globally English-speaking context like this blog is a completely different matter. But then again.. the term “dumb” is an understatement for most, if not all, interisti.",M29 ,"Jun 11, 2010 ", 7:59 AM,

He is widely regarded as a very gifted player, but I will reserve my judgement until I have seen him in action. At the moment I’m not impressed with most of the players we have been linked too. Bonucci is a gifted player, but its blindingly clear that Kjaer is the better player and has more potential. Not to mention that he appears to be the cheaper option at centre back.

Yeah maybe he lost all the big games, maybe 50% of those victories were flukes, but you cant argue with numbers over a season in serie A. For me, Leo’s man management and resource management are miles ahead of either Ferrara or Zac.
Anyways, back to Juventus. Although it breaks my heart, but the only two players who can say this are either Trez or Camo. Both of them had been used sparingly by Zac and are potentially transfer listed.

I agree with him that he started to turn things around, but one week against Siena and Fulham completely wrecked team morale, unrecoverably so.
Daniel, I thought Diego would stay. Then reading Marotta’s statements….and Zaccheroni revealing the Diego-Porto-DelNeri past, I don’t have much hope. Shame, the kid gave his best, played well, and doesn’t deserve to be booted out.
Which brings me to another thought, Del Neri’s past with current Juventini. He coached Amauri and Legrottaglie at Chievo, decent history with Amauri but he launched Legro to Italian fame, got him the transfer to Juve. Legro will stay because Del Neri probably gets along well with him (Legro seems pretty non-confrontational) Amauri might still be on the way out, don’t think Andrea Agnelli or Marotta like him much.

Simone Pepe is practically a Juve player. Football Italia has covered the story too. I’m very pessimistic about this summer, especially given Marotta’s idea that “we shouldn’t judge players from last season,; they are of the highest caliber”. Bullshit.

This is a rebuilding year, last year the old guard showed their age with injuries and all and our signings: Diego, Melo, Grosso and Cannavaro didn’t really light the field on fire. Some of those players are worth keeping but others certainly need to go while the old guard has to start retiring or being used less.
As it stands we are going to get three new players in defense, at least 2 new starters in midfield and one new forward. It will take them time to gel and I really doubt this team will be impressing until January. Realistically I see a team like this:
Buffon————————
Motta———Bonucci———Chiellini———Criscito
Krasic/Martinez—Palombo/Melo—Marchisio—Pepe
-———-Del Piero—New striker—————
If we go cheap we will have a midfield of Martinez, Melo, Marchisio and Pepe. Hardly a world class midfield but one that is full of discipline (maybe except Melo). If we want to spend more money we will have Krasic, Palombo, Marchisio and Pepe. A brand new midfield that can compete with the clubs that finished 2nd-6th last season.

Exactly. This team simply has too many holes to bring in a superstar at every position. The goal for this mercato is to plug those holes to build a solid squad. Ideally, next season we’ll have the additional money from CL as well as less holes to fill. That’s when Juventus can focus on buying truly world-class players.

2010 Transfer Target Player Profiles: Milos Krasic,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 5, 2010, 12:38am PDT",,"Rinaldo, who would you have rather signed for left mid realistically. We weren’t going to get Robben or Ribery, they wouldn’t come even with crazy high salaries. Pepe is not that bad of an option. If he does better than expected he can become a starter, if not he will be a descent back up for the 2011-2012 season.
As for Marotta’s view that last year’s form is not indicative I think what he means is that you have to see why a player failed to impress last season. Amauri was given plenty of chances but the system didn’t suit him, should we keep him or not (I personally don’t think so). Marco Motta hardly got playing time and in Del Neri’s system he might flourish, let’s give the kid a chance.
Marotta has reason to say something like that. Look at Cassano, he had a horrible season at Madrid, Marotta took him to Sampdoria and he will be leading them to the CL next year, not bad for someone that had a sucky season. A big part of how a player performs is related to the formation, the ambiance in the team (read Alessio’s post on Felipe Melo), the expectations placed on him (look at Almiron).
I wished we would have gotten Robben, Ribery, Puyol, Pique, Vidic, Dzeko, Alvez, etc. but it wasn’t going to happen. Let’s give Marotta and Andrea a little bit of room to work.

Think about it – we have Giovinco and Diego, two players I rate higher than Pepe, and we are going to get rid of them in order to include Pepe – just because the latter fits the coach’s preferred formation?
Also, Pepe is a right-mid, not left, which means I doubt we’ll be signing Krasic/Martinez/any other right winger.

Of the coaches that we could have hired only Allegri plays the 4-3-1-2. I think Prandelli loves the Viola way too much to move to Juve right away. After his time with La Nazionale he might be easier to convince.
The point is that our coach now is Del Neri, and he plays a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3, not much else. This means Diego and Giovinco are probably going to leave and we are going to have to get wingers (I don’t think Giovinco suits Del Neri’s type of game). Of the wingers available Pepe is a realistic target given our situation (a rebuilding team that is not playing in the CL next year in a League that has lost its appeal to big name players).
You say Pepe plays as a right wing which means no Krasic, if that is the case I apologize, to be honest I don’t know what position Pepe plays in, I just heard he plays as a left or right winger or as a left or right forward, that is why I had Pepe and Krasic on the same team. Krasic only plays in the right wing.
And Alessio, I think comparing Pepe to Molinaro is a little bit of a stretch. And all in all, Molinaro was not that much worse than Grosso. And at least he was easier to watch than Amauri and Cannavaro who clearly don’t care about the team.
Pepe is a signing for this season to help us qualify to CL, next year a more capable left winger will be purchased to cover that hole.
I think Marotta is trying to buy one world class defender, one world class midfielder and one world class forward. Everyone else that comes to Juve will be to start closing holes in our system and for depth in the seasons to come. I think we will see Bonucci come as the world class defender, Krasic or someone of that caliber (young and a little unproven in big leagues, but with potential) for midfield and a forward for 20m to 30m, if and only if we sell Diego, if not say goodbye to the forward.

Compare it to how Thomas Muller for Bayern plays with Olic… Olic stays upfront as a target man (although he sometimes excessively runs around laterally chasing down the ball) and Muller always drops of into midfield to pressure the opposition holding midfielder(s)

2010 Transfer Target Player Profiles: Milos Krasic,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 5, 2010, 12:38am PDT",,"I just read an awesome interview of Zaccheroni.
He talks about everything from what went wrong, his opinion on Mou, ADP presumably being a locker-room cancer(Zac says he NEVER had any issues with him), what he thinks of Melo, Diego and their futures etc etc etc.
Some very interesting excerpts:
-“Diego is a very talented player who unfortunately wasn’t able to settle in. HE IS GOING TO BE SOLD. When Del Neri arrived at Porto, he said: ‘Diego? Great talent but with me he’s not playing…’”
-When asked whether all of the players supported his choice as a manager post-Ferrara and if they all were willing to help out, Zaccheroni said:
“All of them except for one. He came up to me and said: ‘Coach, I’m here but don’t count on me.’”
-When asked about what he thought of the recent moves at Juventus(Agnelli, Marotta, Paratici etc), Alberto “dropped the bomb”:
“Juve is putting together a huge/great team. THIS IS VERY MUCH DUE TO THE FACT THAT ANTONIO GIRAUDO, CONTINUES TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE FORTUNES OF AGNELLI. I believe Juventus will be the real antagonist to Inter next season.”
Two things that really got me thinking after this:
1)Who was that player who openly told Zac he couldn’t count on him? Most people believe it was probably Camo.
2)If Giraudo is in charge/helping out Andrea, then we are in fucking fantastic hands. With the return of an Agnelli, we have Antonio’s return also. Can anybody guess who else is missing to complete the picture?
In Andrea we trust.

Giraudo is someone who as a director together with Moggi, has guided and seen his team win everything possible and become the best in the world in the mid to late 90’s, so he’s definitely someone you’d want calling shots and advising.
If this is indeed true, it also shows that Andrea is completely different from his tranny-loving cousins(who don’t give a flying fuck about Juve and don’t want to have anything to do with the pre-Calciopoli period) and wants to rely on the expertise of the former Triade to take the team back to the top.",Jorid ,"Jun 6, 2010 ", 8:28 PM,

2010 Transfer Target Player Profiles: Milos Krasic,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 5, 2010, 12:38am PDT",,"We should play a 4-4-1-1, which is what Diego played at Bremen, and it would work excellently. Del Neri likes the 4-4-2, and this is the same thing basically, just with a more withdrawn striker. Diego would thrive here, as well as the wingers, so it would give us alot more depth in attack, plus Diego likes to track back, and the wingers could track back too, so it would give us alot of defensive cover as well. Sign Krasic, and we’d have Camoranesi, Giovinco, Brazzo, Candreva, and Krasic all in the same squad available as wingers or trequartistas, as well as possibly Pepe. Even though i would prefer Marin over either Krasic or Pepe, i still think these would be good moves. Then all we need to do is sign Caceres and Candreva, bring back Ariaudo, and sign a good center forward with good technical skills. Signing a good centerback would also be a good idea, as Ariaudo is still very young and inexperienced, but this is all easily possible, especially if we get rid of the guys we dont need like Poulsen, Amauri, Grygera, Zebina, and Grosso. Personally, i think our squad should, and could very easily look like this next season:
Buffon
Caceres—Bocchetti—Chiellini—Criscito
Krasic—-Marchisio—-Sissoko—-Giovinco
-——————-Diego
-——————-Cacau
This would be amazing. And we’d still have alot of depth on the bench as well, with Manninger, Salihamidzic, Ariaudo, Legrottaglie, De Ceglie, Camoranesi, Candreva, Melo, Pepe, Iaquinta, Del Piero, Trezeguet. Even a squad full of subs, like this:
Manninger
Brazzo—Ariaudo—Legro—De Ceglie
Camo——Candreva——Melo——Pepe
-————-Del Piero
-———Iaquinta/Trezeguet
So even if we dont get Pepe, we’d still have a very strong squad even with strictly only using our subs, as Iaquinta is also able to play as a winger if need be. That is one hell of a strong squad.",Armando ,"Jun 8, 2010 ", 4:47 PM,

Although it was done by Gazzetta della Internazionale, I mean Sport, it was simultaneously interesting and somewhat of a disappointment IMO.
The Cliffs Notes from it were:
“Having to manage a few personal friends was very difficult.”
“Del Piero wants to play all the time and at times this can be a real problem. I can see it being a problem next season also.”
“The arrogance that Felipe Melo displayed throughout training made a few other players angry and this was at times visible even during games.”
“Diego is a talented player and should definitely be kept. He does however, need 2 mobile forwards that can make deep runs in order to display his abilities.”
“Hearing a few players say ‘Now that Zac is the coach, we are really training well’, or ‘We are finally working on our tactics’, while Zac had a points/game average worse than me definitely angered me. THOSE WHO HAD THE FACE TO SAY THESE THINGS, DESPITE THE TEAM NOT IMPROVING SUBSTANTIALLY ARE JACKASSES.”
Before some people here begin their “ADP is finished, he’s a dressing-room cancer” shpiel lol, there is a few things that bother me.
-Why didn’t Ferrara bench ADP if his desire to play at all times was such a problem? And don’t give me that “it’s hard to bench your former teammate and friend” bullshit.

-Wasn’t ADP our top scorer this season at the age of almost 36?

Ok, nice and all they went well on this video and created good plays, but on another day that one guy might have not slipped and then intercepted your ball, or that one time that you tried to dribble a guy in a dangerous situation some other dude doubled up on u and intercepted the ball (see Juve-Siena)… He tries too much to make that beautiful Xavi-like killer pass, or to do that marvelous C.Ronaldo dribble past 3 opponents instead of KEEPING IT SIMPLE and leaving such things to players like Diego or Giovinco (when he plays ofc) and doing his job: protecting defense and keeping it simple… Maybe cuz he was expected to be a regista…. i dunno, but I don’t particularly like it….",Forza Juve ,"Jun 4, 2010 ", 3:25 PM,

Right now we are building a team to compete against Milan, Roma, Sampdoria and Palermo. Pepe will help us build towards that and might be a useful reserve once we get a better quality winger.
Motta I think is better than people give him credit for. Don’t get me wrong, I think Caceres is better right now, but I don’t think he is worth $11m. Caceres is worth 7 or 8m tops. Hopefully we don’t pay more than 6m for Motta. Motta needs time and he will be better than Grygera and Zebina. Caceres + Motta will be a good pairing on the right wing.
I also think that if Barcelona can’t sell Caceres he might come back on loan again, but we will have to wait until the end of August.",Jose ,"Jun 4, 2010 ", 5:03 PM,

If we have two wingers (that are not of Pepe’s quality) on the side then his passing may get better.
I think Melo’s performance is very dependent on the coach he plays for and on his self-confidence. I can assure you that if Benitez was on our bench, Melo would have been one of the best players at Juve next season.

But I think Melo will probably do well pairing Marchisio in a 4-4-2 with some pacey wingers. And as much as I’d love a regista, Del Neri’s tactics don’t really require it. He likes attack minded wingers and a solid center midfield. For this, Melo will do well I think.
And in Italy, teams almost always play with at least one mediano. So if Juve signed a regista, he’d be paired with a mediano, not Marchisio…especially since Juve’s wingers will be very attack minded. So a regista isn’t necessary right now.",Anthony ,"Jun 7, 2010 ", 7:53 PM,

On another point, it astonishes me that Marchisio was selected for the world cup squad but our very own Amauri was not. A man known for his predatory insincts and slaved away 4 years just so he can get italian citizenship was overlooked despite his great commitment for Italy. OK u can say that Amauri had a poor season, but which juve player didnt, even Diego the £20mill man was poor throughout. Its clear the juve formation/system/tactics was at fault not our Amauri. I think that we can all say that when Amauri is on form such as his palermo days, we all know he can score goals for fun.

However we need to resolve the co-ownership deals by June 26th I believe (correct me if I am wrong). I think at that point we will know more about Criscito, Palladino, Bonnuci and Rannochia since Genoa owns them both. If we don’t buy Rannochia or Bonucci by the 26th I think we will go for Kjaer or someone else that is not the Bari boys.
I think more than psychological games Marotta is trying to feel the market, ie. what is Giovinco’s real value, what is Diego’s real value?, which market is better for him: Germany vs. La Liga?, who can we get that will fit our game philosophy?. I think he is lining up his ducks to take them all down very quickly. By now he probably knows what are Zamparini’s real intentions as well as Presiozi’s, he probably knows how badly Spanish teams want Diego and so on and so forth.
You have to remember that Marotta is not Moggi, who worked in a Napoli that was very powerful and had good contacts with big teams. Marotta came from Sampdoria and he is used to dealing with small clubs and bringing in players that have failed before and integrating them into a winning team. Marotta has never bought a player worth more than 20 million I don’t think and it will take time until he can get his connections going with the big teams. It is also not like he has Secco’s strong business foundations to fall back on.
Also, our club needs to get rid of some players before buying others. I think Marotta’s big goal right now is to relocate Diego, hopefully somewhere where we can get a player that will suit our needs. On top of that he is rebuilding the defense as a priority. Regista and striker will come after defense and after placing Diego somewhere else.",Jose ,"Jun 3, 2010 ", 10:11 AM,

Shipping your cargo internationally via ocean transportation from the United States to the Caribbean; to destinations such as Anguilla, Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, St. Thomas, St. Vincent, and shipping to trinidad; can be an intimidating and confusing process for many but this can be avoided by following some easy steps.
1.) Always ship to the Caribbean with an ocean freight company that is licensed to do shipping.
There are different types of companies that provide international ocean transportation services. These include freight forwarders, non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCC) and vessel operating common carriers (VOCC). Sometimes they are referred to an ocean logistics company.
2.) Ship with an ocean transportation company that is experienced in the type of items you wish to ship. There are many types of items you can ship; such as personal effects, barrels, less than container loads (LCL), full containerloads (FCL), boats, machinery and vehicles. Shipping companies experienced in shipping specific types of shipments will better understand the documentation requirements and procedures in order to maintain compliance, for example. They will also be in a better position to provide you with a competitive rate quotation.
3.) Ship with an ocean company that specializes in shipping to the Caribbean and has a good company representative at the country where the cargo is destined.
4.) Ask for references of customers that previously used their shipping services so you may contact them and get a first-hand experience and opinion on how this shipping company performed.
5.) Ask for your quotation in writing and review closely any terms and conditions.
Following the above pointers are some of the ways you can improve your shipping experience to the Caribbean and any destination for that matter.",Trinidad ,"Jun 9, 2010 ", 8:41 PM,

You cannot control the foreign player dilemma with regulations, people. Remember, football is, as much as we dislike to admit it, a business. Supply-Demand. The be competitive in the continent, there’s tremendous pressure on these teams (thus demand). There are gazillions of players from poorer countries of the world who look at Europe as the golden ticket (thus supply). When a nation like Brazil produces several thousand players who are world class, and can be bought (if one hurries to buy them before they come to Europe) for a fraction of a native player of similar abilities, the market decides what’s going to happen. Regulations without an economic or rational basis have always failed against much greater forces. This doesn’t change.
About the “foreigners are invading so native players can’t go through” argument: this is an old, old argument, and everyone laments about it, almost everywhere. Take a look at Turkish or Greek newspapers: they’re full of similar complaints. The EPL is the most foreign-friendly league of all, and yet English academies are producing world-class players all the time, and they get action in first-11s of EPL teams, and go to the national team (not that the English national team ever looks, feels, or plays like a team!).
The solution is not restrictive, bound-to-fail regulations; it is investment in infrastructure, in better youth scouting and outreach facilities/teams, in opening regional academies (for the larger clubs that can certainly afford it), etc.

Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"juvealways….I’m pretty sure La Liga has less foreigners than Serie A.
I like the idea of having a reserve league or second squads. But Italy has always used a primavera youth system and it has always been important. Some youth players need to be nurtured more slowly and play against people their own age first, then slowly move up to playing against more experienced players.",Anthony ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 10:53 PM,
Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"juvealways….the example you used about buying players from Brazil for a fraction of the price of a native player is not entirely true. I agree that there are a lot of good Brazilian players, but are they all significantly better than young Italian players that develop in teams youth systems….I’m not so sure. There are PLENTY of South American players who have flopped big time in Italy. For some reason there is just that mentality that young South American players are better than young Italian players.
The problem isn’t that too many foreigners are in Serie A. The problem is that too many CRAPPY foreigners are in Serie A. I understand playing top class foreign players ahead of young Italians. But what’s the point of playing crappy foreigners ahead of them too? Why even buy them in the first place?",Anthony ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 11:01 PM,
Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"Regarding the reserve or second teams again….I think what would be easier than having a Juve B team that plays in Serie B would be having a reserve league where all the teams in Serie A have reserve teams and compete against each other. So instead of loaning out players to other teams, players can play in the reserve league for experience. Because right now, when a player is too old to play for the primavera, the only options are to promote them to the first team, loan them or sell them. And if you do any of those, there’s no guarantee the player will play regularly. A reserve team would help solve that problem. Second teams in Serie B would be good too, but it’ll be too hard to make that happen I think as it won’t be so easy to add new teams to lower divisions. To create a reserve league though, all that really needs to be done is to create an additional level above the Primavera.
The teams would be consisted of a combination of young players that normally would have gone out on loan to play but now don’t have to, and fringe players from the first team that play in the reserve league to still play competitively. So players like Giovinco who are on the fringe of the first team would still get opportunities to play in competitive games instead of sitting on the bench.",Anthony ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 11:23 PM,
Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"I thought I’d post this link to an article I read last year about Italian youth policies. It makes quite a few valid points about how youth are nurtured by being loaned out to smaller teams where there is less pressure. I agree with a lot of what is said. But there is only so much space for young players even in the small teams. The presence of a reserve league would help this a lot I think. But the author makes good points about how the youth who break into first teams in Serie A tend to be the real deal. Check out the article:

Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"Anthony: I agree with most of what you’ve said. The reason, however, that even mediocre foreign players are put in front of young Italian players is not some sort of foreign mystique; compare the risks of nurturing a young player, giving him chances, etc with just buying a 25 year old average foreign player. I’m not advocating this, I’m just saying it as it is, like old Machiavelli used to, so don’t blame the messenger. :)
I know there are lots of young Italian players with great talent; my point was that foreign players of similar caliber can be bought cheaper compared to developing them at home. It’s both human nature and market dynamics to go for the easiest, not best, solution. I agree that something needs to be done about it, but it’s not regulations.
By the way, here are some statistics on foreign player percentage:
http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/default/gastarbeiterstartseite/basics.html
As we can see, Serie A is #18 in that list (when arranged to be viewed on %Foreign Players). Spain is #20, so you were right, but my point remains: Serie A is not among the more foreign player populated leagues, after all.",juvealways ,"Aug 3, 2010 ", 9:20 AM,
Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"You’re right that teams just do what’s easier. One thing I think is also that teams prefer to go with more experience since that offers a certain guarantee….even if the player himself isn’t necessarily more skilled than an Italian option. I think there are some regulations that can be put in place to help that though. Something to give the teams some sort of incentive to play Italian players over foreigners.
Thanks for that link. If we look at that list, we can see that Brazil have some of fewest foreigners compared to the other leagues. Hence the reason why there is a large quantity of good Brazilian players. I don’t necessarily think they are all better than Italian options…but I do think there is a greater quantity of them because they get to play so much. If Italy reduced the amount of foreign players in Serie A, Italy should start producing a larger quantity of good players as well.",Anthony ,"Aug 3, 2010 ", 8:05 PM,
Gasperini Speaks About Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 30, 2010, 11:25pm PDT",,"I think the reason behind Brazil’s status as a player export powerhouse is two things:
1) 200 million people (China or India or even the USA has more, but this is the single largest footballing nation in the world, where football is and has been popular for a long time)
2) Massive poverty, where becoming a football player is one of the few tickets out.
Even in European national teams, look at the players, and a majority of them come from lower class, low income families. Remember the great Roberto Baggio.
As poverty decreases in Europe (not that it’s gone, it’s still there) avenues for a successful career become more abundant, and attractive to people who would otherwise have had great football careers. In Brazil, for a majority of the population, the chances of becoming a doctor or engineer with an amateur hobby in footbal is less of an option than in Italy, I’d say.",juvealways ,"Aug 3, 2010 ", 11:06 PM,

Storari
Motta Bonucci Chiellini De Ceglie
Italian, and Storari is the only one over 25. Not bad.
Didn’t catch the game, but it sounds alright. Seriously though, Shamrock Rovers is a good team in an absolute crap league. Like I wonder if they’d even be Serie B caliber. So consider we just beat Albinoleffe 2-0. Decent, but not really that impressive. We beat better teams like Lazio 2-0 and Roma 3-1 last August and look how the season ended up…expectations need to be low this season.
And that goes for the players I’m not a fan like Amauri, as well as players I do like ie De Ceglie. Still have it all to prove, and while a good outing against Shamrock is nice and all, let’s see what happens when they’re up against better opposition. Last year Amauri was shackled by Knezevic, for God’s sake.
If there is good news about Amauri ( http://juventus.theoffside.com/team-news/the-rebirth-of-amauri.html ) it’s that he’s a striker that depends on confidence, probably too much. And 2 goals to start out should help the confidence levels.",agiamba ,"Jul 29, 2010 ", 2:44 PM,

actually amauri scored 6 in all comps last season…amauri is sooo much better than iaquinta, its just that he was out of form last yr, but everyone else knows that he is world class, and will be back to his best next season after his midnight training sessions. my inside sources proved to be correct.
wheras iaquinta plays shit for juve and italy, and is injured all the time, picking up wages for nothing, which could be spent much more usefully elsewhere such as on other transfers.
amauri has always had the ability, unfortunately agaimba fans such as yourself and others decided to turn against him, inevitably causing any striker when theyre down to lose even more confidence….but now hes back! amauri is officially now the king of turin, and more people are begining to agree with my views.","Gurnam ""bigman"" ","Jul 30, 2010 ", 5:39 AM,

I’m having a really tough time believing that Lanzafame is a better winger then Gio, but Gio is a lost cause and not worth discussing at this point.

The problem with Gio is he needs someone to cover his back due to his small size. He can probably take on his defender 5/10 times or be fouled by a defender 4/10 times. However, there is that one time that if someone takes the ball from him cleanly and the left back has moved up the field the opposition will have an open corridor to run and cross and can be very problematic.

So in conclusion why would you kick out a better player than the ones you have brought in? and that in itself is enough to prove marotta’s stupidity. Del neri should have learnt his lesson last year when juve thrashed sampdoria thanks to diego and giovinco. Given the lack of creativity in the present team marotta should have been looking for players better than camo and giovinco particularly in the crossing department and I fail to see how pepe and martinez are better particularly when del neri has so often stated that he always wants to play a 4-4-2 or a 4-4-1-1.",Vikram ,"Jul 26, 2010 ", 12:54 PM,

For this reason, players like Giovinco who thrive on being given freedom in a formation would not work in Del Neri’s system.

Three years ago, we hoped to be at a different level, last year we thought we were ready to beat, but unfortunately it was not so. Now, it’s right to understand where we messed up and start all over again.”

Inevitably, the question was asked about what Juve’s objectives were, and also in this case Chiellini stayed low. “It depends on the objective that we want to reach. Realistically, after lastyear, it is difficult to imagine winning soon. The distance with Inter, which was always the biggest, is enormous. The fans need to realize that it’s a year of construction, a year zero. There will be moments in which we suffer the next few years. I’d be happy to say today that we will win the Scudetto or that we are on the level with Inter, but that would be hiding it from the tifosi. The minimum objective is the Champions League, to not do it would be very poor. We are working hard, and we are starting to learn how to do what our coach demands, but we need some time. Also, Delneri has said that we need team to build anything.”

Signings- In defense, there are 3 CBs right now, there are Chiellini, Bonucci, and Legrottaglie. Some critics say it’s not enough. And there are two days from the first official match, two CBs are out. Legro for a flu problem, and Bonucci for a knee problem. Chiellini, however, does seem worried, at least in the moment. “The team knows how to move. Bonucci is returning, we are three plus Ferrero who can give us a hand. if we are all well for the first part of the season, there isn’t a problem. But to play the whole season, a 4th CB is necessary. What will be the first-team in defense? I don’t know. We’re alternating, there hasn’t been a fixed team.”

Other than signings, Chiellini was asked about the many players possibly leaving, Camoranesi and Grosso above all. He was asked how they are dealing with the situation. “Honestly, we don’t speak a lot about it in the locker room, but I can say that everyone is calm. There’s a lot of rumors, but we need to see what is true first. Other than Buffon and Del Piero, we’ve all been placed everywhere. Above all, I have a great desire to recover. The duty is shared among all, and I’m sure the coach, his staff, and trainers say the same.”

The rumors about a possible departure of Chiellini have circled, but he directly denies them all. And he says for the contract renewal, it’s only a matter of time. ""I’ve never thought about leaving, I’ve talked with the club and they have confirmed me as an important member. Until we sit down, and talk in person, there of course can be doubts. I had the World Cup to think about, though, and I didn’t want to talk about the contract until after. In the next few days, we’ll meet with Marotta. There is no problem, if there’s the desire of all members to reach an agreement, the agreement will be found even if we have to wait a week. With the ""if""s and “buts” I don’t see any point. The reality is that I am very tied to Juventus as a club, and also as a fan. I arrived here little more than a child, and here I have become a man and grown as a player. The tie is very strong, and I think I will remain here for many years, but my future I cannot say, because it also depends on what the club plans.",agiamba ,"Jul 27, 2010 ", 9:44 AM,

Haha! Hilarious!
Re: Giovinco, of the players from the 2008-2009 U-21/U23 team, he is definitely the most talented; so there’s no exaggeration of his abilities by us fans. Why he hasn’t seen as much playing time as the others, in my opinion, is down to his size. Granted there are small players who are/have been greats, but players like Maradona, Messi for example are very strong and are extremely hard to knock off the ball. Gio doesn’t have that, and while getting freekicks is good, it becomes too easy for a defender(s) to limit Gio by just outmuscling him. I want him to stay, but for his sake he should go where faith will be put in him.

For twenty cash, we could probably get pazzini, who will help us build the itajuve we desire.
For 30 we could probably get pazzini, and a solid leftback.
It would be nice to have a player like dzeko though. From watching his games, there is no questioning that he s the real deal. It d be like buying a Ferrari.",Gaetano ,"Jul 28, 2010 ", 9:28 AM,

Player Ratings: Juventus Season 2009-2010,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 23, 2010, 3:53pm PDT",,"Del Neri’s presser-
""We cannot take making it through the round of the Europa League for granted because we will be playing with 11 men against 11. We saw from the World Cup match against New Zealand how physique can create problems and we will be playing against a good team which is coming from a championship like the Irish one and therefore nothing is yet sure"". Gigi Del Neri, on the eve of the friendly match in Cosenza against Lyon is already looking at the match against Shamrock Rovers valid for the Europa League preliminaries: ""We would have been working for a month and even though they played more they will be ready. As from tomorrow in Cosenza, some players will play for more then one half because in the Europa League we will have only 3 changes and therefore 8 will have to play the whole match. If the internationals will be playing against Lyon? We’ll see. They have been training for a week and therefore they could play for 20 to 30 minutes"".

Del Neri is satisfied with how the preparation is proceeding: ""I like the players’ attitude, the conviction, the application and the attention that they are putting into training. They are all anxious to give the maximum on the field. Who surprised me the most? I’d say the strikers: if I ask them to make long runs they suffer more then the midfielders but do not hold back. I appreciate very much their commitment on the field. The group is forming but we are trying to change on a tactics level in comparison to the past and therefore a lot of work is needed"".

Del Neri is very careful with regards to the defensive aspect and the players of that department are being asked to be solid: ""They must have precise duties and it is important that they move in harmony not as single players. I want a defence that knows how to work on its own without help from the midfield. There might be the case when the midfield is beaten and the defenders must make up on their own"".

With regards to the attack, the coach underlined that he has not chosen the starting duo: ""All the strikers give me great guarantees. I will choose according to the moment and their merit"". The subject then shifted to the transfer market: ""The attack and the midfield are the less urgent matters. In front we have 5 players who last year were considered of a high level and I don’t think they have expired, in fact I see them as having a great will to do well. The same goes for the midfield where the four central midfielders are international players. We will see if the transfer market offers any players capable of improving our defence"".

Soon for the midfield Del Neri will also have Felipe Melo available: ""How to help him recover? By convincing him that he is an important player and convincinh him to work hard to recover his condition"". Asked whether the club has given him a minimum objective to reach, the coach answered: ""No, because what could it be? Ending second or third? The final objective is irrelevant if you have one every Sunday. The objectives must be there each week because if you win the matches you also win the championship…"".

Del Neri wants to create a great Juve and to do so he is also being inspired by past teams: ""I think of the Juve of Tardelli, Bonini, Cabrini…of a club that used to choose young players but with a winning mentality. We must build a group that is strong and homogenous and that can keep up with the passage of time"". With regards to his colleagues, Del Neri explained that instead he ""he learnt and tried to understand all the coaches he had and who he saw at work. The passion of Trapattoni, the pragmatism of Lippi, the human values of Nereo Rocco… Football is not only technique and tactics but also the will, enthusiasm and passion for the work. Mourinho? When one wins so much there must be a reason. I coached Porto for one month. It was his creation: he is a great worker and an excellent psychologist.

The good news is that the components are starting to work. Diego, is looking pretty fucking amazing and maybe its like jiji has said, he’ll need speed on the wings to help him along. I certainly feel as if something is starting to click after watching 3 of the last friendles.
However, because of last season, I’m refraining from getting overly excited. It will take a hell of a lot more good results for me to be convinced that this team isn’t at any moment going to self implode.

Player Ratings: Juventus Season 2009-2010,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 23, 2010, 3:53pm PDT",,"One things I noticed in the game against Lyon is that we were organized. Last season, specially towards the end the players didn’t know what they were doing, they had played the 4-3-1-2, 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 3-4-3, etc that no one knew where they were supposed to be. Against Lyon I saw our players making runs that made sense, be it on defense or attack. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think we will win the scudetto or that we are even going to be able to contest it with Inter but it seems like Del Neri knows a little more about coaching than Ferrara and Zac, and for that matter Ranieri.
I was also watching the last goal. I noticed two things, Grygera runs up the wing and confuses the defender who gives Pepe a bit of space. Pepe passes to Diego who has 2 or 3 seconds to lift the ball and play the perfect pass for Pepe to score. Although it was a beautiful goal there are 2 things to take from that.
1) Pepe played faster than both Lanzaframe and Martinez (maybe the Lyon players were tired after playing one man down for so long) and that created problems on defense and space for Diego.
2) If Diego gets two seconds on the ball he can cause some damage, if he gets five seconds he can be lethal. The difference is that most serie A sides will not have given Diego the amount of space he got in that second goal. They would be closer to him and probably would have fouled him before he could pass the ball. The solution for that is that Diego needs to practice his free kicks or we need a player who can consistently score free kicks (ADP two years ago for instance).
The one player who encompasses point 1 and 2 is Giovinco. He is faster than Pepe, Martinez, and Lanzaframe (never mind technically better by a large margin), and also he can shoot free kicks better than Diego can.
I know some of you feel that he hasn’t done anything to deserve the attention he gets on a regular basis but he also hasn’t gotten the chance. If GDN doesn’t want to use him then he should go on loan or co-ownership. But I hope GDN tries him in 1 or 2 games before making up his mind. He gave Trez and Diego a chance and they have shown their potential, maybe Giovinco will too.",Jose ,"Jul 25, 2010 ", 2:22 AM,

I’d just like to see diego and giovinco play in the same team like the ‘doria game. You can’t blame players like amauri and trez for not playing well though…they had zero service. Del p is aging and should be confined to the bench for most of the games this season and I don’t understand del neri…lanzafame clearly doesn’t want to play winger and yet he plays him in that position and he has a natural in giovinco and he doesn’t want to play him.

WE MUST NOT USE ADP AS A STARTER AT ALL – AT ALL!
As i saw last night we started something new as project which can give us needed results. Don’t fool yourself from 1-2 nice touches, ADP can’t manage the frontline like before – stuppid!

Even that Trez didn’t touch the ball last night is visible that he’s the one who knows how,where and when to be in the box in JUve.He just waited his moment- that his job.
We sill need a new striker, having in mind AMAURI presentation (terrible as usual),ADP speed and movement and IAQUINTA constant injuries. I DO BELIEVE WE’LL BUY PAZZINI AT THE END OF AUGUST – HE’LL BE PERFECT ADDITION TO THIS YOUNG TEAM.
Lastly – DIEGO – I’m big admirer to the guy,huge one. Last night he prove my words that if he has young and fast players around him he can do magic.

Maybe he was consistent in giving the same performances without efficiency. He looked like he was doing a lot, but in fact nothing came out of it most of the time. In contrast, I think that Giovinco was not given a chance but every time he was on he looked very dangerous and likely to create chances. You see I don’t care about running diagonally or sideways, and dribbling past three or four people in the middle of the park when you cannot deliver in front of goal.

- Del Piero 5, best days are clearly behind him and should not be in contention to be a starter in this stage of his career. He’s proving me right every time he plays that he can’t lead our frontline anymore, he’s too slow and old.
- Legro 5, one of Alessio’s favourite and even though he’s a good role model I don’t rate him highly as a footballer.
- Iaquinta 4 (if he was a sub 5.5 but as a starter he was really poor and wasteful)
- Diego 5.5, he should not feel good about some of his performances last year, He should also shoulder some of the blame for Juve’s poor season last year because of him we had to change formations and Giovinco being overlooked.

I present to you our pacey, attack minded wingers:
-Molinaro
-Grosso
-PDC
-Zebina
-Caceres
-Grygera
Out of those 6 I think only Caceres is worthy of the words pacey and attack minded, maybe PDC on a good day. The others should not be setting foot in our stadium
As for our creative regista we had Felipe Melo, since Secco masterfully killed the deal for D’Agostino and sold Zannetti in a period of weeks (he should have been fired right there, along with any moron that supported his decision).
40% of the chances might be low for some people or high for other, and that is a different argument altogether. 40% given what Diego had to work with is impressive. His best games came when he was flanked by Giovinco and Camo (both real pacey and attack minded players). If we are going to blame Diego saying the system was built around him then at least lets build something worthy around him.

Neo is completely correct when he said that the system was built around Diego and him being responsible for 40% should be the least expected when taking into account that all the play was supposed to go through him.
Diego should stay IF he can fit into the 4-4-2. If he cant fit into the formation then he should be sold. I love seeing Diego play but I love seeing Juventus win a lot more.

Also I disagree with folks who said that we’re can’t afford him. His contract is due to expire July 2011 and it’s look like he’s not renewing. Werder forced to sell him now, or next Jan, if they don’t want to lose him for free come 2011. I’d say, roughly, Werder wouldn’t say no to any potential bid worth 20M Euros, or a little less than that.
The problem is, (1) we’re not really seriously linked with him; and (2) whether he really want us?
But all in all, if we’re going for a creative force, whether it on the centre, SS, or flanks, he’d be our best bet in the market with respect to other candidates.
As for the LB situation, after Kolarov gone off the radar, I think we should go for Tremoulinas. The guy could come cheap (I think his market value is at 10 M Euros, or less).
Tremoulinas strenghts is that he’s fast, composed, and comfortable on the ball with great crossing, fantastic acceleration, all of these comes with a great technique package.
Weaknesses could be his defense abilities. With a small stature, I see him kinda easy to be bullied at with opposition’s strong forwards/wingers.
Cissokho? He’s not on the market. Lyon bought him only last summer with a staggering 17 M Euros. And the press linking him with us with a reported bid of 15M E..lol. Not gonna happen.

1.ATM we are really weak at LB, de ceglie looks better further up-the-field(LWB?)and has not shown the defensive awareness required of a LB…grosso is definitely past his BB date
on the wings,i am not yet impressed by any of our signings, the best options for now in a 4-4-2 are IMO opinion camoranesi on the right and giovinco on the left. the jury is still out on lanzafamme, martinez & pepe…this does not rule out the possibility of one or all three of them coming good; but i think it’s better to be safe than sorry and get one TRULY-DECENT winger
2. unless del neri plans to start chiellini at LB, i’m assuming that our CB’s will be bonucci & chiellini with legrotagglie as a sub. that would mean that save for 1/2 players from the primavera we are short of options in that position. i therefore think we shuld sign a CB who is not uncomfortable in the knowledge that he will be starting from the bench
3. i really feel we are okay in midfield n even if we lose poulsen/tiago, ekdal/marrone should be promoted. since the emphasis on attacking play under GDN will be coming from the wide players, our current midfield roster seems fine by me
4. we NEED to sign a striker with the same profile as the CB i described. iaquinta’s frequent niggles with injury is worrisome and he IMO is at best a good sub.
amauri continues to flatter to deceive and i think the earlier we r rid of him the better (there’s a little glimmer of hope in my heart that he will surprise us, but i’ not holding my breath)

In all honesty, i dont get rude to people untill they get rude to me, if im writing stuff about amauri and then people call me gay for doing so, then your gonna have to expect some shit going your way, because otherwise it is just harsh on me. I believe im being victimised by the authors of these posts who are now just deleting my comments.

10 reasons to support amauri:
1. his hair are like beautiful locks swinging across his face everytime he scores and celebrates, giving him a warrior type image.
2. his facial hair gives makes him look like a tough guy with his own version of stone cold steve austins famous beard.
3. his body is a work of art and sculptured to perfection with his chest being as wide as a house, hence the amauri/chielline chest celebrations.
4. he has modelling contracts across the world and women love him. One even offered her services to Amauri for free, in hope that amauri would touch her, as he has the midas touch.
5. He has taken the number 11 shirt like a duck to water, and wears it better than former players like nedeved. whilst he is also currently juve’s most important striker ahead of iaquinta, ADP and Trez.
6. Amauri is better than iaquinta endof. as Iaquinta always sits on his arse on a hospital bed, picking up wages for doing nothing.
7. Amauri has great finishing ability, such was the case during palermo, and his first year at juve. The system most recently has not favoured him, but from inside sources, he has been the best player in training under del neri and will be lethal next season.
8. There are photos and videos of him naked on the net. Take a look, he is very large indeed. : heres the link -http://blog.stripperboyz.net/2008/08/amauri-carvalho-de-oliveira-naked.html?zx=42fd9e584fff6b90
9. its always great to sing amauri chants such as this:
AMAURRIII WHOOAAA
AMAURIII WHOAAAA
HE SCORES GOALS FOR FUN!!
HE FUCKS IAQUINTA IN THE BUM!!!
AMAURI WHOOOAAA
AMAURIII WHOAAAA
10. Also it is great to support amauri as you always feel as you are part of a community, in his recruitment agency. Supporting amauri is the way foward, and the fact that he is juve’s most important striker currently, suggests that it is time for us all to have great faith in Amauri’s ability as footballer and a sex god.","Gurnam ""bigman"" ","Jul 22, 2010 ", 11:03 AM,

If we keep Diego then we need to sell either Amauri or Iaquinta.
The likelihood that Amauri or Iaquinta will have a “break through year” is very slim. I hear people saying that we need to wait but I think we should buy a striker this summer. What will happen next year when amauri is still sucking and Iaquinta is still injured. I think with a strike force of Diego,Trez, and Alex..we will be good enough to get a CL spot, but what if there are injuries? And if we had a mobile striker up top, Diego will be less injured. He will have an easier time feeding the ball through,and we will have someone who can actually put it on the back of the net.
I actually think Lanzafame could be this years revelation. If played corrrectly,he can be very effective. I think we shouldn t buy a winger as we are covered already. Pdc,lanzafame,camo,martinez,pepe,andgiovinco are enough depth in that department. We need a leftback and a mobile striker,the latter being essential if we are keeping Diego.
Diego and Trez is not enough,ADP and TREZ is not enough, and we know the story of Aladdin and Vincenzo.

I think the agreed price was 6.5million, but it’s not the transfer fee they’re haggling over, it’s Tiago’s salary demands. Atletico has a massive amount of debt, so they have a pretty strict wage budget. Forlan and Aguero make good change, but the 3rd highest paid player is Simao, and he only makes 2.5mil, which is even less than Tiago is making at Juve.
I feel like Atletico is genuinely interested, but they’re asking Tiago to make more than a 50% wage cut, which is pretty significant. I don’t see him making it. My guess is Marotta is going to have to find another buyer.

Marotta’s and Del Neri’s biggest job is to change that, either by selling these players (very hard given their salaries) or make their careers suffer when they are here to force them out.

Add to that the fact that Amauri is terrible, and Trezeguet, Iaquinta and Del Piero all have regular injury problems, I can’t see how a team wanting to accomplish anything could go into a new season with such a forward line.
As much as I think Dzeko would be ideal, it doesn’t have to be him.

New fullbacks and wingers will solve both of these problems.
Motta has a lot of pace, energy and is pretty composed on the ball. His crossing is also pretty good. De Ceglie ditto and also has a great cross. If you do end up keeping Giovinco his crossing is exceptional, as well as his creative wingplay. Martinez also very versatile, good at picking a pass/cross. IF you sign Krasic, he is an exceptional winger who gets to the endline and puts in world class crosses.
Diego playing higher up the pitch and dragging defenders out of position will do wonders for whoever the prima punta is. Simply too static last season.",ricci ,"Jul 20, 2010 ", 9:23 PM,

second what is this weird fascination with formation names. you can call it whatever you want (442 vs 4411) but this is not theoretical problem you can solve by changing formation names. bottom line with diego in the line up you will have one striker (crappy striker too) on the pitch to be your one goal scoring threat. so who is going to be your other threat to actually finish ??
in 442 the SS role is even more important than no 9. he has to be main threat down the middle in terms of creating chances and being able to score. dont see diego doing well in both these area. ok i will be generous and say he will do well in creating chances for the no 9 up front but he just cant score and finish so for that reason this experiment will flop big time
have doubts that 442 can even succeed at the very top level with the quality of players juve have but at the minimum you need a really good SS as your central MF in 442 is essentially defensive and offer zero creativity (marchisio , melo/sissoko or emerson , viera). all teams that had success with this formation had a world class SS (ADP for juve , cassano for samp , owen for england etc etc)
do you see diego being a player like ADP or cassano or owen or baggio ?? all of them were top class finishers with intelligent movement off the ball to create chances and open up defenses and score ton of goals. just cannot see diego being anywhere close to what del neri needs for his 442 or 4411 or whatever you want to call it

If Giovinco decides to leave then Krasic would be a good solution. If he decides to stay then the Juve have enough wingers.

All you have to do is compare Totti’s scoring record at Roma to his record with the Azzuri. Totti’s scoring record with Roma is excellent. With the Azzurri he has 9 goals in 58 appearances. This is because he plays as a trequartista with the Azzurri and primarily sets up goals rather than scores them.
I too was initially worried about Diego’s goalscoring ability…which is why I think Del Piero will still play a very important role this year as he offers a guarantee when it comes to scoring goals.

So you’re saying we need a creator and a goal-scorer. Some of them seem kinda random, Kaka sucked at Real this year, Villa hasn’t played for Barca yet, and Vucinic/Totti, well, Totti scores a lot, but Vucinic is pretty inconsistent. He had a good season this year, but other than that 11 was his peak.
So what do Juve have? Well, if Diego/Trez are first choice, then we expect 15 goals from Trez, and 10 from Diego. Both doable. Then we need about 10 goals from our subs/reserves…ADP/Iaquinta can do that, as long as they’re healthy, which is the big variable. Fact is, even with Amauri playing most games, we scored 55 goals last season which is not Scudetto-worthy, but decent enough. More than Sampdoria or Napoli, who finished ahead of us. This year, like last year, was all about defense.
Is our attack good enough to win the Scudetto? No. Is it good enough to finish in the CL spot, though, and that’s our aim. Next year is when we need to sign a bomber.",agiamba ,"Jul 19, 2010 ", 6:32 PM,

For those who aren’t very good with Italian, it’s a fan-made parody of a meeting between Berlusconi and Galliani and pokes fun at the horrible mercato policy Milan has followed the last few years.
Some gems:
“I have already talked to Galli and Tassotti for the coaching job and they have accepted to play the Xmas tree formation with the corpses of Gattuso, Ambrosini, Pirlo, Ronaldinho and Seedorf next year.”
“They are also happy with the prospect of selling Pato for 60 million and signing Billy Costacurta on a free!”
“In order to calm down the fans’ uproar from Pato’s sale, let’s try to get a rumor going that Pato frequents prostitutes, has affairs with transsexuals, does drugs and is an alcoholic.”",Jorid ,"Jul 19, 2010 ", 8:00 PM,

besides as we saw in south africa teams with static forwards get no joy, u need mobile forwards like villa, mueller & forlan to complement targetmen … u need them to do the running around, harrying and dragging opposition defenders out of position, u need them to be able to pose a threat outside the 18-yard box, u need them to make the opposition midfield drop deep in order to pick them up and allow ur midfielders advance
big strong target men with no capacity to add value outside the 18-yard box are like clay pigeons … all defenders need to do is mark them stoutly and when delivery is of the quality we’ve seen from de ceglie, molinaro, zebina, grosso n co ; then the job is made even easier… add to that forwards like amauri & iaquinta who have close-to-zero skill/technique and opposition defenders can go bungee-jumping…
my point?

One Static Striker Is Often Enough,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 19, 2010, 1:47pm PDT",,"Guys,Guys….
WE all very well know that in last 2-3 years our buys were dreadful. I’m not gonna mention the names which all know cause it’s borring already.
Think a bit, we are out of CL, 30mln budget, no good transfers out to collect ammounts and guess what???
WE ARE IN THIS STALEMAT SITUATION!
1. WE NEED TIME TO REINFORCE EVERYTHING – for a year it’s not gonna happen. Let’s wait 2-3 years and then we can make conclusion, but only if we keep in long therm coach and technical staff.We must stop aiming high, we need just 4th place for CL.That’s it.
2. OUR ATTACK NEEDS NEW BOOD – t-rez is the best solution from all this forwards we have in hand. His staying can be very important to develope the project which begin right now. yes, we need new striker for sure but think a bit, no CL , better to invest in some emergency areas in defence & midfield.With this attackers we can reach the 4th place.let’s finish this year to have money to buy a bomber not average like Amauri.
3. DEFENCE – this must be our main objective.with Bonnuci coming and i hope Chiello stay we can dream for serious couple and backbone in the future 5-6 years. i read a lot of their similarity but that’s bullshit.HERE IS THE GDN ROLE-to sort the things right! The problem remains in fullback positions Marko Motta is gonna prove me right -the guy is good, but we need one more good RB to have,forget about JZ and ZG.On the left we are fucked up! PDC is not solution he can have 3-4 good games per season but it’s not solution at all even for CL spot.Grosso is way to far from good so here is the point WE NEED to Invest for starter here!Baqk ups we have for CB – watch the friendlies.
4.Melo/Momo/Poulsen – one of this must be sold for sure.I prefer one of the MELO/MOMO personally.Here is another main issue – DEEP LAYING PLAYMAKER!we have too many of this carpenters mainly MOMO and MELO, that’s why we need to invest seriously here or at least to try somebody from primavera here (Marrone for example). Once we resolve this serious issue we can have extra creativity in midfield.
5. GIOVINCO – the guy must leave! we all love the kid but honestly i can’t see him as a starter soon in this team. Better to leave him go!He has enigma in him but neet somebody like WENGER to show him the way.don’t bother you – even to keep him he will digg on the same place like till now.
6. Wings – it seems that they are very important part of the project and guess what – i’m agree! what happened when we played without NEdved and Camo for a long time…we know.So, wings will be useful for all the trasformation in the future in 4231 or 4213 even. GDN is not gonna play only in 442 believe me.the question is – are they good enough? For this goal may be but not for champions league team. Martinez is average for me even in Catania. I hope he can improve. Pepe is good player but not star one who can make differene- i hope he can prove me wrong! Lanzza is the only one who i think can grow a lot and transform in serious player, but he needs to be guided a lot.in first 2 games he didn’t impress me but later he improve a bit. He needs time.pasqatto is other good thing – the guy looks very freshy and can be sensation for Juve.I hope GDN to remain him in first team.

One Static Striker Is Often Enough,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 19, 2010, 1:47pm PDT",,"One of the problems i realized is that we are not playing a true 4-4-2 if melo/momo is in the team. It will be more like 4-1-3-1-1 with either of those and Diego in the team. So, if we want some one to control the tempo of the game, where are we going to play him? The solution is to teach Momo/Melo how to pass, a maybe impossible task.
i think we should stop dreaming about Dzeko and start getting in quality FBs and wingers. i dont like Drenthe – he is no better than PDC. I am not so sure about Krasic, but he appears to love the shirt and impressed a lot of people, so who knows.",Papai ,"Jul 20, 2010 ", 3:14 AM,

Yes,sometimes he does it unnecessarily when he starts losing faith in his teammates, but his heart’s in the right place. 4/4/2 is rarely as such. As far as I’ve been taught, the two up front should never be square anyway, so it’s pretty much 4/4/1/1.

for me our wingers aren’t good enough, they are competent, but not brilliant. but its ok, i can live with them for a year.

The good news is Motta has impressed a lot, PDC is improving, but Grosso has been poor. Too slow, out of position, GDN doesn’t fancy him.

I’m going to go out on a huge limb with this but I predict Diego to have a better season than Wesley Sneijder as long as they both stay healthy.
-Diego has all to prove, Sneijder is already at the top of the world.
-Diego is eager to show all of his critics and those who want him out of Torino the type of player he is and has had time to rest; Sneijder will be tired from a ridiculously long season, just got married and will have to deal with Rafa.
-All of the same “journalists” who called him a half-player and a flop, will eat their words and start calling him “the revelation of the season”.

The aim is to simply piss off those damn juve fans who criticise me and now are begining to blame you…most of my posts are deliberatly funny in favour of amauri, but they have no sense of humour!. my recent comments of amauri are on the title ""del piero v ferrara""…but if you look, there are so many more.

These guys are at best average players, although at least Lanzafame is young enough that he can still develop and improve. Gio is technically and creatively superior to all three of the new wingers who have joined this summer. It will be a very dark day when Gio leaves, one that the club will come to regret. Another issue that the Hamburg game raised is the lack of a decent ball playing midfielder in the middle of the pitch. We are crying out for a quality regista to dictate our game.

Which fans are you exactly talking about? Almost everyone here agrees on the fact that ADP simply can’t and shouldn’t start every game these days, while acknowledging that he should be kept as a “super-sub”/locker-room leader. Almost every other Juve fan I’ve talked to shares the same belief; the majority of the Italian ultras, fans who are part of “I Drughi”, those who post on VS and the same ones who watch every single game live seem to think this way also.

What selfishness? Unless ADP is a huge, locker-room c**t behind the scenes, he has never really shown to be a selfish player; on contrary, in his interview he seems to just want to be treated like everyone else and want the best for Juventus.
-Giovinco is definately an exception to this rule.
This might be true but what does ADP have to do with this? That’s simply the manager’s fault and lack of consideration for Seba. I mean, do you imagine Del Piero hating Seba’s guts and holding a shotgun to the manager’s head threatening to blow his brains off if Gio sees the pitch lol?!
-Really? when Giovinco expresses his desire to play it looks as if he’s being snubbed and shutout week in week out.
See above.
And please, don’t take this as a hostile reply. I’m just trying to comprehend why some people seem to think that ADP is the reason to all of Juve’s on-pitch problems.
Also, although I like Giovinco and am all for him starting over ADP or starting at LW, I’m sick of hearing people cry his name lol.
You’d think he was the second coming of the Messiah or Leo Messi’s twin brother.
Yes, he’s very talented but most fans’ consideration of him is unrealistic to say the least.

Ferrara’s main problem was that he didn’t seem to have the balls to bench Del Piero, the way Capello did, and then bitched about it to the press. It’s not Del Piero’s fault that he always wanted to play – every player does; it’s the coach’s job to make it clear who is in charge.
On the other hand, I think Ferrara is justified in referrring to some players (like Sissoko, I think it was) as “donkeys” who openly claimed that Zacceroni was a “tactical genius”, implying Ferrara had no idea about tactics. That was insulting and unfair to Ferrara, and the fact that even the “tactical genius” flopped so badly proved Ferrara wasn’t the only problem.
I find it baffling as a fan that the reason for our failure was pretty clear to us – a lack of creativity. The 4-3-1-2 worked best when both Camoranesi and Del Piero were on the field. The 4-2-3-1, with Giovinco, Diego and Camo, worked beautifully. Why the f*ck did we play a 4-3-1-2 with 3 non-creative midfielder and Amauri-Iaquinta upfront is beyond me, and this something both coaches did. Giovinco should have been the first-choice sub for both DP and Diego – not Candreva, not Amauri, and certainly, not De Ceglie. Do these coaches even realize how important ‘creativity’ is?

the coaches we’ve had the last season had week mentality, truth be told Del Piero deserved to start in the 07/08 and the 08/09 seasons.

Del Piero is a Juventus Legend and only Buffon, Trez and Nedved could rival him in the dressing room.

I like how Pasquatto looked at Martinez as if he was going to copy his stupid goal celebration but then thought better. Funny stuff. That kid looks promising. Motta and grosso I believe had assists and trez seems to be settling with this formation. Alessio has mentioned in the past that our problem was in defense and wrong formations. I agree with that.

I understand your rationale of Ferrara and Zac’s weak mentalities as a possible reason as to why it appears that they ignored Gio and stuck with playing an ADP friendly formation(thus leading to ADP looking like a locker-room cancer to some) but IMO it was mostly due to their lack of(recent in Zac’s case) coaching experience.

I personally think when Ferrara called players “donkeys”, I think he was refering to Felipe Melo who publically criticized him after he left and said, “Now we’re finally training properly”, and made it seem like Ciro was the one to blame for his poor form. But even under Zaccheroni, Melo still sucked big time. Hence, Ciro said the players who were poor even after he left were donkeys.
Ferrara saying Del Piero always wanting to play can be difficult is just because a) Ciro and Alex are friends, and b) Inexperience. There’s nothing wrong with Del Piero to have the desire to play.
Giovinco being benched has nothing to do with Del Piero’s attitude. That’s up to the coach to decide. If anything, Diego’s presence has a lot more to do with Giovinco on the bench than Del Piero.

I can’t believe I’m about to say this, as I’ve been a strong proponent of bringing in a new striker. On top of that, Forlan is probably my favorite non-Juve player after this World Cup. I absolutely love that man, in a completely heterosexual way of course.
I’m just not sure if Juve should be bringing in 31 year-old strikers at this point. We’re rebuilding right now. That’s why I was a supporter of Dzeko. He’s young, and not only would would be an immediate upgrade, he could hold down the CF position for 7+ years. With Forlan the worry is that by the time the rest of the squad is championship caliber, Forlan will be done or nearly done.

Depends where. I think with a 4-4-2 Gio is far better as a winger than a SS. He’s just not a natural goalscorer. He had 1 goal this season, which was just an awful, awful gift from Contini. Last year he had two, a nice free kick against Lecce and a goal against Bologna that he scuffed horribly, yet it went in. Scored an alright amount at Empoli but he’s not anywhere clinical enough to be a SS, UNLESS we have a bomber up top who can compensate. So if he’s viewed as a ADP alternative, then frankly, based on form he probably won’t beat out ADP this season. But as a winger, he can do great, and we don’t really have any world-class wingers.
I absolutely love that man, in a completely heterosexual way of course.
I agree.
I’m just not sure if Juve should be bringing in 31 year-old strikers at this point
Agreed again. I absolutely love Forlan, have particularly since I was in Madrid back in 2008ish, but he’s a bit too old, and he wouldn’t score as much in Serie A as in La Liga.
I haven’t watched Forlan play regularly since his days with Chelsea…He was quite young then…but my question is does he guarantee the same performance for club as for the country?
Ohhhhhhhh god yes. (he was at ManUtd, not Chelsea) Since transferring to Spain, he’s scored double digits every season and won the Golden Shoe twice, with Villarreal and Atletico Madrid. (I was in Madrid when he won his 2nd……32 league goals in 33 games. Scored 30 total goals this season, 35 last season…overall he’s got 86 in 153 games for Atletico, and 59 in 125 for Villarreal. Stud.
He was also absolutely killer to Atletico winning the Europa League this year- scored the tie-winning goal in the 90th minute against Galatasaray, scored a goal in both home and away in the semifinals against Liverpool, and then two goals in the final. Killer.

Giovinco playing alongside Diego can really make us a threatening team and save us money in the transfer market.

Yes, that is a coincidence. It’s a coincidence just like the fact that we never lost in 08-09 when Tiago was on the pitch. The change from 2nd to 7th had nothing to do with them, and everything to do with clean sheets against Livorno and Chievo turning into conceding 4 goals against Bayern, Fulham, or conceding 3 against Bari.

False dichotomy. I don’t start two seconda puntas up top, and I see Del Piero and Diego as rivals. Giovinco’s rivals are Pepe, De Ceglie, and Martinez. (if he can play on the left-side) He’s a left-winger to me.
As for the ADP debate, yes, Ferrara said that, but Zaccheroni denied it, so who knows what’s true. Del Piero is still a fundamental player for Juve- personally, I’d start with a 4-4-1-1 with Diego supporting Trez, but Del Piero would be an important rotation/substitute player. He cannot play twice a week 90min anymore, but he can still play amazing once a week.
I hope GDN follows through with his words ""The players in form will play"" and puts Giovinco in when he deserves.
Gio needs to get in form then…",agiamba ,"Jul 14, 2010 ", 1:34 PM,

I don’t know what to think about Del Neri’s plans for Diego. I don’t blame him for it not working out. He is quality and can provide in the right formation, but if Del Neri is set on one that Diego can’t produce in, maybe it’s best for him to go, for his own sake.

This is a 31 year old, injury prone central defender who no longer has the pace to cope with a mobile striker. Not to mention that his wages would be pretty big. Personally I’d much prefer to go for Barzagli who would be a cheaper and younger option. Also M29 I go to the Emirates every now and again and most of my friends our Arsenal fans and I think they would all disagree with you regarding Clichy. Their is no doubt that he had a poor season by his standards, but he is rated as one of the best attacking fullbacks in the world for a reason. He is a decent defender (although he can still improve) and is exceptional going forward. Personally I don’t buy the Clichy/Melo swap deal, its just tabloid gossip. Also M29 the three potential transfer targets you have mentioned would probably cost in the region of €40 million. I’m pretty sure that without some significant sales, we don’t have those sort of funds available for transfers. I think we need to get a little more realistic. Finally can someone please explain to me the reasoning behind a potential move for Krasic. We have already signed two right sided winger’s this summer, Martinez and Pepe. What would be the point of signing Krasic who is another right sided winger, It’s absolute madness. I think its absolutely ludicrous that we our even speaking about Krasic, we just don’t need him. We are more in need a of a left sided winger as it appears that Gio is unfortunately heading towards the exit.

It’s completely absurd that he wasn’t even on the bench for a damn friendly.
-Ferrara didn’t really play him,
-Zac didn’t really play him,
-GDN who fielded today even guys who are going to go out on loan/co-ownership(e.g Ekdal) and has a pretty good record with younger players didn’t even put him on for 5 minutes in a friendly match in mid-July…
The possible reasons behind all of this IMO are:
-He’s extremely lazy and has a poor attitude during training,
-He’s secretly a real, Balotelli-style, c**t with teammates and coaches etc,
-All 3 of our last coaches are senile and or find him too weak physically to even throw a couple of minutes at him,
-The club is fed up with him and his agent constantly bitching(mostly, rightfully so) and criticizing managers and their selection policies’, so they have decided to punish him for it.
Let’s just sell the guy, save ourselves the critique, save him from any further wasted time and raise some much needed funds for buying other players.

my arguement is the same for kolarov. i’m not saying we should get both because i know we can’t afford it. what i’m trying to say is that we could sign them and not have to worry about that position for 5+ years. instead, recently we had trez but we got iaquinta, and THEN amauri wouldn’t it have been easier if we just sorted it with a big signing in the first place?

He is 24, approaching the peak of his career, and has a decade ahead of him. Trezeguet will be 33 in a few months, likely past the peak of his career, with a decade of loyal service behind him. We should have cashed in last year or even the season before.
If we can get Dzeko, in any kind of deal that involves any player except Buffon, Chiellini, Marchisio, or Diego, or at any price we can afford, we should do so. You have to look at it as a future investment. In twelve months time, he will probably cost more, Trezeguet will be worth less, and we will still be in need of a world-class, complete striker, especially if Diego is going to be playing seconda punta.

Don’t get me wrong, if we could offload Amauri and Melo for 25mil together, like Jorid, I’d be all for Dzeko. But it doesn’t look likely, and we should use our remaining money to reinforce the defense first. Next year, we can overhaul the strike force.",agiamba ,"Jul 13, 2010 ", 4:30 PM,

- A backup CB
- A starting LB
- A starting CM that can pass the ball
- A left winger in case we get rid of Giovinco
- A striker
Before we buy all these players we need to get rid of some of the ones we have and the big problem Secco left us was long expensive contracts. Amauri doesn’t want to leave, Poulsen doesn’t want to either, maybe JZ will love to stay given his contract and after the WC disaster Melo is going to be hard to get rid of as well. I don’t see us getting more than 8m for Amauri, 3 or 4 for Poulsen and 0 for JZ (let him leave to wherever he would like to as long as we don’t pay for his salary). For Grosso we will get 1.5m or 2m and for Tiago 6m (maybe 8m given his WC and Europa League record).
Amauri 8m
Poulsen 4m
JZ 0m
Grosso 2m
Tiago 8m
Total 22m
Even with all that money we can’t afford Dzeko, we need to fork an extra 8-15m to get ONE player.
Someone also mentioned that Blanc said 80m will be available for next season. Maybe that is assuming 20m for CL qualifying and 25m from the supposed Buffon sale (which I am glad it didn’t happen). That is 45m we don’t have from the 80m Blanc claimed.
Obviously no one here knows how much money Marotta has available but seeing how frugal he has been negotiating for Krasic, Pepe, Motta, and Martinez I would assume he doesn’t have as much as we think he does.
So where is the money better spent we finished 6th in the scoring charts (behind Inter, Roma, Milan, Palermo, and Genoa). In the goals against category we were in 14th place (meaning only 5 teams let in more goals than we did). This comes to show that defense is certainly a weaker area than attack. Also, have in mind that we scored more goals than both Napoli and Sampdoria, two teams that finished ahead of us in the league this year.

When he had Giovinco and Camo on the wings he looked like the player we all expected when we signed him.

I have never heard of Sakho, but if he is good then by all means we should snap him. 8m for a promising defender is not bad.

Center mid: I think Sissoko and Marchisio are probably good enough for now as you say but Cigarini might be available and we need a player that can dictate the tempo of a game more than Dzeko. All I was saying is there are more places to invest than buying a striker for 30m.
And my comment about a left wing if we sell Giovinco is just because it seems likely that we will loan Giovinco. The kid wants to play and I am unsure whether GDN can offer him time.

Then we should sell Grygera, Zebina, Poulsen, Ekdal, and Grosso, and go for a leftback, preferably i think going back for Criscito would be the best idea. Then by the time of the January Transfer window, whicher striker performs worse between Iaquinta and Amauri we should get rid of, and try to go for Schweinsteiger, or at least try to go for him next season and possibly Krasic or Marin then as well, but we dont need another winger yet this season, we have enough with Camo, Brazzo, Gio, PDC, Lanza, Pepe, etc. So this season we could very easily look like this:
Buffon
Motta—Bonucci—Chiellini—Criscito
Lanza—Marchisio—Sissoko—Giovinco
-——-Muller—Diego
And then by next season we could have that very same squad, but this time with Schweinsteiger as the midfield passer in Sissoko’s place and Marchisio as the box-to-box midfielder, same way as Khedira worked with Schweini in this World Cup. And we could also have Krasic, or my personal choice, Marin, on one of the wings as well. Maybe even Ozil, though like Muller, Ozil’s price will have gone up, and he’s more of a trequartista like Diego now rather than a winger like Marin or Krasic. A Diego-Ozil swap shouldnt be out of the question either if Diego doesnt perform to the best of his ability again this season, but i think he will improve alot this season.",Armando ,"Jul 14, 2010 ", 3:22 PM,

Marin’s #3 because we could always use some wingers, as Brazzo and Camo are getting old, and De Ceglie and Pepe are unproven to be good enough for this level, so that only leaves Giovinco, Lanzafame, and Martinez. And then Ozil, since we already have Diego, though like i said before, if Diego continues to not perform to the best of his ability, then a Diego-Ozil swap deal should not be out of the question. Though i think Diego is gonna really show us what he’s capable of this season so i doubt we’ll need to get rid of him or trade him.

I do disagree with his description of Dzeko. Technically useless? Not at all. Having seen him play regularly over the past two seasons with Wolfsburg, I can safely say he is a great striker and can easily be the best striker in Serie A (well, at least along with Milito). He has pretty much all the attributes necessary; physically strong, great in the air, great movement off the ball, and great with the ball at his feet. His style is pretty similar to Van Basten’s, though far from the class of the Dutchman (in my opinion, the best striker of the last 20 years). Whether he’s worth the money being asked for his signature I don’t know (I generally don’t think any player is worth the sometimes totally ludicrous sums being slapped on them), but I do know that he’s worth our effort and we should do everything in our power to sign him (bar swapping Diego for him).",Nnahoj ,"Jul 12, 2010 ", 8:10 PM,

I personally think Dzeko is a great player but not what Juve needs right now. We still have to get a capable left back (I don’t think PDC should be a starter) and a regista. 30m will go a long way fulfilling those two positions.
Also, to those of you who were upset that Giovinco didn’t play in the last friendly. It was because he was experiencing some sort of muscle pain. He trained separately along with Martinez last Sunday.
I really hope he plays as our left mid next year. If Del Neri likes attacking wingers I can’t think of a better candidate than Giovinco. With that being said we need a very defensive left back to cover for Giovinco’s inadequacies in defense.

the solution for the LB position IMHO is this: Martin Caceres… i was surprised when he came to turin n ciro turned him to a RB when at barca he was a rather competent LB (the few times he was picked!)if barca really want to deal, perhaps we consider adding poulsen who’s already done well in spain (with sevilla) to the deal; and considering barca might want 2 have someone fill the yaya toure-shaped gap in their midfield right now, they might want 2 consider the dane…
though the uruguayan is still a bit ruff around-the-edges as a defender, his overlapping prowess is really impressive n i fink we shuld pursue the option…neither grosso nor PDC have impressed me in that position n i fink it shuld be an area of concern for marotta
as for the trez/dzeko/diego fiasco, i agree that juve need another striker, but i’m not sure if dzeko fits the bill. i don’t know too much abt him, but he strikes me as a target-man…the type who thrives on service. when teams sit back of hustle u in the middle and u can’t establish rhythm, service can be disrupted and u end up with a frustrated, isolated whinny-bitch of a striker. i woulda thot the priority would be a forward who can play ball, like we’ve seen in south africa with villa, suarez, forlan n mueller , strikers who are no-good outside the box are no-good at all… sometimes u need 2 drop deep, pick up the ball n create opportunities for yourself and ur team, and as we’ve seen over the last 2/3 yrs that is not the fore of trez/amauri/iaquinta; the only player we have who does that is del piero and seeing how age is catching up with his body and bones i woulda thot getting a similar type player woulda been a priority",ned lowe ,"Jul 13, 2010 ", 2:30 AM,

i would go for Amauri the guy isn’t young he has been playing like shit his wage is high i think a rebirth isn’t that likely i think he is passed it already and going for Dzeko is a step in the right direction

My how much time has passed...,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 11, 2010, 5:11pm PDT",,"Spanish clubs have massive debt, but it depends on which clubs we’re talking about. The big ones have a lot of debt but it’s pretty sustainable because they have such massive revenue. Take Real Madrid for instance, in merchandising and sponsorships, they’ve made almost all the Cristiano Ronaldo transfer money back. Barca has an enormous revenue as well.
The smaller sides are in serious shit, though. They have a lot of debt but little revenue- TV revenue is very very unfairly distributed in Spain (depending on how you define “fair” of course) and so most sides get little, whereas Real Madrid and Barca gobbles the money up.
The debt problem might hit RM and Barca soon enough, for those who follow current events, Spain’s banking sector is in quite a bit of a credit crunch still. Spain (and Europe) in general has significantly more expensive credit than in the US (hence why we have so much consumer debt) and it’s only increasing as international investors are taking money out of Spain, concerned about the economy. So the debt Spanish clubs (RM+Barca included) is getting a lot more expensive, and future borrowing will be too. So I think we’ll see them curb it. Good case in point- Real Mallorca has been in “financially shaky” to “destitute” in the matter of a year, hence Rafael Nadal taking ownership in the club.
Italy’s clubs have been lucky to avoid the credit crunch and thus, massive debt that is plaguing England and Spain. Serie A has stricter regulation on club finances (following the early 2000s problems) so clubs have to prove their financial viability before the season starts. Secondly, Calciopoli set Serie A back a lot and thus, the clubs have less money and less swaying power, so we weren’t making big signings or anything.
Juventus has a sterling financial balance-sheet. 08-09 we made a 5mil profit despite spending plenty on Amauri, Poulsen, etc. 09-10 we still made a profit, though revenues declined significantly in the spring, and that already counts the money they had budgeted for this mercato and the stadium.

Papai- Amauri definitely got too many calls against him last season. I did notice that plenty, he’d go up for a ball, and because of his strength, defender either wouldn’t get it, or would fall over. And the referee would blow the whistle.
Chad S- I think Amauri will stay for 2 reasons. Number one, I don’t think we’ll be signing a high profile striker. And number two, it’d be hard to find a buyer. As Jorid said, he’s not going to accept a loan. Particularly when it looks clear that Trez is leaving. (although when has it ever not?)
The other thing about Amauri I will say is he is SLOW. Always thought that while watching him, then I saw him in Toronto and TV cameras don’t do it justice, how awfully slow he is.

Trez should stay, unfortunately for us trez supporters, he is our one striker who can Actually be sold off. Amauri will flop again, I hope I m wrong.
My thoughts are:
Since we are stuck with him, we ll have to keep prince charming and we should also keep TreZ. We should sell Iaquinta, and buy a second striker.
Alex cant always start, and I have a feeling diego will flop playing as a second striker.
we should buy g rossi. He can be paired with trez or amauri, and alex can sub him..
Next season buy pazzini.

Trez should be kept, he should/deserves to end his career with us tbh, but we do need to offload people… Who knows, depends on if we buy another striker or not really, if we do, then we’ll have to sell Iaquinta/Amauri/Trez…

To be honest Ned barring the Bonucci and Motta signings I think Moggi is correct. Can you honestly say that Martinez and Pepe are better than Giovinco and Camoranesi. Also I can’t understand the fuss regarding Krasic either. We have already signed 2 right wingers this summer, why do we need to sign a third, it is just plain incompetent.

The Rebirth of Amauri?,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 7, 2010, 7:53pm PDT",,"typically most juve fans disregard the raw ability of Amauri…he did not have a great season, but tell me which juve player did?? even del piero and diego were not great, despite their big names and price tags?!?!…the main cause of problem, was the juve formation/ system, whereby they played too defensively, without any wingers to put crosses in for Amauri…Hence why Del Neri, aims to buy good crossers of the ball, but Mass totally ignores this point!!…You will truly see the best of Amauri next season…
Amauri, is the man at juve, which all fans will rely on in times of trouble, he is the messiah of juve and a gifted entertainer…The sweat that druels down his hair, is like champagne and is filtered through the bars and clubs around turin, so expensive as it melts on the tongue…His upper body is a work of art, designed to perfection and bullet proof so that he recieves such little harm, whilst he shoulder barges the opposition defense…The footballing talent that Amauri has, is second to none. His ability to dribble, shoot, run, shield, and head the ball makes him the complete striker…however typically he is not appreciated by the juve fans and has been criticised, despite making huge sacrifices for juve and italy. We should all feel guilty of Amauri’s predicament and actually start to so some compassion, with the man.

The Rebirth of Amauri?,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 7, 2010, 7:53pm PDT",,"Mass, you are right regarding transfers but we have to keep in mind the year we just had and the fact we are not playing for CL next year. No great players are going to move to a club that changed presidents, sporting directors, and coaches. On top of that, the stereotype that Juve cheated to win tittles is not very favourable in the market either and we are going get over that problem only when we win another scudetto on the field.
Getting rid of Camo will be hard but he caused many problems last season. Don’t get me wrong, he is a great player and as agiamba said I’d rather have him coming off the bench than Pepe but you have to admit he has caused us problems in the last year. Martinez I think is a different story, he is unknown, but so was Camo when we got him, we paid twice as much for Martinez than for Camo (and he is older) but the market of 2002 is different than the market of 2010. Also Martinez’s scoring record is a lot higher than Camo (yes Camo has always played as a winger while Martinez has played as a striker before) but if GDN likes his wingers with an eye for goal then I think Martinez is not a bad move, specially if he keeps his record of one goal every four matches (from his time in Catania).
On top of that we bought Bonnucci. Moggi says he might be one for the future and hopefully he is right. If we buy another player for the future (Dzeko??) then I think that would be amazing given the circumstances outlined in my first paragraph. If on top of that Motta recovers his form and we can get our youngsters playing we might not be that bad off with a PDC that knows how to defend and hopefully Seba playing down the left flank. Put all of that together and we can have a great team in 2 years time which is what Andrea and Marotta are aiming for.
Give our management time. We gave Gigli, Secco and Blanc four years (reluctantly I know), and it hasn’t even been four months since the new management took over and we are already ripping their work to pieces.

Concerning Diego, I see him playing as a seconda punta dropping off the prima punta, so essentially playing a false nine role. Such a role can be very useful if, and he probably will be, he is tightly marked by a defender. He will then drag defenders outta position to open up space behind the defense.

I can’t distinguish him from Momo in what he brings to the pitch. One or the other is valuable. Two lead footed enforcers, neither playing the back line, is an unaffordable situation for a team that aspires to the reach the pinnacle. When they play together, its painful.

Couple of you have told me (one rather angrily) that I have been deleting comments or blocking your IP address. Roberto and I have not deleted anyones comments, nor have we blocked anyone, it’s just a currently very angry spam-blocking-monster hitting a lot of stuff.
Hopefully the spam will go down soon and things will return to normal, supposedly in the next few months these pages will be moving to a Disqus (see World Cup Blog) style commenting system where you can log-in via Twitter, Facebook, OpenID, Yahoo, think a few others. Thankfully, no comments will be marked as spam then, I know some of you have had problems with the spam-monster in the past.
Unfortunately we writers don’t have any control over the spam-monster, and it’s hard to say what flags it, all I know is lots of links does. So in general-

He left fairly young (19 last year, 20 now) so he’s got time to grow. Look for him to try his hand at Serie B again.
Gaetano- As of now, it seems Marotta is focused on getting the players in, so they can be training and with Del Neri. He can sell anytime until the end of August, so his priority is to bring the ins. Expect sales to happen in early August, Del Neri is going to make his own evaluations on the players throughout the next month and tell Marotta who he likes and who is needed.
As of now, this is our squad:

GK: Buffon, Storari, Manninger….Chimenti I assume is gone as his contract expired, but no official confirmation yet.
LB: De Ceglie, Grosso
CB: Chiellini, Bonucci, Legrottaglie
RB: Motta, Salihamidizic, Grygera, Zebina
Winger: Pepe, Camo, Martinez, Lanzafame, Giovinco
CM: Marchisio, Melo, Sissoko, Poulsen, Ekdal
FW: ADP, Trez, Amauri, Iaquinta, Diego, Paolucci (I assume GDN will use Diego as a withdrawn striker and not as a regista, at least as the season starts, but who knows)
For me, optimal numbers are 4 CBs, 2 FBs per side and preferably one who can do both, 4 wingers, 4 CMs, 4 strikers, essentially double the required number. Then 2-3 utility players, so a total squad of 25 or so. So we can probably trim 2 RBs, one CM, and one striker, 4-5 players out. I’d dump Zebina, Grygera, Melo, Amauri, and Paolucci. Still would need one CB and preferably a flexible fullback. Then we could see something like this-

Storari
Motta Bonucci Chiellini ?
Camo Marchisio Poulsen Pepe
Diego
Trez
Not sure what the left-back situation is…I hope he realizes Grosso is inadequate, and PDC could take it…but he’d require confidence from the coach and personal coaching. Forward line and fullbacks haven’t been fixed all the way, but I don’t think we can do it all in one mercato. We’ve had to change the defense significantly while converting formations, so unfortunately it’d be very hard to do.
I think Marotta has done fairly well thus far, though I do wonder if the players he’s selecting are Juve quality, but ultimately I’m going to judge him to see how much deadwood he can get rid of. I kinda think we’ll see Zebina, Tiago, and Trezeguet leave…it’d be a mistake to send Trez packing with Amauri still around, but GDN worked with Amauri before and might like him.",agiamba ,"Jul 6, 2010 ", 10:26 AM,

At Samp, he put 19-year old Andrea Poli along with Palombo in CM…let’s just hope he does the same at Juve.

The EU/non-EU rule applies to registering the player, not owning the players rights. So essentially, it matters where he plays. So we could not, say, have Bari sign Krasic and then loan him to us. Nor could we buy Krasic in the same mercato from Bari, assuming we already had Dzeko.
What we can do, is get the player to spend a certain period at another club. Inter has done this a few times with Chievo and Parma. Julio Cesar is an example…he signed initially with Chievo, spent 6 months there, and then signed with Inter as a within-Italy transfer. So we could have Bari sign Krasic, and then sign him from there, assuming he’d be satisfied with spending 6 months there and such.
I don’t believe we could sign him, loan him to Bari, and cut the loan short in January, I think Bari would have to own him initially. We could, however, sign him and loan him out for the full year (using Bari’s non-EU spot) and then when he returned to Juve, he’d technically be a domestic transfer.",agiamba ,"Jul 7, 2010 ", 9:46 AM,

Oh hell yea. He is surely not worse thanGrygera & Zebina and he certainly is a wonderful lad @ behaviour on the field.
Young – well he is 24 and that honestly is not young anymore these days in football. At this age the player has to display his qualities because he isn’t going to learn anything new now – he has passed that learning curve. He can adjust and do the minor things but that’s about it and as I said the mistakes he keeps on making are stupid – Ranieri gave him many chances but his mistakes cost him his place. He didn’t learn to fix those.
I still would love to have him back in Roma but he just isn’t what Ranieri wants and if Del Neri wants him then fair enough but if Beppe is just obsessed with getting Italians who are under 25/26 then this is going to be another wasteful signing by Juventus.
Hope he works out well for you guys. It’s going to be fun to see Vucinic/Menez battling it out with Motta on that right flank.

When Germany went a goal down against Serbia (which had a more organized defense) they were never able to come back to the game. I know the germans have been clinical in taking all their chances, but the majority of their goals have come from counter-attacks when the other team was trying to come back to the game.

Rinaldo: Amazing how Forlan seems a completely different player these days compared to his old Man Utd. self.
Jose: The new rule means that each team can only purchase and ask the FIGC for playing permission for just one non-EU player. We can definitely forget one between Krasic and Dzeko, since neither Serbia or BIH are part of the EU.
Just like the previous rule, this does not include non EU players already playing in the Serie A. So for example Martinez, although he only holds Uruguayan citizenship, does not count as an “extracomunitare”.
Same thing goes for Inter’s South Americans or Milan’s Brazilian contingent.

First of all I’m not happy we are letting Immobile, Marrone and Ariaudo go. Both of them are very promising and if you ask me not any worse than any of the “regular” back-up options.
That said I’m thrilled with Bonucci. He may be more of the “butcher-type” but that’s all we need right now. A solid centre back who can hold things together at the back.
I’m keeping my hopes up that GDN would want to field a 4-2-3-1 if I’m seeing those names. Come on, admit it… It’s only a slight adaptation actually, but fits the characteristics if the players perfectly.
My main concern are of course our wingbacks, but also center midfield, where backups are far and few and upfront where a star striker is definitely still missing.

If there is any chance of Dzeko coming if Diedo is included in the deal then Juve should go for it. It really doesn’t make sense keeping a player that we aren’t gonna play.
Juve should get Zapata, he was injured last season so he shouldn’t be too expensive. He’s better that Mexes and the relationship with Udinese might make it easier (if the president isn’t in a D’ago-mood).",bulle ,"Jul 1, 2010 ", 1:55 PM,

can live with most transfers up till now, good prices for what we have, only a bit sceptic about Martinez,… I simply never heared another high rated team shown ever any interests in him
also 12 mil for an unknow internationaly unproven 27 year old? for this money there should be younger/better options !
but hey we’ll see,
THE biggest difference for me is that however maybe risking losing diego and giovinco( i’m gonna cry me a river if it happens)
unlike the previous board, they now have a clear plan and a vision, and buying to fit the vision.
while the secco en co did exactly the opposite, by just buying, building the future’s fundaments on the veterans(!) and just hope everything will come togheter by itself
altough i might not agree with every move, everyone can feel its a more competent staff now.
however i would be VERY dissapointed if diego leaves,…when you have gold in your hands , you simply don’t throw it away is what i say, unless you come with ridiculous good deal out of it( zidane for thuram, buffon and nedved for example)
dzeko will be impossible i fear.half europe is chasing his signature,whoever is going to gzt him will be able to pay a much higner price than juve can.

Mercapolypse Now: A mid-summer look at the Mercato,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 1, 2010, 8:52am PDT",,"Great post, agiamba!
One reason why I think they signed Martinez is because he actually can play as both a winger or a striker. Obviously he’s not the second coming of Del Piero lol, but maybe…just maybe Juve can offload Amauri this summer. I’m not really expecting a big name signing to come in to replace him though. That will happen next year when we’re back in the Champions League (and can hopefully get Pazzini). So if that’s the case, Juve will need back up for Iaquinta and Trez (who I think will end up staying). Then there’s also Lanzafame who can play as a winger or a striker. And we’re not sure what Del Neri has planned for Paolucci. All of those players are better options than Amauri lol.
And one thing regarding Ranocchia as well. I definitely agree that he would have been more suited for our team than Bonucci (even though I think Bonucci is a great signing). But Ranocchia would have been MUCH more difficult. I’m not sure if goal.com got this right or not, but Genoa and Inter co-own Ranocchia according to this recent article:
https://goal.com/en-us/news/86/italy/2010/06/29/2002269/bari-coach-giampiero-ventura-aims-to-keep-defender-andrea
Ventura’s says it himself that Ranocchia is co-owned by Genoa and Inter. I’m not sure when exactly this happened, but I know Inter have been interested in him for a while. I remember reading stuff from as far back as February…like this:
http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2010/02/20/1799185/inter-reach-agreement-with-genoa-over-permanent-signing-of
So maybe there has been a deal in place for Inter to sign Ranocchia for months. It would have been impossible for Juve to get him if that was the case. Genoa would have demanded a LOT I think. And I don’t even know how long he’s been co-owned by Inter either.",Anthony ,"Jul 1, 2010 ", 11:19 PM,

I like him as a right winger, but to me it seems like he loses 40% of his capacities when fielded on the left.
My thoughts on the strikers issue. I see few reasons why we should force ourselves now to buy one. I would fix the rest of the team first with 2 backs and maybe another CM, ‘cause when Marchisio is out, I don’t see anyone taking over his role, unless Tiago is coming back sigh…
So why no strikers ?
1. Financially, since a top striker costs loads of money.
2. We have some more than decent options (see below)
3. It’s a plan sprea over 2 years and we have an immense talent about to prove himself on the highest level. We should not let that go to waste (Immobile)
Trezeguet and Iaquinta are enough in this formation. They should focus on goalscoring only, since there will be a strong force behind them. And that’s what Trezeguet does best. Make him our #1 striker, hope he stays fit and use Iaquinta as the supersub he can be. If that doesn’t work we still have Amauri, Lanzafame or even Martinez.

One way or another the Juve name is not the same as it used to be and it is going to take us years to recover that, building from the bottom up.

More than Diego leaving I am upset that Giovinco didn't stay to play as a left wing, he could have really helped this team.

Also, if Traore should be a winger maybe we can ask him to play in that position. Can't be worse than when Pepe plays there.

I really hope that with the offense we have we can score some goals, they are slow and old.

Sky Sport Italia claim Martinez has been diagnosed with a suspected left knee ligament injury which could rule the hitman out for the long term.

He is expected to have further tests with the club's medical staff when an official prognosis can be given over the extent of his injury.

An official statement from the club reads: “Martinez has suffered a distortion of the left knee with a suspected injury to his internal ligament. Further tests will be carried out on Monday.”

The club also confirmed Claudio Marchisio had suffered a problem, but he will be assessed by Italy's medical staff at Coverciano.

Further announcements on the conditions of both players are expected later.

UPDATE 15:33CET

Juventus have now officially confirmed Martinez will be out for 30 days following further medical exams.

A statement released on their official website on Monday afternoon reads:

Clichy is the starter, and Kieran Gibbs is pushing him hard to take the starting role at LB.
Arsenal also has a LB on loan to FC Cartagena by the name of Pedro Botelho, who is only there because of visa issues before he can come to England. They also have a promising youngster in Tom Cruise (yes, Tom Cruise) coming through the acedamy.

Arsenal had already agreed to sell Traore to Benfica a couple weeks ago, but Traore couldn't come to terms on his wages, so the deal fell through.

What should Juve expect? A Left-back who is strong going forward, and a very good crosser of a ball. But fear his 'defending' since he has no defensive awareness whatsoever. I'm not even exagerating. His is abysmal.
If he plays left-back for you, you are in trouble. If he is played as a left-midfielder, you can expect a competent, if unspectacular, performance from him.",Darren_V ,"Aug 31, 2010 ", 6:12 PM,

Regarding Milan: Ibra is a great signing by them (I wouldn't like him back at Juve, but he is an improvement for them obviously). But Robinho? Somehow I get the feeling that it was Berlusconi's whim and that Allegri didn't asked for him. If they try to change their formation to fit Robinho they might end up having the same problems as we did last year (minus the mentality thing probably). If they bought RObinho as a substitute… well, that doesn't make much sense either. Maybe Milan bought Robinho because Ronaldinho wants to leave soon, but I don't see that as an improvement (if they are lucky, binho will be just as good as naldinho).

Pepe was bought as a substitute, a “reliable” player who runs a lot and is usually unijured. Plus he has a lower salary than Camo. Camo is definitely a good player but we can't have him as our only substitute. Last couple of seasons he has spent much of the time injured, thus means that if we were going to buy a starter right winger, and even if we'd kept Camo, we should have bought a “reliable” substitute anyway.

We bought the starter and got a loan on the “reliable” substitute. We could have kept Camo, but we would have been paying his high salary and taking the risk that whenever he is needed to play (which wouldn't be much of the time), he would be injured.

- Kjaer: Had a low buy out clause but only to foreign countries. We couldn't have signed him for the money that Wolfburg paid for him. And we had a choice to make: Bonucci or Kjaer (who would have probably been more expensive), we went for the italian which I think is a good signing.

- Kolarov: Man city paid almost 20 mil euros for him. Out of our budget.

- Elia: Hamburg wanted something in the region of 18 mil, maybe more. I know people will say “but we paid 12 mil for Martinez”, but Elia is still too young and has only one year playing at bundesliga. Martinez IMO is less of a gamble (we expect less from him, but at least he knows serie A). Besides those extra 6 mil got us a couple of players on loan (like Aquilani).

- Caceres: I really don't know what happened here, but I have two theories. Barza simply didn't wanted to sell it to us or renew the loan (since sevilla is giving them less money than we probably would have), or Juve didn't think he was good enough. Maybe that injury he had earlier this year has something to do with this. But I agree he would have been a solid signing.

Marotta built the team the right way you build any team. First CB, than FB, than CM, than wingers, .. but sort of stoped at that, because fowards are the most expensive players on the market. The midfield is good, explosive with Krasic and Lanzafame. Aquilani can provide assistance to attacking by holding the ball and providing his beautiful crosses. De Ceglie I feel will have a break through season, possibly a few call ups as well. Having said all this, the fowards wont shine. I would of been happier if we sold Iaquinta and Amauri and kept TREZEGUET and DEL PIERO. Bring in Rossi (i mean if Diego never went, he wouldnt of been needed), used Libertozzi or Immobile, and one of Pazzini and Dzeko, perferably the latter. Since our fowards arent up to snuff, Juve might struggle to make it to CL, but a winter signing of Pazzini I think will do us the world of good. As it stands tho, we dont have a good foward (del piero position) and striker.",Giorgio Romizi ,"Aug 31, 2010 ", 8:24 PM,

Officially Official: Camoranesi and Z3BINA have left the building,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 31, 2010, 8:23am PDT",,"This transfer market started out great, but ended like shit. Unless of course, Quagliarella pulls something out of his ass and scores 20+ goals this season for the first time in his career. Krasic, Martinez, Aquilani, Bonucci, Motta, and yea, Quagliarella, all these guys are good signings, but selling Diego, Camoranesi, and Trezeguet, while not being able to get rid of Grygera and Grosso, is ridiculous, though we did thankfully get rid of Zebina, Poulsen, and Molinaro. And we really, REALLY need either a versatile striker or center forward, personally i like the idea of Giuseppe Rossi. But the market is pretty much ended so there's no hope of that. To work the best with what we have, i think we need to play like this;

—————-Manninger
Motta—Bonucci—-Chiellini—De Ceglie
Krasic—Marchisio—Momo—Lanzafame
———Quagliarella—Iaquinta

I've heard that Iaquinta is coming back from injury, and he's worked with Quags before at Udinese, so maybe that's a good idea (plus theyre both versatile strikers which would work well in my opinion), at least until Amauri or especially Martinez get back from their own injuries. If De Ceglie doesnt improve, i think we should try out Traore as a starter as it may be a good idea. Melo and Momo are also gonna be fighting for that starting spot, but if Momo doesnt have any more personal problems like he had last season and can find the form he had in 08-09, then i think he'll start more often than not. And Aquilani's gonna be fighting for any and all positions in midfield, whichever he can get, as he can play as a center midfielder or a winger. So Lanza, Aqua, and Marchisio are gonna be fighting for 2 of those 3 spots in the midfield in my opinion, though i think it should go to Marchisio definitely in the center and the wing? Probably Lanza as he's faster and probably a better dribbler, though Aqua's long range shot would come in handy.

i thought we weren't going for him was because he would be tussled over by madrid, barca etc. but i heard nothing about him all summer….

and i know he was out of our budget, but if you take away martinez's 12m, and maybe sold tiago (instead of loaned) for 7ish mil and (accepted a loss on him). also, considering the pitiful deals we got on diego and poulsen where we probably should've got at least 2mil more on each, it may have been possible.

Officially Official: Camoranesi and Z3BINA have left the building,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 31, 2010, 8:23am PDT",,"Vargas would be great for the left wing. Krasic and Vargas would be a similar combination to Robben and Ribery. Granted, Bayern's duo obviously have more talent, but style wise it would be very similar, aka VERY DANGEROUS. I would love to get Vargas for the left wing, if so, i think we would be set. Unless of course Lanzafame develops to be that good, and then we'd be fine. One thing is for sure, while Milan might have bought bigger names, with Robinho and Ibrahimovic, i think Juve have a much brighter future. When Giovinco, Pasquato, and Ariaudo come back, we also have Libertazzi, Buchel, F. Rossi, Marrone, Giandonato, Boniperti, and Immobile. Not to mention we already have Lanzafame, Motta, De Ceglie, Bonucci, and Marchisio who are all relatively young and have their best years ahead of them. Krasic, Chiellini, and Aquilani are also not old either. Plus, we have made some very solid signings. If Martinez can hit his Catania form, Krasic his CSKA form, Quags his Udinese form, Amauri his Palermo form, Melo his Fiorentina form, and Aquilani his Roma form, we can win the Scudetto for sure in my opinion (though i dont think Aqua should be starting). That may sound like i'm asking alot, but really it's not. Fiorentina, Palermo, Roma, and Catania are all Serie A teams so those guys are already used to Serie A. And CSKA is in the Russian League, but one of the Top teams over there, and he was their star player, he just needs to become one of our stars now.

4. Bonucci – A (we need a young and high quality CB, and he seems to be one)
5. Martinez – C (when healthy, a good winger and ss, but too expensive)
6. Motta – B (good at moving forward, must improve but ok at defending)

There are a few wrinkles that are puzzling (Diego? WTF?!) Given that Juve was a mid-level team last year, had a TON of deadweight (Zebina, I'm looking at you), and no CL football to offer, I think Beppe did an admirable job getting Bonucci, Krasic, Quags, and Aquilani to come in. While they are not sexy names and aren't going to sell newspapers, we can hope that they fight for the name on the front of the jersey. While Bari was a messy speed bump, it is just one fixture in a tough spot to play. The objective is the CL this year, scudetto next.

Officially Official: Camoranesi and Z3BINA have left the building,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 31, 2010, 8:23am PDT",,"Hmmm…. how about this:

Defense
Incoming: Storari (GK), Bonucci (CB), Rinaudo (CB), Motta (RB), Traore (LB).
Outgoing: Canna (CB), Caceres (RB), Zebina (RB), Molinaro (LB).
Analysis: Beppe did good and massively shore-up the defense. Storari is a bit pricey but Bonucci and Motta are major upgrades on the starting defense. A bit disappointment on the backups, though. But all in all, great job!
Grade: A-.

Midfield
Incoming: Krasic (W), Martinez (W), Pepe (W), Lanza (W), Aquilani (AM).
Outgoing: Poulsen (DM), Tiago (CM), Camo (W), Diego (AM), Gio (AM).
Analysis: Major change. Out goes the AMs and in comes the wingers. Krasic and Martinez should be good; Aqua, if healthy, can prove to be a steal. Pepe is not a juve material, though. Too bad couldn't sell Tiago permanently. The biggest question: can the wingers replace the trequaristas as the playmakers?
Grade: C.

Attack
Incoming: Quags.
Outgoing: Trez.
Analysis: An inconsistent (albeit sometimes spectacular) striker for a legend. Failed to have Borriello on loan. With Amauri and Iaquinta out for at least one month, only ADP and Quags are available for GDN. Yikes!
Grade: F

Spending
Revenue: 56mil.
Expenditure: 33mil.
Total: 23mil.
Analysis: Lost 10mil from the diego sales. Paid too much on Martinez. Also paid too much on Pepe and Quag's loans. On the other hand, we essentially only purchased Storari, Bonucci, Martinez and Krasic. All solid buys. Of the loans, Motta and Aqua (if proven healthy) can have major impacts.
Grade: B-.

Overall Grade: C+.",dwicarta ,"Sep 1, 2010 ", 2:05 PM,
Officially Official: Camoranesi and Z3BINA have left the building,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 31, 2010, 8:23am PDT",,"That is what I have been saying all along.

- Storari was a must buy, given that Buffon was going to be injured for 4 months and who knows how long it will take him to get back in form.

- Bonucci was a good buy, probably the best thing in the market for that price (remember Rannochia was coming from an injury).

- Martinez, yes he was 12m but his salary is very low, all in all we won't pay too much for him and he can fill many roles, I am not as disappointed with that purchase as most of you.

- Last is Krasic, he is not the next Nedved, but he is dedicated to this team. I think he will become a substitute to a great wingers in two or three seasons and that is not a bad idea.

The other guys are on loan, so they know they enjoy the confidence of the coach for a year, but they also know they must perform, I don't think that is a bad deal

The players on loan also have a year to prove themselves but under a lot less stress than in the Juve shirt. If Gio has a great tournament I think we will recall him if he fits the coach's idea. Ekdal resembles Marchisio lots, if Marchisio doesn't up his game or if Aquilani doesn't work out for us, then Ekdal will be brought back as well. Same goes for Immobile. The co-ownership deals are important because the other teams have a vested interest in developing our players, if our players grow we will pay more money, if they don't then we won't. Win-win.

We need to give our players time to gel, and our management to do their work. From September 1st until Dec 31st, they will work to find us a couple more things in the winter market that might help us reach that 4th place objective.

Lastly, remember we never got a sponsor for the away kit, I am sure that hurt our market as well.

I am not going to say that Marotta is the greatest transfer guru in the history of the game, but at least we came up with a plan that will get us that 4th spot. The plan is not flawless, as we saw in Bari last weekend) and it might fail, but it is better than spending 50m in two players who don't really compliment each other and then get an aging Cannavaro past his prime and a Fabio Grosso who only had one good World Cup to show for.",Jose ,"Sep 1, 2010 ", 2:10 PM,

about all those loan deals,…

I'm personally not a fan of loaning at all ( loaning out = great, but loaning in,…meh)
as it is too uncertain for your future no matter what scenario,…

if the loan flops, you don't want te have him, if the loan truly excells, 90% he simply will return only not if there are already too many players at the position (caseres) and even in that case, the owning club can still sell him to another club,….

loaning imo is only good as a last resort like for replacing a severe injuried keyplayer at the end of a transferperiod or something

having for 55mil of potential buys on loan service is silly and absolutely not smart long term investment

Lastly, I rather not buy him permanently b/c well, we simply need a younger striker that we can build on for the future (Pazzini/Dzeko)

I have been saying for a long time that I felt Marotta and Del Neri are turning Juve into a midtable team. Some of their signings left me scratching my head asking what do they see in that player (Pepe, Martinez) and 2 of the players that could have really put Juve into the scudetto hunt playing together (Giovinco e Diego) was loan out and sold respectively.

Marotta have manage to daggle hope into our eyes signing Krasic then snatching it right away in a blink of an eye by selling Diego days after. He seems to think because Juve had a poor season last year it OK to try and improve the team just a little but he's sadly mistaken if that's what he thinks. Somebody need to slap some sense into him so he can realize he's not at Samp anymore this is Juventus.

I'm bitter right now knowing that both Milano teams are now considerably stronger than us. Milan have manage to swoop 2 world class magicians at the top of their game (Ibra & Robinho) within days puting them now as the front runner for the scudetto and I hope they win just so inter don't win, because I know Juve can't win it with our current team.

Juve at this time need to make sure we secure 3rd spot because their is no guarantee that Serie A will have the 4th CL after this season. I am gutted at the way Marotta and Del Neri manage to destroy our slim title hopes this season. Giovinco, Diego and Krasic together could have been the foundation to something special this season. You can't win the Italian league without a strong defense and a creative player or 2 who can change the game with a moment of genius, so far we have neither. Don't say Alex because he's not 28-30 years anymore and he always had a few genius in the MF or FW alongside him (Baggio, Vialli, Di Livio, Conte, Zidane, Nedved, Davids, Camo and Ibra).

With Motta, Lanza and Aquilani, we only dish out between 0-1M for each player to have this option. I believe most of us don't have any problems with these.

With Pepe and Quags, we are a bit tied. On these loans, we've shelled 2.6M and 4.5M respectively. We'll loose the money if we don't purchase them next year. But still, spending 7M now instead of 25M+ is a great option to me especially we're hearing that Pazzo MIGHT come.

Don't worry about creating the opportunities. GDN will have his playmakers/passers from the wings (and the middle when Aqua plays) instead from the hole/diego last season. With ADP as ss, he'll also pass. With Quags, probably not so much.

What worries me is how we put the ball in the net. Amauri? bleh… Iaquinta?… hurt all the time… Borriello? He's not enthusiastic to come, so why bother… Quags? Inconsistent…

To me it seems as if Marotta understands that us supporters want results and want them quickly, so he's loaning most the players to try and achieve those short term results without outlaying huge amounts of money, if all goes to plan we'll be back in UCL next year (Or else we're in serious shit) and get a decent injection of funds aswell as prestige back to the club, not to mention moving to our new stadium where we'll receive more of the revenue, and then from this we can slowly slowly start to buy these world class players we've become accustomed to.

Unfortunately, calciopoli messed us up real good, as did Secco's reign, and now he's trying to restore us to where we should be, whilst also getting the results to keep the supporters happy.

Perhaps i'm being too optimistic, but i really do think Marotta is looking at the bigger picture. As supporters we should trust him for now, and also look at the bigger picture, because as they say Rome (Torino) wasn't built in a day.",Pasq92 ,"Aug 31, 2010 ", 6:43 AM,

Glad to see the back of Zebina, but disappointed to see Camoranesi go. I would have preferred him to see out his final year at Juve and leave next summer. Camoranesi is a far better player than both Martinez and Pepe.

Regarding Traore, he is a good prospect. I've seen him play for both Arsenal and Portsmouth. He has a very good offensive game but defensively he still needs work. I think he would be a decent signing, but he would need time and games to adapt to Serie A. I would say he is a slight improvement on De Ceglie and he is only 20.

I'm worried, Inter have a very strong squad already and Milan have seemingly signed two world class players in Ibra and Robinho. We are way behind both teams. Marotta has made some really silly mistakes in this transfer campaign. And now with rumours of Borriello's potential transfer, it appears as if he will make another one. Borriello is NOT an improvement on what we already have. If Marotta cannot sign a striker that improves our offensive line, then I'd prefer him to concentrate on signing a defender as we are in massive need of some defensive cover.

I'll be honest I'm expecting another long and disappointing season. I think Del Neri was a mistake. We needed to go for a young offensive minded tactician, namely Deschamps. I think releasing the likes of Edkal, Giovinco and Diego were mammoth mistakes, that will come back to haunt us. I find it funny that people think Giovinco will come back next season! The way we have treated him over the last 2 years, why would he want to return.

Marchisio is a decent midfielder but he hasn't played well for months. At the moment he doesn't deserve to have a starting place within the team. He should be benched in favour of Aquilani. He really needs to pick his performances up and quickly.

I hope for a champions league place but I think that we will endure another disappointing campaign. In fact I don't expect Del Neri to see out the season.

2. fact #1 DRASTICALLY reduces our chances of landing the likes of zlatan, robinho, benzema, ozil or any of the other marquee signings that would have us rubbing our palms in glee (our cause is definitely not helped by the sporting and administrative mess we have been over the last 2-3 years ; yes our books are balanced and our finances are healthy , but this is NOT the Corporate Social Responsibility League ; it's professional football where players crave the big-match nights, fat salaries and title-winning glory and so they'd rather be at a financially-precarious man city, real madrid, barcelona or ac milan than a 'legendary' juventus)

And I see what you say about Napoli or Genoa but 18m for Cavani I think it is an exaggeration, the guy is not that good… better than Amauri, of course, but considering Milan will pay 24m for Zlatan in one year then Cavani is at least 4 or 5m too expensive. We haven't seen Rafinha play for an Italian side but after our experience with Amauri, Melo and to a lesser extent Diego, it is safe to say that we should be careful when signing Brazilians.

We thought that we were going to challenge for the scudetto after our worst season EVER, just because we have tons of money (which we don't have) to sign all the players in the world. But that's simply not true.

I agree that selling Diego and loaning Giovinco doesn't look very ambitious (and if I had Marotta's job I wouldn't have done that, but for obvious reasons I don't have Marota's job). But we have to respect the work of these people (Delneri, Marotta and Agnelli). We can't condemn them after our first Serie A game. It's a completely new team, it will need time.

We might not like their plan, but it makes sense. Right now we don't have the money nor the CL to get the best players in the world. So we have two choices:

1) Do what Secco did, spend lots of money (whic, again, we don't have) on signing players that are not good enough, pay them huge salaries to convince them to come (since we don't have CL nor real scudetto ambitions) and then suffer to get rid of them… and not wining anything in the meantime.

2) Get rid of some players with high salaries, get one year loans on some players who will only help us to accomplish our true objective of this year (get into CL), and then get rid of them for free. If this works next year we will have more money and we will be more attractive to sign the right players.

Again, you might not like option 2, but the guys who are leading the team does like it, and they at least deserve a change to prove us wrong.

Storari is proving to be a solid keeper, but he's not as vocal and commanding as Buffon. Is it just me not hearing him? He should be helping Chiellini organize the defense and helping them keep them defensive shape.

We gave away the ball too easily for large parts of the game, and I think THAT'S the real problem, not losing the game. Because if we play this game 10 times, two of those 10 Donati will probably injure a couple of tifosi with that shot, 3 or 4 times he will ruin some photographers faces, will probably miss the ball 3 more times and will score that stunner once.

- Melo did well but I will not get my hopes up with him yet he started well last year then did a 180.

- De Ceglie is not good enough to be starter for a mid table team so why is he a starter at Juventus? or have we now become a mid table team?

- Del Piero is not a starter in this stage of his career, I have stated why on many occasion so that is that.

- Krasic and the Bonucci-Cheillini partnership should get better.

there is no point in saying who “should” still be here and this and that, it is what it is, and we have to accept it ( Diego scores on debut for Wolfsburg/Giovinco played beautifully for Parma…really makes me want to think what we are doing!?!?!)

Juve is bigger than any one individual, it is a team, and has always been a team, I remember when people were moaning about Zidane being sold and this and that…but what did we do with the money?

I really don't care that we conceded a magnificent and truly unstoppable goal, but the difference is we didn't create many chances. I saw movement in the centre with melo bombing forward (no marchisio though) but out on the wings krasic was subdued…didn't push forward. I really don't have high opinions of the rest of the wingers really. To me giovinco would have opened up this game pretty easily though we would have needed a rock solid defender like criscito behind him who held his position and maybe a DM moving left to support him, but all in all that extra pace and creativity down the other wing would have been perfect, with aquilani in the centre providing the distribution. Marotta's subs were reminiscent of Ranieri's where he takes off the better player to replace him with a mediocre one. Honestly, I still don't get why people are so kicked about sissoko. If I had my way, he'd have been out of this team a long time ago. He just doesn't have any footballing acumen and is a danger on his worse nights to his own team. This left back issue has been a problem since serie b days and honestly I would have thought keeping the ONLY proper italian LB in the game at the moment would have made a lot more sense than shelling out what we did for Bonucci. Don't get me wrong, I think that bonucci is an awesome player but we could have bought a decent central defender for the price we did pay for him ( and we did pay heavy losing one of our own). Finally, I actually feel sorry for Del Neri, if indeed he did want to keep diego and trez. I couldn't have figured out a better team than he did with what he had at his disposal. Martinez maybe could have started, but that's it.

We're still not playing together as a team. Gelling takes time yes, but this is my biggest concern at the moment. And it has sub-problems for each part of the tactical set-up:
• The DEFENSE, contrary to what aagiamba says, is still shaky at best, particularly the wings. It is astonishing how many times Bari was able to penetrate on the flanks today, with their wingers completely unmarked and receiving well-timed penetrating passes. Under that light Motta/De Ceglie were completely inappropriate, with Bonucci not helping much either and Chiellini left pretty much to himself, forced to patch up the leaks of his teammates.
• The MIDFIELD, is a question mark. The center mids (Marchisio above all, lost at sea) are unable to feed through balls on to the wings, while the wingers are not only having trouble finding space, but their crosses (Pepe in primis) are currently way off target. A few missed passes is fine, but so many unacceptable.
• The FORWARDS: ADP-Quagliarella = ghost dogs today. The teamwork will take time to develop between these two, but boy were either of them mediocre. I can't remember them making any shots on target.

I am also somewhat displeased with Del Neri. He made some tactical choices that in hindsight, were obviously wrong.
• Starting Krasic (although I probably would have done the same, sharing the same optimism)
• Starting Quagliarella (I would have preferred an ADP-Martinez partnership, especially since Quags is generally much more productive coming off the bench).
• Subbing Felipe Melo (for ONCE that he was playing well… he subs him off instead of Marchisio? Madness).
• Running out of subs so early in the match (although to be honest, a manager like Mourinho would have subbed both Pepe and Krasic straight at half time, just to prove a point how bad they were playing). We had Martinez on the field at 50% capacity for over half an hour.

And speaking of Melo, despite being one of the best players on the field today, he was still indirectly responsible for our loss… he just can't help himself! Confused? He's the one that knocked Gazzi out of the game, forcing Ventura to sub him off for Massimo Donati.

Now knowing Del Neri, I think his biggest training exercises this week will focus on improving this defense of ours, making it iron-tight to effectively use our counter-attacks through Pepe/Krasic/Lanzafame etc. That said, I don't see this happening with the current players. We crucially need a good wing-back before the transfer window closes.",Marco P. ,"Aug 30, 2010 ", 1:44 AM,

At approx. the 75th minute, the match commentator on RAI remarked that Juventus was completely extinguished and had no ambition to score. I don't see how they 'didn't' give up. Perhaps certain components didn't give up – but for the most part we were pretty much tired following half time.

Positives:
Defence

Negatives:
Offence
Midfield

I'm all for going forward with deceglie and motta. they had some bright spots and some bad spots. Throwing them to the wolves and leaving marchisio to continue his lack lustre ways or sissoko losing the ball every single time he touches it would simply be an injustice.

With that being said, another team I am fond of in another sport recently went through a restructuring phase. They got rid of half their team and brought on new hands. At first it took time to mesh, but as the season went on they become more prolific, and actually ended the season on a high. I'm not saying this could happen with Juventus, but, there's a chance.

What I am stuck on is how they can justify the removal of certain players and the additions of certain very ordinary people. Good on Pepe for being transferred to Juventus and going to south africa for the world cup and featuring in all 3 of our games – especially considering he has 0 talent and skill. But, fuck, time and time again this guy shows he has no direction, why is he even here? I mean, how does this guy slide through the system.

Bringing Borriello here would be good, but at the same time an unnecessary waste of money. We have injuries, but at the same time, we have too many players of his caliber and positioning. We need to sit back and deal with what we have, whether Marrotta made mistakes this season won't be known until Christmas. So let's sit back and watch, hopefully not all our games will be this shit.

But, based on our performance, I can honestly say, for a team with such history and so much to prove this year, there was nothing in terms of passion. We didn't even try to grind out a result, we didn't even try to rush the box and get an ugly one for the team. We sat back and on the day looked like the poorest (although Brescia is making a case too) team in Serie A.",Marco ,"Aug 30, 2010 ", 2:26 AM,

Calm down would ya'!

Juve fans need to ease up, is not the end of the world (yet).

Lost the first game of the season, granted, not the ideal start.

However, played away to a Bari side who are quite decent, and are already very familiar with one another and the way they play.

We had something like 6 new starting players, Quags had barely trained with the side, same with Krasic, thrown straight into the deep end, have barely even started bonding with one another. We also were playing with a man down for a decent portion of the second half after using all 3 subs (Coaching error), so DP who can't play a full game these days had to persist for the whole 90 with a partner who was brand new to the team with Amauri and Iaquinta (both who know the team) out injured.

Also, on the coaching error thing, i do think GDN fucked up, Melo was doing well, probably our best player and then he subbed him for Sissoko, who in essence does exactly the same thing! Although we would have lacked creativity it would have given us more control of the midfield and try to get our wingers into the game if he had replaced Marchisio instead IMO.

One of the positives was Krasic's amazing pace! Looking forward to seeing him play when he's match fit and has moulded into the team.

All in all, shit display, but we all knew it would take time.

Season Starts at a Crawl,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 29, 2010, 4:00pm PDT",,"According to Football-Italia, Juve is looking for a LB and Prima Punta.

Apparently, we have these options for LB:
1. Wayne Bridge (30), Manchester City, on loan or in exchange for Camoranesi (33).
2. Joan Capdevila (32), Villarreal.
3. Royston Drenthe (23), Real Madrid.
4. Armand Traore (20), Arsenal.
5. Reto Ziegler (24), Sampdoria.

For Prima Punta:
1. Karim Benzema (22), Real Madrid. Mou hates him, character issue.
2. Marco Boriello (28), AC Milan. He'll loose his place to Ibra.
3. Diego Forlan (31), Atl. Madrid. He's a second striker.
4. Pazzo (26), Sampdoria. Samp is playing hard ball.

Krasic, Quags, and Martinez (when healthy) will come good. Lanza will be a good subs, Bonucci will settle, and the jury's still out on GDN.

SO, if juventus were to play in the EPL this squad would THEORETICALLY, once again, theoretically, be good. the 'only' problem is that creative players can often thrive in serie a so milan is definitely going to be a team to watch out for.

Why? : Considering our current set-up and the slowly-dawning reality that our open-play/midfield creative abilities are still well under-par, we need a striker who is useful OUTSIDE the box and can play on his own . We need someone who's usefulness is not limited by the presence/absence of a seconda punta. Options 2 & 4 don't fall into that bracket. Option 3 does , BUT he's 74 yrs old, n i'll be damned if our idea of re-building the forward line is to buy ANOTHER 30-something year old forward. Karim has pace, great technique (can take on and beat defenders) he's good in the air and has an awesome shot. Yes he romps with under-aged prostitutes too , but that's bcuz he was largely idle for both club and country , a move to turin will keep him FULLY occupied

LB : Ziegler/Traore

Options 1 & 2 are disqualified by the same reasons I am not keen on forlan. Y swap a 65 yr old Grosso for a 64 yr old Capdevilla/Bridge ? Drenthe is an all action player and he'd do if we were really keen on the juventus legends reloaded theme (we got krasic to play nedved, so hand royston some goggles n let him play edgar davids!) but i think that while he's definitley more technically-gifted than PDC , he's ALSO more wingback than fullback ,.

So that leaves us with Ziegler and Traore. Ziegler knows delneri from their time together at 'Doria and that's a plus, but Traore is from that duracell-run windmill that never stops churning out quality french fullbacks… If Wenger would deal, I'd say Armand",Denny ,"Aug 30, 2010 ", 2:42 PM,

The spine is the main problem. Look at the example from Real Madrid…each year they go and buy a lot of players and they haven't been able to go beyond round of 16 in the CL with all that money spent.

You mentioned Milan? If I were a Rossonero fan, I wouldn't get too excited. Yes their first win was convincing, yes Ronnie-Zlatan-Pato looks good (if they get Robinho even better), but their squad depth and their coach is still raising serious questions. And like others pointed out, their opponents Lecce are nowhere near the level of Bari, which was probably the worst choice (not that we had any) we could make for a team to play on matchday 1.

As far as spines go, our post-calciopoli backbone was inherently flawed in that we put the wrong upper management in charge. You'll pardon me for continuing your anatomical metaphor, but it's as if we put all the right bones and spinal discs in place, but then failed to provide them with the appropriate connective tissue and nervous system. No wonder it crumbled and lead us straight into the wall.

Our new spine, the one which was laid in this Summer, is hopefully gonna be lasting much longer because at its base, the nervous system is functioning: Agnelli & Marotta are the right people for the job, because contrary to Blanc & Secco they understand what their job requires. All that's left is finding the right bones & spinal discs, and even though some of the current ones may be cancerous (I'm thinking players who just don't cut it at Juve), they can be replaced.

Aren't we a little too quick to judge the rest of the season. My advise to you Gigi, wait @least till mid-season to say who sucks & who will succeed. Look @ Roma last year & Samp as well. Both were down in the beginning & in the end, one was fighting for the Schudetto & one managed to achieve UCL play-off spot. Milan played a newly promoted team, not a team which is the worst in the league. They can win the return leg against Milan or even beat Juve @ Turin, will you then call them the best team in the league!!!?

I watched Juve play, & I must say it's only because they have new members who are in the sqaud who are yet to know the rest of the squad movements; after a couple of games they should gel.

Gel? Who Needs Time To Gel?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 29, 2010, 8:50am PDT",,"So, can someone please take the time to answer the following questions:

(a)Why did we need to ship Giovinco and Diego out of Torino, and bring in average players like, Quags, Pepe, Lanza, Martinez? What good has that done us?

(b)Why do Coaches believe, the older Del Piero gets, the more reason for him to carry this team on his back – I mean, he showed his age today, God bless him for working harder than some of the other lumps of shit, but, honestly, he can't do it anymore, it's obvious… So why is he our only creative outlet now?

©Is Sissoko actually worse now? I mean, every time he touched the ball he lost possession. Why do we continue to resort to players like Melo and Sissoko?

(d)Marchisio: (Im going to take heat for this but…) Has he taken note of how to become a useless player like DeRossi has become? Utterly poor… Did we not let the wrong 23/24 year old go??


Just a couple of thoughts, DeCelgie played great, he covered for a fouling, over adventurous Bonucci. Motta was much better than I expected, I am happy he's here, and we will see the true potential of him come forth as the years of bench rust is removed from his back. He was exploring the offensive positions… As soon as things get a little more settled, he will be a threat.

Overall, I am disappointed with some of the directions our team is taking. It is early on, but I truly see no light in a team that acquires the likes of Pepe, Quags, Martinez and dismisses talents like Giovinco. I am shocked at the role a 35 year old Del Piero has been given on this team, you could see it in his face that he doesn't have it anymore, this is a travesty to such a beacon of a career. Average players are being given too much license here, and I hope Del Neri can realize this before we sink too far. Tactically we were second rate today, our positioning was wayyy off, our midfield was horrendous, and our fitness was nothing more than shit. The positive imo was our defense. Players like DeCeglie and Motta impressed me, Chiellini was his usual self – an inspiration, Bonucci needs to settle down – after watching yesterdays Genoa game, I cannot help but think we missed the boat on this acquisition.

Gel? Who Needs Time To Gel?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 29, 2010, 8:50am PDT",,"I said this before; I see no reason why we are two days before the transfer window closes and we STILL have work to do. Considering our DS started working on June 1st and our competitive season started at the end of July, there's really no good reason why so many deals are being done last minute. Why did we take so long to sign Krasic? Why take so long to sell Trez and Diego and sign suitable replacements? Why so long to get rid of the players who have no future with us? We started off well signing Storari, Pepe, Lanza, Bonucci, Motta, Martinez all before pre-season training started. Then Marotta apparently went on a about a month's vacation and only started back working 2 weeks ago.

Today, we witnessed the fruits of that “labour”; a team looking less like a team and more than a bunch of players running around after the ball. We looked ok in the first 15 or so, but let's be honest, Bari always had our number. Other than Melo's chance in the first half, we created nothing.

Some thoughts:
1. Can't fault Krasic or Quags. Neither played with the team before (and in Quags' case, he didn't even train) and it was always asking a lot for them to make an immediate impact. Krasic was still better than Pepe though.
2. I am convinced now that De Ceglie shouldn't be our starting LB. Just not good enough. Motta, on the other hand, was pretty good.
3. We are still going to have problems coming up against quick and tricky teams. We're just too slow.
4. Does Sissoko have a brain? He surely doesn't play like he has one.
5. Melo was our best player today, bar none. Yet he came off for the aforementioned Sissoko.
6. Martinez is already a waste of space, so why in God's name when he got injured didn't we just take him off and play with 10 men? The man could barely run! And he was just getting in other's way.
7. Delneri didn't have much to work with on the bench, but his subs were pretty boring. And the last one was just downright poor.

I believe krasic/lanza/martinez just need time to gain match fitness. Pepe, on the other hand, is not a juve material.

(b) I absolutely agree. We need a cover on the second striker position and probably, probably, Quags is meant to be that. From this game, it is clear that Quags is not a prima punta. But Amauri and Iaquinta are injured, which bring us to this: WE NEED PAZZO!!

© This one I also couldn't agree more. We need a def midfield who can organize and pass. Melo and Sissoko can't do that.

(d) I still believe in Marchisio. He's not a def midfield and he actually played better (not good, just better) after Melo was substituted. And also I believe his contract situation plays a role in this.

Agree on Bonucci needing to calm down. But with the LB playing awful and no decent covering from def midfield, what do you expect?

PDC was awful on defense… We need a new LB with a better quality. I think he's more a left winger, not a fullback. At least for now.

Gigi Del Neri feels Juventus ""would need to be improved further,"" but was impressed by their character in the Bari defeat.

The Bianconeri started off the season by losing 1-0 to Bari at the Stadio San Nicola, having fielded six new players in the starting XI.

""The team would certainly need to be improved further and the average age should also be brought down, but one must also take into account the economic situation of the club,"" said the Coach.

""We started a little afraid of keeping our defence high up the field, especially with the pace of the Bari forwards on the counter.

""We ran into some difficulties, that is beyond doubt, but also managed to create some good things.

""I very much appreciated the sacrifices made by Alessandro Del Piero and Fabio Quagliarella, who had to stay on for the whole game as I had no alternatives.

""I also liked the character of the side, as we tried to score right to the 92nd minute. Of course there have to be big improvements in the performance and cohesion, while we conceded a goal with a silly error, as we allowed them to take a free kick quickly.""",HR ,"Aug 29, 2010 ", 5:34 PM,

I think Juve will get the French defender and get a 4th string striker to replace one of the best strikers we've ever had!

Honestly, I am happy that Agnelli is heading Juve….BUT…what I dont get is when Diego said that GDN wanted him to stay and that “others” IE Marotta/Agnelli/Blanc? wanted him out?

David Trezeguet is officially no longer a Juventus player after signing for newly-promoted Spaniards Hercules Alicante.

The Frenchman ends a 10-year tenure in Turin and turned down more prestigious clubs in order to move to his wife's home town.

Hercules made the news official this evening and will pay him €1.5m per season on a two-year contract.

Trezeguet did earn €4.5m at Juventus, but the Italians will continue to pay the rest for the remaining year of his current deal.

Juventus will probably only make an official announcement on Monday, when the stock exchange re-opens.",Comrade88 ,"Aug 28, 2010 ", 3:24 PM,

Caro David,

è arrivato il momento di dirsi ciao. Ho perso il conto delle stagioni che abbiamo giocato insieme e dei gol che abbiamo fatto. Di sicuro, siamo la coppia che ne ha segnati di più nella storia della Juventus, più di Charles e Sivori – due immensi campioni – e questo lo sai bene è un grande orgoglio per entrambi.

Quante formazioni in questi anni finivano così: Del Piero e Trezeguet, Trezeguet e Del Piero. Quante vittorie, quante delusioni (per fortuna, molte meno delle soddisfazioni che ci siamo tolti), quanti abbracci: non c’è altro compagno con cui io abbia giocato di più.

Diciassette gol all’anno di media, come il tuo numero di maglia: questo basta per dire che bomber sei. Ma per me che ho giocato al tuo fianco, non c’è bisogno di numeri. Ritengo sia stato un onore fare coppia in campo con uno dei più grandi attaccanti del mondo, in assoluto.

Adesso le nostre strade si dividono, nel calcio succede. Ti saluterò nello spogliatoio, ma mi fa piacere farlo anche pubblicamente: in bocca al lupo per la tua nuova avventura. Avremo tanti bei ricordi da condividere, la prossima volta che ci vedremo.

“Trezeguet! Trezeguet! Quando gioca segna sempre Trezeguet!”

His goals against real madrid (03 and 05), that header against milan in 05 from that fantastic assist by del piero, punishing inter on our return back to serie A, and the list goes on and on. I wish him all the best.

Having seen the departure of so many players I've cared about, such as tacchinardi, davids, nedved, trezeguet makes me feel really sad. These were players that would bleed for the juve shirt. I hope to see this kind of spirit with the new juve generation, it would restore a lot of the honour that this club has lost in recent years, that fighting spirit.

Nevermind Man City(who is trying to buy every speedy attacker in Europe apparently), Man U or even Real after Kaka went down.

Diego is a very good player in the right system/league. The Serie A in a 4-4-2 without an AM isn't that. An attacker worthy of your description of him should actually score during home league games, and Diego didn't do that last season.

Its like we have a very rigid formation with many players who can be super versatile in their skills.

I saw this personally when juventus lost to the new york fucking red bulls with diego on the pitch. I guess what I am trying to say is that Diego is a great talent, and he deserves to shine in a team that works for him. Last season we built the team around him and it clearly didn't work. Now, we are building a team of components that function properly, like a machine. Its not a pretty machine yet but I believe it will be.

I think we need one consistent creative force in our line up. thats it. the formation is not beautiful but seems to be working. even when we played lyon and hamburg at the beginning something was working.

Take Greece in Euro or Jose's Porto for example. They didnt have word beaters in every single defensive position, but overall their defence could stop anything thrown at them.

The problem with our current defenders is that they are not at all well organized. I know, it's just been a few games & I'm jumping the gun here, but the defence is making one mistake or other in every single game. The quality of opposition has led to us not letting goals in. Storari is no Buffon, De Ceglie is hardly a good defender, Motta has potential but his positioning seems very suspect, he is too offensive at times. In a Motta-Chiellin-Bonucci-PDC defence too much depends on the centre-backs, none of whom are effective in being an organizer. The DMs dont give enough confidence to be effective screens. I hope Melo's good form continues, both him & Sissoko need to drop the habit of giving miss-passes in dangerous positions. This cost us many times last season.

Quagliarella Move Looking Likely and Imminent,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 26, 2010, 2:59pm PDT",,"After a good nights sleep, I am starting to think rationally again. And much as I hate to admit it, I think I am beginning to understand why Diego was so desperately offloaded.

I am now pretty sure that selling Diego was a technical rather than economic decision. Consider this – over the entire summer Marotta was desperate to sell the guy. I think the think-tank at the club favored the classic 4-2-2-2 instead of the 4-4-1-1 which modified into 4-2-3-1 in attack. Now Diego can only play in the 4-4-1-1 (he is not yet a good SP) whereas we don't have anyone else in the team who can play in that position, thanks to the Giovinco loan. ADP can, but that is not his optimal position. Good trequartistas are very rare, because it is a very specialized position, and one of huge responsibility. Moreover, in the modern game, when most top teams play a variation of 4-2-3-1, playing a pure trequartista in a 4-4-1-1 is a huge risk, since the Prima Punta will always be double marked out of the game (especially if their name is Amauri).

Now imagine this scenario – Diego is injured. What happens to our formation now that ADP/Iaquinta starts? It becomes a traditional 4-2-2-2. Only for it to reset once Diego is fit. In the long term, it simply does not make sense to switch formations so often. Also consider the fact that when (if?) Giovinco returns from loan, we will have the same problem again, Diego or Giovinco in the 4-4-1-1. Thus for the sake of stability and the tactical vision of GDN, Diego had to be sold. Its good for both the player, and the long term benefit of the team.

The problem is not why Diego was sold, but the way the operation was carried out. Firstly, I don't think we got a good enough deal, getting 15 m for a player of Diego's caliber is a joke. Next, I think we needed to do this earlier in the summer, and brought in a SP to start gelling with the team. Marotta, if he does a panic deal and the whole thing was unplanned, will appear to be totally clueless.

This brings me to the second problem – the selling of Trez. It is a sad sad day for juventini if we cannot say farewell to a bandeira – one of the greatest to ever put on the bianconeri – on the pitch. IMO, he should start ahead of Amauri easily based on form. Then again, his hold up play has gone down over the years, unlike his poaching instincts. Regardless, it is hugely disrespectful of the management to discard Trez like an old rag – a slap in the face for whatever Juve used to stand for. I never thought I would see the day when Raul would play for Schalke and Trez would play for some newly promoted La Liga side – shows you how far the values of the clubs have fallen. This was a club where world champions and world cup finalists and golden ball winners played in the Serie B. I used to think that Juve used to stand for something – guess I was wrong, and for that, my friends, you cannot blame Calciopoli.",Papai ,"Aug 27, 2010 ", 6:33 AM,

I agree with you on the module change: Juve (read: Del Neri) wants to play 4-4-2 wing-attack this season, so Diego simply did not fit into that plan. It's as simple as that. I also agree that the price we sold him for was too low, but read my hopes wishful thinking about the move in the long-run (i.e. how it ties to Dzeko). One can hope. As far as selling him is concerned it was probably a smart idea to do it now (a time when is value is still somewhat high) rather than later, after his value depreciated due to a season-long streak of inconsistent and sub-par performances, following playing in a role which wasn't his own.

As far as Trezegol goes, I think your disappointment mainly comes from two factors: that he wasn't given an opportunity to retire at Juve (fair), or that he isn't leaving for a more prestigious club. However as far as I know, Trez has never been mistreated during this time. Simply, it was time for him to leave. He's given us a lot, and we could probably squeeze some more goals out of him another year. But doing so goes against the strategy of the current management, which is to start afresh and bring new, younger players to build foundations for the Old Lady future. That is: get rid of all the old or overrated (sometimes both) high-wage earners: Grosso, Zebina, Camoranesi, etc. etc.

is Trez's deal done, anyway? given that Amauri got slight problem and Iaq is in long layoff, wouldn't it be better to keep him? it would be tactically weird if ADP should lead the line as PP while all of our wingers prefer sending crosses after crosses into the box to cutting inside, because i perceive a lack of skills and willingness from them to do the latter",hant00 ,"Aug 27, 2010 ", 6:55 AM,
Quagliarella Move Looking Likely and Imminent,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 26, 2010, 2:59pm PDT",,"Nah, it was a good post, especially about Trez.

I'm pretty resigned to Diego leaving at this point. I think on the whole we're building a good squad for the future. If we cover LB/CB with another signing after Quagliarella, we'll have decent (not great, but decent) players at every position. Our signings in future seasons will, I hope, be bigger 'star' names or hot prospects that bring us back to the top level (I'd still love to see Dzeko arrive, for instance), but right now we're working towards having a deeper, more flexible squad than in recent years, with players like Martinez who can fill a number of roles, and with younger, hardworking Italians at the core.

Importantly, we're also in a healthy financial position and well on course to comply with FIFA's financial fair play rules, which very few of the other major clubs across Europe can claim. For instance, I read just now that we're going to be paying Quag a 'mere' €2.5m per season. That's less than half of what Wolfsburg are now paying Diego.

On the downside, I really do think the 4-4-2 is stale and outdated in modern football. When you look at all the truly successful sides of the past few years, they all seem to play modified 4-3-3s or 4-2-3-1s, with the extra man in midfield and an emphasis on inverted wingers/forwards who can cut inside and shoot. I can see Delneri's staid formation being more of a problem than the players he chooses to fill it with.",ShakeAppeal ,"Aug 27, 2010 ", 6:54 AM,

Quagliarella Move Looking Likely and Imminent,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 26, 2010, 2:59pm PDT",,"Well Diego has gone and Marotta has his work cut out for him now. I'm not sold on Quagliarella, their is no doubt that he is a decent professional and a gifted player, but I don't think he has the required quality to succeed at Juve. Quagliarella is far too inconsistent and at 27 years old he is unlikely to improve his game. I think the management would be smarter to go for G. Rossi who is a younger, more talented alternative.

I'm slightly worried regarding the potential defensive arrivals. Capdevila is a decent fullback, but at 32 years old this nothing more than a stop gap. Historically Spanish players have never done particularly well in Serie A. Having watched him play for Villareal on a number of occasions, he is better offensively than defensively and I don't think he will fit into Del Neri's tactical system. This has all the hallmarks of the Grosso signing and that didn't work out well for us.

Regarding Benalouane the young 23 year old defender, what baffles me is that we are willing to take a risk on him whilst not giving a chance to players such as Giovinco, Edkal and Ariaudo. I've never seen Benalouane play, thus I cannot make any judgement on him, but signing a player who supposedly lost his place in the Saint Etienne first team half way through last season doesn't bode well. These signings are beginning to feel like panic buys! I cannot understand why we haven't made a move to secure Bocchetti who at 23 years old, has a wealth of Serie A experience, has played in the Europa League and has caps for the national team, not to mention his versatility.

This is exactly what I said, it's not the same, it's an evolution.

No one ever said that the team weak just because of the formation (at least I never said that). And it isn't just about what's fashionable, it's about what's most effective. Looking at Juve's games so far, even going back to Ranieri's days, there was always a gap between the midfield and forwards, leading to long balls that are easily cut off by aerially imposing defenders. Why do you think we've been so bad against English teams (not counting Fulham, that was an anomaly – talking about more the Chelsea's and Man U's)? A “traditional 4-4-2” is ancient mate. Is the easiest formation to adopt and the easiest to nullify. Unless you have truly exceptional players you'll only do so much. That's just how it is.

And for me, the issue is more this proclomation of a “system” as if it's set in stone and cannot be amended, like the Ten Commandments, and players not “fitting in”.

There's nothing to explain. Spring 2009, just like most of the following year, was a bad moment of form. I like to think of a player's value in terms of the highest possible talent he can achieve.

As far as Amauri is concerned, I want to consider the top-moments he had with Palermo, and the top ones he had with Juve, especially in the Champions League where he was towering above every defender's head and it seemed he could not stop scoring.

Melo was great. Played simple and took little risks, the way he always should. Momo was good but on the floor to much for me. The CBs where great and got forward well. PDC and Motta looked good but need to still work on their timing going forward. Pepe ran and ran, and provided some nice passes. I do enjoy seeing him settle back when Motta goes forward, good selfless play. Martinez wasn't too bad, especially up top. And of course Del Piero is just class.

I know some people are going to go negative with their thoughts. We didnt finish, looked bad against the counter at times, shotty defending on the run, it's on Strum Graz, etc. and thats your perogative. Some of us are just critical people by nature. But I must say I really enjoyed the game tonight.

I'll miss Diego, but tonights game took my mind off the mercato for once. Thank god! I can't wait for September 1st and to see more performances like this.

2) Diego provided tons of creativity last year. We just didn't have the strikers, the support from midfield, or the fullbacks to help him. We flopped last season because our coaches played with zero creativity in midfield (we performed much better when Camo played in the midfield 3), a static Amauri-Iaquinta combination upfront, and defensive fullbacks. Stop Diego, and you would eliminate ALL creativity upfront – and that is exactly what the opposition did.

For those of you that didn't like the match… relax, we were missing Marchisio, Aquilani, and Krasic. I doubt Marchisio and Aquilani will play together often but they could have given our side more flair and creativity. I know we haven't seen Krasic play either but he has to be better than Pepe which means more creativity again.

Martinez wasn't bad either, and he can only improve from there. PDC and Motta were good enough, and for the first time PDC didn't screw up massively on defense (you might be right after all Aaron). Melo and Sissoko helped us keep possession and shut down Stum greatly. Someone said that midfielders in Serie A will not allow Melo that kind of space. I beg to differ, Melo was playing closer to our defense than before and we had 5 midfielders (Lanzaframe, Melo, Momo, Pepe, and Martinez), this meant that if someone went to close down Melo they would leave a hole in the middle which will be enough for us to exploit, I think that was a good tactical move by Delneri much more so than Stum being horrible (which they were).

Alex was sublime and his goal great.

Now it seems we will get Quagliarela. I have never been convinced by him but hopefully he can give us some of the goals we need. If Marotta signs a top scorer (I am looking at you Pazzini) and another left back then we will be set.

I like my team ruthless. 1-0 to me is just as good at 3-0 when we played this comfortable. Last year, every time we went up 1-0 it looked like it was a matter of time before we conceded a goal. Today, it looked like we weren't going to concede.

It thus makes sense for the Nerazzurri to want to blow off steam and release their frustration at the commonly-believed concept of the time: “Juventus, the big Serie A juggernaught that was usually winning every year's scudetto, were doing so because of refereeing favors”. Senza Rubare thus becomes an outcry, a chant from the white (or in this case, black & blue) knights triumphing over injustice.

In other words, it's all for show. I for one, don't hold Stankovic, Burdisso, or anyone else present in that room accountable for it.

Marotta, and other sporting directors / managers who know what they're doing, should think with their head, not with their heart. Sign the players for what they bring on the field for God's sake. Anyone who complains about Burdisso's tendency to fuck-up will receive my support: even though his recent season with Roma has been very good, I'll admit Burdisso's error-prone past still haunts him somewhat. That's what makes this move doubtful. The fact that, even though people change (some in positive; look at Legrottaglie), there's a degree of uncertainty with Burdisso's consistency. NOT his past comments about Juventus.

Sincerity, integrity, love of the shirt… all these great positive traits are important if you're electing someone for Juve sainthood. But as we all know, declarations of love for any particular club (“it was my childhood dream to play for Real Madrid”) are often as real as Alvaro Recoba's Repubblica Italiana passport. The truth is we're not planning to sign (if the rumor is true) Burdisso to be a role model for future generations of Juventini & to inspire them to become Bianconeri players. No. We're planning to sign him because he's a professional soccer player, he plays center defense, and we expect him to play professionally for us just like he did at Roma.

So please, let's leave the “ZOMG he said 'Juve suxx' on 08-03-2003 Fuck him 4life” comments at home. We're better than that.",Marco P. ,"Aug 26, 2010 ", 3:55 AM,

Diego was playing to deep anyway, without a real threat to goal. He doesn't fit well in our team, 'though he remains world-class.

The End of All Things Holy,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 25, 2010, 9:58pm PDT",,"To be completely honest as much as I like Diego, I can understand the reasoning behind selling him. He no longer fits our tactical system and unfortunately he isn't clinical enough to play as a seconda punta. The problem is that if we are to sell him then we need to find a adequate replacement. Di Natale would be a terrible signing. Thankfully it appears as if he wants to stay at Udinese. The guy is almost 33 years old, in all honesty his 29 goals last season simply highlights the decline of Serie A in my opinion. He has had 2 international tournaments to show his ability for Italy and he failed both times. We are a club building for the future and signing an almost 33 year old player is absolutely disgraceful. In regards to Burdisso, this is another terrible signing. Once again we are massively overpaying for a very average defender. Burdisso is simply not good enough. Why are we not trying to sign Bocchetti or Barzagli who are both far better players and would command a similar transfer fee. Upfront with the potential departure of both Diego and Trezeguet, it has become imperative to now sign a quality striker. Pazzini is an exceptional player and would certainly solve our goal scoring problem, but replacing Diego will be very difficult. I think Guiseppe Rossi is a great call. Villareal are in massive debt and over the last 12 months Rossi's value has surely depreciated after an injury hit campaign and his failure to secure a world cup spot. But their is no doubt that Rossi is a fantastic talent who will surely blossom into a world class striker and at the age of 23 is a sound investment. The other name I'd like to mention is Robinho. He looks set to leave Man City in the next few days and has expressed his desire to play in Italy. He is one of the best players in the world and has shown his quality in both la liga and the premiership. The only question mark is his attitude. I think he needs to feel loved and appreciated at a club and perhaps at Juve he could find this. We could probably secure him on a loan deal as Man City have to announce their 25 man list within the coming days and he doesn't appear to be on that list. One thing is for sure, Marotta has left himself with a lot of work to do now. Just hearing on sky sports news that the Diego deal is almost complete, he is having a medical.

On response(s) that said that i'm not worthy of being a Juvefan, should be banned altogether, etc. i say this: at some point, i think any club fan has been put into emotional hell by the club's management. at that point he/she is prone to go as far as renouncing the support because the nature of being a fan is being emotional, while logic and reason usually come later. i mean, when our club's doing something stupid, we'd be so enraged that the other good values and things done in the club would be clouded over. when logic and reason intervene, we'd see that ultimately one bad move shouldn't tarnish everything else (in most cases, anyway) and perhaps we'd see that that one move was actually for the greater good. These are what happened to me in the last 24hr, helped by reading comments from my fellow Juvefans here. so for some of you more seasoned Juvefan that is offended by my statement, i am sorry. it was stupid, but i think it's a necessary phase in a true fan's life, like some of you had also encountered (e.g. when Baggio left, or perhaps Aaron is/was up there in last paragraph?). perhaps my biggest mistake was publicly declaring it then..

in the same tune as my reply to one of you, i wholeheartedly agree that supporting a club means that it should come first, above any player however good or even legendary he is/was. in that regard, i would like to say that my concern is not Diego's leaving per se (substitute Diego with any good player from last season and i'd still be enraged), but more on how management is willing to release a player that clearly has something to prove and clearly determined to do so because of his love and passion to the club. besides, as most of you have exhausted the argument, selling Diego at this point wouldn't be too lucrative anyway, either in terms of fees earned or the players captured as replacement, even if there are clearly some minuses too if he stays (tactically incompatible, being in ADP's shadow, etc.)

delving further into the matter above, i fear that if this way of player management persists (like one of you hopes against regarding our new beloved MK27), our future targets will perceive that Juventus is a club that doesn't value passion that much. the line that divide professionals and mercenaries will be getting thinner..

that's it, i hope it would pacify the anger, and excuse me if it's too boring to read (or perhaps one more comment too many from me, for some of you who already stamped me as “Juve infidel” and full of bullshit)",hant00 ,"Aug 26, 2010 ", 11:31 AM,

Maybe Pazzini's release clause is not as high as has been reported, Marotta would know that.

The truth is we don't know what will happen by Sept 1st. And even then when we have all the names who will be defending our colors next season (and even we may not like some or much of those names due to their past or previous performances) we should keep in mind that someone who was hired to save the sinking ship has plenty of confidence on those names, and we should respect that. Lets give Marotta, Delneri and all our new players time to prove themselves. And I'm not talking about 3 games, I'm talking about the whole season.

It's going to be a long and painful season but not because of our players or our transfer campaign, but because of you fellow juventini, who will be calling for everyone's head since week three, because:

- whenever the seconda punta we will hire misses a pass, you will comapre him with an “already kindly modified by our memories” Diego: Who wouldn't EVER miss a pass like that in a million years, and who could dribble the entire opposite team a couple of times before delivering the same killers pass… with his butt.

- because whoever the new striker we will sign is, he will be compared to Trez when he misses a sure goal. Because as all of you know, Trez never misses goals, and in the same exact position where this poor new “reinforcement” (yeah, we dare call him reinforcement ironically since he clearly weakened our beloved team) missed that crucial goal, Trez could have scored blindfolded, and Trez goal would have counted as two goals you know? cuz Trez goals are just too fabulous to be considered just as one goal.

- And well, plain simply, because Malaka's dance is ridiculous.

We can't compare name by name the new players with the players who left, we have to take a look at this as a whole new project, with imperfections as everything in life, but a project that will be taking shape with time. It will take time to gel all of our new players into a new system under a new coach.

i'm not frm Italy at all , but when I saw my first international football game ever 16years ago i fell in love with those zebra dudes. as they where smashing opponents apart,in the colest way i ever say. then i noticed this club had something special because they keep on smashing simply everybody,

by growing older and wiser you understand this takes lots of strength,determination,hard work, class, good vision, strong camaraderie and teamwork etc. all values and virtues i appreciate A LOT in real life
so its very nice to identify you with your favorite club. this is for me above all why i loved juve above all other teams( ok wont deny i completely love layers like adp zizou etc,..)

juve always stood for fear and respect! through all Europe, no matter if its barca , rea, man u, or whatever, everybody simply know the club of juventus is simply an institution you won't pass that easily.

many juvefans, including myself staid loyal after the calciopoli, stripping 2 deserved titles away from our palmares, reducing one of worlds strongest teams apart and regulate to serie B,… truly heartbreaking, but loyalty nevr question, because you know simply juve DNA , juve code, juve spirit alone will bring them back to greatness.

its painful to see after keeping faith and hope for 5 years, you feel your hope was in vain,…
its not just because of diego is getting sold,… its because a player like him, with old juve standards, will always had his chance to shine, juve always gave young talented players the chance to develop to absolute world class( del piero, davids, zidane, baggio, many more)

seeing the board lost their faith in Italy's most prospect talents(gio) and now ditching diego, because this is what it is,…ditching, no matter who's coming in( ok aside form xavi, messi or rooney:))you realise lots have changed with the juve dna,… this cheap sell of diego stands for me we are not building patiently to world class and glory, but to a nice team, i'm thinking roma level,…strong, also doing nice in Europe but never actually play for real silverware,….

Only one club was interested in him and the market determines the prize. Cristiano Ronaldo is not worth 100m or whatever but someone wanted to pay that much so his prize is so. Same for Ibrahimovic, he is not worth 40m + Eto.

The End of All Things Holy,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 25, 2010, 9:58pm PDT",,"Having watched Samp's performance in Europe last week it highlighted how bad and out-of touch a rigid 4-4-2 can be at the moment. I thought Samp were very unlucky to lose the tie as most of Werder's goals came from individual mistakes and had enough chances to score more. However they could not keep the ball at all and most the time looked for the quick long ball out to the wing or to Cassano. The gap between the mid and Cassano in the first leg was huge and so Samp would keep on losing the ball. This is how GDN plays and for it to work you need complete players, Palombo and Tissone are mainly defensive mids not box-to-box. I know GDN likes to have a deeper striker which I believe Diego would of been good for and then have an aerial and physical threat as the main striker Pazzini/Amuari.

My main point is that I worry that the manager of Juve is so stuck on one formation and is getting rid of a talented, techincal playmaker such as Diego because he doesn't believe he will suit it. And when you add in the fact that the formation is this rigid 4-4-2 which no successful team that has won recently uses makes it even worst.
A big team like Juve needs a manager who is able to manipulate the squad depending on each occasion not just stick to a blueprint that has worked at Cheivo, Atalanta and Samp",Edds10 ,"Aug 26, 2010 ", 2:55 PM,

In the Diego case, correct me if I'm wrong, but in Italy fantasista is like the air you breathe. To this day, I believe most brazilian's attacking midfielders are not fantasistas. They need the ball at their feet ALL THE TIME. Only Kaka is the exception.

Sure we can play other formations like 4-2-3-1, but what we need is not a central att midfielder who needs the ball all the time. We need a fantasista who can change the course of the game with one touch. And Diego is not that player.

Mehmet Topal was transferred from Galatasaray to VCF this summer for 4 M euros….Since every one knows about our financial constraints we negotiated to pay it in installments…but Galatasaray wanted a 2/3rds up front but VCF could afford only 1/3rd…So Topal who always wanted to play with a top european team loaned our club the extra 1.5 Million upfront to pay for his move….he willreceive the money he lent later along with his salaries…

Krasic Shells Out 10k to Show Up Ontime,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 25, 2010, 9:52am PDT",,"Don't bring morals into this. If Diego ends up leaving is also because he wants to. No one will put a gun to his head and make him sign the contract. He knows full well if he stays he will probably be picked over ADP and will have a starting spot most important games. He is leaving because Marotta found a place that will pay enough money for him and because he will get paid well. Rumors a couple of weeks ago were around 6m per season so it is more money that he is getting paid now and in a league that he knows.

As someone else said in the last post he also has the added pressure to perform. He plays 45 minutes badly, ADP comes in and scores a free kick and is enough for the media to start speculating that Diego won't have playing time. In this case I am not saying that ADP has too much power in the dressing room (which I believe he does) but I think Giovinco and Diego are both living under Del Piero's shadow (at least with the fans and in the media). In the case of Diego he can move away from all of that and start fresh in an ambitious club like Wolfsburg.

No player is greater than Juve and we are in a rebuilding phase. Moggi has always said, Diego is a hard player to accommodate, you have to play the right formation and have the right players for him to flourish. Diego didn't have the right players last year and according to Marotta he doesn't have the right players this year either.

Juve has to function as a unit, the stars will come later and might be developing right now (Immobile, Libertazzi, and even Giovinco while at Parma). Next year we have to be compact, concede little and score some. Di Natale is old but he scored more goals than all of our strikers last year. If he hits half of that we will be good, he is also a squad player, one that will work hard and keep his mouth shut. Same as Pazzini, he is a great striker and is really coming of age, he showed that much yesterday.

Before you crucify Marotta, remember that Diego is also signing off in the dotted line, I am sure he also has his reasons to leave, beyond the faith the club has in him.",Jose ,"Aug 25, 2010 ", 4:03 PM,

Diego will be our 1st choice seconda punta, unless he lets ADP get ahead of him in which case I am all game for benching the Brazilian, the most in form player should play.

What I am saying is that if he moves it won't be for playing time. What else is important for a player… the coach's confidence? I think Diego has Delneri's confidence, maybe Delneri would prefer other players but if Diego stays he will have Delneri's confidence. What else does he need?. I see Marotta saying 20m is enough for us to sell you, if you are interested and you want to leave we won't stop you. I think that is the most reasonable way of doing things.

Tactically this is another story. We loose our creative spark, just when we though Aquilani, Krasic, and Diego were going to light the field on fire. Is having Di Natale and Pazzini worse than having Diego and Amauri. I don't know, I'd rather have Diego and Pazzini but that is clearly not going to happen. I do have my problems with Diego, I think he holds on to the ball for too long and that he drops to far back into the middle to get a ball, those things can be corrected but clearly the 4-4-2 is not natural to him.

As for the coach adapting his strategy. There are two types of coaches, ones that believe in a system to death and ones that will modify it from game to game. Both approaches have been successful in football (Capello vs. Mourinho). Delneri belongs to the former category, that doesn't take anything away from him. We will have Delneri for 10 more months at least, calling him names despite him winning 3 official games so far (admittedly unconvincingly) is not going to help building the confidence of Juve.",Jose ,"Aug 25, 2010 ", 8:41 PM,

1. Diego leaving isn't SO bad. i'd rather he stayed as he is pretty much our only real source of creativity, but truth be told he really doesn't fit the system. we should get an SS such as Robinho or Cassano (don't you think its strange that the rumours start that Diego will leave as soon as Samp get knocked out? surprised the media hadn't picked up on that).
Even IF we get Di Natale (who if it wasn't for his age would be a wonderful signing), that would be mean we have Alex, Iaquinta, and ADN to play as the SS, who between the three of them should make 1 season.

2. Why on earth is ANYONE against us signing Burdisso. Hes a great defender, and in my mind is comfortably better than Bonucci AT THE MOMENT.

I mean come on, those mofos dumping Diego, and seek Di Natale as his replacement!! This is not Juventus. Not Juventus that I know, and adore.

My thought about your thoughts:
1. How's Diego leaving isn't so bad if they seek a replacement in the shape of ADN? That's beyond bad. A complete madness and idiocity, IMO. Doesn't fit the system argument is nonsense. How do we know? No one knows what's going to happen. You might have a point if you'd said, “Diego doesn't fit into Italian football”, like what Moggi's claimed long long time ago. But then again, it's unfair to judge him after just one season in a completely shambles side of Juventus 2009/2010. Not even Zidane can save that team.

Cassano wanted to retire in Samp. Good for him as I don't see him having that extra determination to do well in other club. As for Robinho, NO!!! Why? Try this: bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2010/08/vickery_18.html

Someone who has a terrible first touch like Iaq should stay far away from Seconda Punta spot in any team in high level football. Vincenzo, despite his versatility, never flourished in other position other than Prima Punta.

2. Oh yes, he's such great defender Inter couldn't wait to offloaded him. Burdisso is a mediocre defender. He's one of the most error-prone def I've ever know. He's so error-prone he makes Nelson Rivas look like a Gentile. Not a very bright lad too, I suppose. One season wonder in Roma won't change anything.

3. Libertazzi is a talanted kid. Know him since his first year at the primavera, 2 years ago. He's the youngest member of the squad at that time, class of '92 while most of his teammates were '89 (because he's just too good for kids at his age, he skipped the Berretti phase). Now, he's the only Juventino on Italy's U-19 team.

I was always a big fan, but he's really coming to his own this season and filling Ozil's shoes. Hopefully we still can get him sometime soon, possibly in the winter or next summer.

When it comes to strikers, i think we should get rid of Iaquinta. Trezeguet probably only has about 2 seasons left in him, MAYBE 3, but no matter how he is, if you give him a crack at goal, he's gonna score more often than not. And Amauri may not be the beast he was back at Palermo or when we first got him, but he's still got quality, moreso than Iaquinta in my opinion, and he's showing that recently. He's actually had a good preseason. The striker i would buy? There's plenty i would be happy with, but what i think we need to do is go for someone that's not a huge name, so no Dzeko, Forlan, Benzema, etc cause they'll cost too much. Go for Kiessling, Gomez, Helmes, Cardozo, Barrios, Guiza, Ibisevic, etc. I would personally prefer Helmes of all of them. He'd be one of the cheapest of that group, with him being out of favor at Leverkusen since his injury, and is better than Kiessling in my opinion. Remember the 08/09 season, Helmes scored i think 19 goals in the Bundesliga, more than Kiessling. He's a striker that can guarantee around 20 goals or more, and would be a bargain.

A couple of days ago a read an interview to Delneri where mentioned that Trez wasn't happy that he wasn't playing, and Delneri said that he shouldn't worry cuz things could change from one day to the other.

Another hint at that is Trez's agent commenting about the options of going to Liverpool or Zaragoza. The agent said that Trez might not find the space he wanted with liverpool but in Zaragoza he would enjoy lots of playing time. On the other hand the spaniss team does not have the funds to complete the transfer, but that a completely different story.

So, if Trez wants regular playing time (and Delneri can't provide that), and he is willing to leave Juventus for that regular playing time, I'd say we should let him leave, with a proper good bye as he deserves.

As much as I love Diego, I think he's not a fantasista. Roby Baggio is a fantasista, so is Totti, and so is Cassano. But Diego is a superb attacking midfielder who needs the ball at his feet all the time. What we really need is a fantasista, or a second striker, and Diego is none of that. That's why we've seen GDN try to convert him to be a second striker.

With the showings so far, Diego should stay. But then The Wolfe came calling, Beppe listened, then Van der Vaart became available, then the Wolfe upped the offer…. One thing led to another, and voilla!!",Dboy1975 ,"Aug 25, 2010 ", 2:09 PM,

1. Seems like standard 4-4-2 doesn't fit him well. He's more like 4-3-1-2 or 4-2-3-1 guy. Where the team relying on his creativity. But this 4-4-2 Juve is built with hardworking spirited one.
2. He seems being force to play at his best all the time. Like people scrunitizing him, and he's kinda living being a shadow of del piero. To be honest i feel like he's playing with pressure.
3. With no trequista (am i spell it right ?), i think the midfielders have more room to roam. Especially the Central Midfielder, they have more space (and confidence) to go forward which diego usually occupy. And with 2 pure forward, we will press the defence.
4. The system will be as it is without diego. 4-4-2. No formation change (i hope). That should make the players gel well.
5. As far as i know, no brazilian ever make huge impact on this club.

VotD: It's time to get Crazy,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 24, 2010, 3:05pm PDT",,"all good points, but..
1. hardwork-and-spirit-based gameplan would only work in an established squad, where 90% of the squad are already comfortable playing with each other. are current Juve like that? Decidedly not, because these are totally revamped team (with at least 3 new first-teamers playing at any given time) and new system brought by a new coach. in this inevitable state of confusion due to adaptation, a little creativity would never go amiss.
2. trivial point. pressure was coming because of his status as a newcomer with high pricetag, it's inevitable. it was amplified because everybody around him was averagely suck. Ultimately, he did thrive on that pressure (see assists and fouls suffered argument). no comment on ADP comparison
3. yes the midfileders will have more room, but what good would it be if the one who's roaming is one of this bunch: Melo, Momo, Marchisio, Aqui. none of which has exceptional passing range or, more generally speaking, playmaking ability. OK, perhaps the latter two could step up as trequartista (or rather 5/8), but each of them currently has niggling problems thus cannot be fully relied upon to take that role (Marchisio with post-WC low mood and contract problem, Aqui with being new and made of glass). and two pure forwards (i shall take liberty in defining that phrase as “forwards who won't track back”) without linker in mid will spell doom, as we'd seen last season
4. no decent coach would force a system “as it is”. he should be able and willing to adapt. even Delneri himself at Samp adapted his 442 to suit Cassano's slighty-withdrawn role, to great success. so why shoudn't he be able to do the same with Diego, even if they're not exactly the same kind of player?
5. well i can only name Altafini, but why should it matter? this one is weak, both your argument and my counter, i must admit

my final argument is: GIVE HIM A CHANCE!! i'd bet anything that a nice guy like Diego will never find his market value dropped significantly like Melo due to his antics. if this season he fails to impress, i believe we can still recapture a decent amount when we sell him at the end of the season.",hant00 ,"Aug 25, 2010 ", 3:17 PM,

VotD: It's time to get Crazy,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 24, 2010, 3:05pm PDT",,"1. Yes you're right. That's what my #4 point. 4-4-2. Static, only 4-4-2, not trying 4-3-1-2, 4-2-3-1, etc etc. And yes, being used to something needs time.
2. Well, remember when we played against shamrock on 2nd leg ? he played about 60-70 mins IIRC, then ADP comes, score goal. Then he react with disbelief. And when we against sturmz gantz, ADP comes, give amauri an assist and freekick with that hit the right post. When an old 35 yo ADP can make more impact in about 15-20 mins, than diego were in 60-70 mins, that must give me considerable amount of pressure. He's (and people) comparing him with ADP.
3. This we'll see. And i think most of our CM are basically consist of players that maintaning the balance between attack and defense. Eventually i think we'll play with CM(marchisio, aquaman)-DM(melo, sissoko). I believe GDN will see this as a more balance 4-4-2. I am sorry, what i meant 2 pure forward are forward that have the basic nature of scoring goal. Target man type and second striker type (unfortunately, diego doesn't fit on any ofthis criteria).
4. What i mean is like this #1 post. I don't think GDN is the kind of coach that will go from 4-4-2 to 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3, etc by adapting with the opponent tactics. Basically, it's 4-4-2. But the player movement will move accordingly. As for Cassano, i consider him a SS type.
5. Couldn't agree more.

I agree we should give him more chance. But my post is according with the basis what's the management thinking ? Why sell diego and Trez ? I agree, Trez is a one of the best poacher i see. He should retire at Juve, like nedved. Unfortunaly, that's not happening.
But i see diego as a dilema. He's naturally a trequista who would do great with 4-3-1-2 or 4-2-3-1. Right now, he's trying hard to become a SS. That give him a pressure that makes him not performing as he is.

All diego needs is to be given a proper finisher up front who has decent pace and good movement (which we don't have) and good wingers to support him which he has now. At the most I'd say give him a second chance because he is only going to improve after the first season. I don't think marchisio can be a great central creative player. He does his duties well distributes the ball forward and plays a tidy game. But he cannot be a proper creative force, if you know what I mean. Aquilani (and I'm pretty sure of this) will not even play half a season with his record of injuries (though he is a brilliant player). Among the possible strikers we can bring in the only players who will come in for 20 mill or less will be (a) huntelaar or (b) benzema (and that may also not happen because madrid have only one proper striker in higuain) so what do you think juve can get for 20 mill?

Trez leaving I have less of a hard time with. His salary is expensive and it seems like Delneri will put more faith in Amauri and Iaquinta. I think Trez is a better striker than those two but if he brings in fresh funds for someone even better so be it.

Di Natale can be Trez's replacement, he will come in cheap and gives us pace. Remember, GDN likes pacey players, Krasic fits that, Trez… not so much. Diego, although he is not pacey he can open up spaces and pass the ball very well to the wings, although sometimes he does a little too much.

And if (IFFFFFF) FIFA decides to get retroactive and decide to take away those 12 points for inter, shouldn't we be the scudetto winners of that year (given that we finished 2nd 10 points behind)? LOL!

Especially with him coming close to finding his best form recently. Di Natale would be an excellent buy, especially for 7 million, but even though he was a very late bloomer, with his best season of his career being last season, i'm still not sure he's young enough anymore, or if he has the quality and range of Diego. And Aquilani is not a replacement for Diego at all.

BTW though, i would LOVE to get Demichelis. Great, experienced defender who is very underrated, easily Bayern's best centerback, even if he has the occasional attention lapse (though Badstuber will become better than him most likely).",Armando ,"Aug 24, 2010 ", 4:15 PM,

"Aquilani passes his medical, signing imminent",The Offside Juventus,"Aug 23, 2010, 9:19am PDT",,"in an interview after the siging of krasic …marotta was quoted as saying that juve were still on the look-out for a defender and a midfielder …here's my bit on how it should pan out

1. midfield … before aquaman we were strongly linked with ledesma and i was looking forward to him joining us. however with the imminent arrival of' il principe' that move looks less likely now. if u ask me they are different types of midfielders … while alberto is more at-home in a slighly-advanced role (trequartista/no. 10) ledesma is more of the deep-lying midfield orchestrator we had in mind with our porsuits of xabi alonso and gaetnao d'agsostino n i think he'd be more comfortable in delneri's 4-4-2 alongside a destroyer like melo/momo
be that as it may, alberto should sign in a few hours ann therefore i don't think we'll be signing anyone else in midfield . i'm still not sure how/where he'll fit in delneri's 4-4-2, but fielding him alongisde marchisio does not appear on paper a viable formation bcuz IMO neither of them have the combative/destructive nous needed for a CM duo … as it is, we look set to sail with melo,momo,marchisio & aquilani in central midfield … fair enough

2. defence … we need an extra centreback as much we need a deputy RB and a new LB (IMO deceglie is at best deputy material …FOR NOW!) … accordingly we should be looking at a defender who can play in 2/3 of those positions … save for sevilla's adriano (who barcelona have already signed!) there r not too many players out there who fit this bill
off-the-top-of-my-head i'd say barzagli and caceres , but while both of them would do quite well as fullbacks, i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with either of them as a centreback
demichelis and burdisso on the other hand are better at CB, but rather dodgy in the fullback positions …
in an ideal world, i'd say sign one each of burdisso/demichelis and caceres/barzagli and we'd be ready to roll… if however we had to sugn just one more player then i'd go with barzagli for reasons of his versatility like i said earlier

I know it is a very balanced and at times reliable system, but it seems many European teams are starting to play a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation, which for me is the way we should be going, it is modern football, playing between the lines, and it will suit all our players.

We will be totally overrun in midfield because we will not have an extra man, which a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 will have. A 4-4-2 will only work for us if our midfield is very solid and hard to breakdown, which is not the case right now. Imagine a forward line of Krasic, Diego and lanzafame all supporting iaquinta, possibly Dzeko next year. That would cause any defence problems.

We all saw how England were destroyed by Germany, not mainly because of poor performances of their star players, but because the Germans had an extra play-maker in ozil. Even last night, this could have been the reason why Liverpool were dismantled by Mancity.

One good thing which i must mention – MELO MADE A VERY GOOD GAME IMO! I can't say the same for Marchisio but he do also good game. The problem still remains in our fullback – out of positions and no answer for fast players.PDC constantly was covered by somebody (even EL malaka help him once on time). Motta is first choice but he needs to improve DEFENSIVELY for sure.
ADP and TREZ upfront can be second option IMO. i't was visible after AMAURI_Diego in that we look a bit better, simply because Diego kept the ball till the others around come in front and organizie something. WE STILL NEED MORE CREATIVITY AROUND HIM CAUSE WE DIDN'T NAVE MORE THAN 1-2 CLEAR OPPORTUNITIES,I HOPE THAT KRASIC IS GONNA HELP HIM A LOT.
i also believe that Aquilani can transform in our Pirlo – just to make these nice long balls which PIRLO DID ALL FIRST HALF and gave Pdc troubles.

I couldn't tell how much money each prize is comprised of though, but in terms of hierarchy the biggest income comes from the UEFA Champions League, followed by the Europa League, and then Serie A. The biggest source of revenue doesn't come from prize money though, but TV rights (which are not dependent on a team's final victory, but rather how many games it plays). Which is why missing out to even qualify for the UCL makes such a big dent in clubs' finances.

What's interesting is that last year, Bobby McMahon of the Fox Soccer Channel made an analysis, and discovered that should a team fail to qualify for the UCL, they can technically still overcome their missed income by making it all the way to the final of the Europa League.",Marco P. ,"Aug 22, 2010 ", 5:19 AM,

The big clubs you cited earn more money because they probably get paid more in TV rights (e.g. buying the rights to Manchester vs. Bayern is much more appealing, and therefore costs more than say, Sampdoria vs. Marseille). That makes sense.

also i'm certain we won't get him on loan as barca know we won't buy. however he is very versatile (and young) so would be a useful signing, but the way some of you talk about him you'd think he was maicon.

Officially Official: Aquilani to Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 21, 2010, 11:52am PDT",,"“Good players are on loan and bad players are bought”.

- Pepe on loan is a good deal because he probably will be heading back to Udine next year
- Lanzaframe is on loan but we own half of his transfer so the loan is cheap, it gives us a good promising Italian and we don't have to pay Zamparini an arm and a leg… at least not yet
- Motta is good but still a promise, he has a year to get better or if not next year we can target Cassani. I think that is a great move.
- Aquilani is made of glass, and I am still unsure where he fits in our team. One way or another he is a different player than anyone we have and can really make a difference if he listens to Delneri. If he is always injured and causing problems he can be shipped back, if he is masterfully controlling the strings of Juve by January then I think the rumored 16m is not too much.

As for the players we bought, I am willing to give Martinez a chance when fit. Krasic is NOT the new Nedved but I think Diego will really thrive with Krasic's speed.

Marotta is buildling a team, and one to qualify to CL to. A team has stars but it also has hardworking players. Look at Inter, they sell Ballotelli and are trying to get Kuyt. Or Holland, Kuyt played over Van der Vaart because Kuyt is a workhorse, less technical but he will run the full field and never give up. I think if we make it to the CL next year, you will see a few of the loans not renewed and we might start buying those great players we are all wanting.",Jose ,"Aug 22, 2010 ", 1:35 PM,

Figure it this way, he came from a foreign league, and only played for 4-5 months or so before he had that abdominal issue. Considering, he adapted pretty quick and well, in the Lazio game he was pretty poor but he matured quickly. Defensively he is pretty good, remember his MOTM game against Inter, and offensively he brings plenty of pace and energy. His crossing isn't perfect, but it's plenty adequate. He already knows Juve, he's not a big gamble, and I think he'd like to come back. That's why we should be grabbing him. Has immense potential, far more (and better currently) than Motta or PDC.

Hodgson did say he wanted Alberto to go to a club where he will be the number one name on the team list so he can play consistently, and he probably won't be that at Juve. Which is okay, it just makes me think some other clubs may have a better chance of snapping him up (Fiorentina, Sampa, etc.)

Not only are we getting good, targeted replacements on the transfer market (as in, players we actually need) to replace all the has-beens, but we are doing so by keeping the budget relatively in check.

To summarize:
1) Got rid of all the (some worthless) high-wage earners. Cannavaro's gone, Zebina seems a done deal. Grosso & Camoranesi on the way.
2) Bought talented replacements. Not flash-bang superstars Real Madrid would buy, but local, preferably Italian, hard workers. List includes Bonucci, Pepe, Krasic, etc.
3) Got the remaining replacements for free (e.g. loans of Marco Motta and Alberto Aquilani).
4) Finally settled the issue of Sebastian Giovinco: if he ain't gonna play, loan him away.

Rumors: Aquilani on Loan to Juventus?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 20, 2010, 8:18am PDT",,"Aquiliani's signing opens up a new set of issues…

Lets assume both him & Marchisio start,

Motta – Chiellini – Bonucci – De Ceglie
Krasic – Aquilani – Marchisio – Lanzafame
Diego
Amauri/Trez

This is unarguably our most creative line-up (Alex & Diego toggling). However, this lineup also lacks suitable defensive abilities. Marchisio is a good snatcher, but he is not an out & out DM to perform only defensive ability. Aquaman will move forward & he isnt a DM either. From the matches we have seen till now, our defenders are often out of position, I dont expect the wingers to drop back & help the defence ala Nedved. Fielding Aquilani & Marchisio would mean a lack of defensive screen. This formation will work nicely only if we play a flat back-4. Problem Motta often played as a wing-back & De Ceglie as LM, so it's difficult for both of these youngsters to stay in our own half for most of the match. Delneri needs to fix this. Last Chiellini often played as a sweeper, assisting the attackers (the goal against Sampdoria for eg), this season he needs to understand that we have enough creativity & he doesnt need to bomb forward.

The above formation with Tremoulinas/Bocchetti as a part of a flat back-4 will work like a charm.",Somnath ,"Aug 21, 2010 ", 5:44 AM,

Guess what can happen soon if we keep playing in this way.
The thing which bother me is not our signings cause we can't get the best team for a season but THE GAME PLAN AND TACTICS!
It can be seen that our team is very bad on the wings DEFENSiVLY.Nothing changed from the last season – too many spaces on counter attacks and then…goals!
GDN is may be a good coach but nothing is improved there – in Tim game against Inter we were torn apart from the flangs mainly because of our full backs positiong and defending. THIS KEEP GOING FOR ANOTHER SEASON AND GIVE US REAL HEADACHE ALREADY.
The main issue still remain the coach capability to transform his ideas in players heads – simply, look how Pepe looks in every game – running at the back but average upfrony. You can't be a classy coach without seeing this and take immediate action!
As regards of our attack we are the same shitt – Amauri is crap and do nothing! I can't uderstand GDN when he cry and shout that TREZ is impressive and keep the GURNAM man upfront.
I do hope that will start producing some team football and work together for bad and good like Nedved did it for us for a decade, but if the coach is stuborn we will do nothing and next year we will write the same about the team like now!",Jiji_pl ,"Aug 21, 2010 ", 9:19 AM,

I agree that the defence still looks porous, but keep in mind that it is still a new defence & will take a bit of time to gel. It also doesnt have the organizational capability of a Gianluigi Buffon at the back. Our defence will be better than last years, that is a certainity. Atleast the first choice line will be better.

The second goal was a very soft penalty for grabbing a players t-shirt in the box from a corner kick. It isn't at all vicious. This got me thinking that in Italy refs sometimes are too lenient, last year Diego got fouled left, right, and center, sometimes even viciously, but no ref had the guts to card the tackler. Hopefully the refs are instructed to cut down that kind of playing because it really hurts the championship, and we also learn but habits that might cost us dearly in Europe (I still think the foul is way to soft to be a penalty, but that is just me).",Jose ,"Aug 19, 2010 ", 3:16 PM,

During his time at our club Krasic was twice champion of Russia, a multiple winner of the Cup and the Super, winner of the UEFA Cup.
We will always remember a great game Milosz, who often delight us their flanking aisles, great passes, selflessness, and, of course, fantastic goals.

• Minus a few lapses here & there our defense is looking fairly solid, which comes as no surprise from a Del Neri team. Watch out for De Ceglie & Motta pushing up a tad excessively, leaving our flanks exposed. Thankfully Keyser Giorgio / Bonucci are keeping guard.
• Diego seems lost, Amauri needs to adjust his headers, Lanzafame / Pepe are getting good crosses in we need to exploit, but I wish we'd vary our offensive with more vertical passing as well. Expect ADP to pop in at some point or another in the 2nd half.",Marco P. ,"Aug 19, 2010 ", 5:56 PM,

- Storari was good enough, he might have had some errors but all in all he did save us a couple of times. Lets remember last year we might have had Nono Chimenti playing instead
- Bonucci and Chiellini are learning to play with each other and did a good job, the goal was not their fault
- Motta is a descent player, I don't know if he will ever become a great player but I guess he will do for this year. I still think Caceres would have been a better option (Hurry up Marotta and sign the Uruguayan)
- PDC is not fit to be our left back. That clearance at the end of the game was just embarrassing. He looked lost in defense. We need someone else
- Lanzaframe is good but he looked tired, he wasn't running at his usual pace
- Pepe is a workhorse, but one that does nothing memorable, a waste of space
- Melo/Sissoko need to learn to pass the ball
- Marchisio needs to recover his form, he is better than Melo and Sissoko put together but he is not back to what we know he can do, if he finds himself again our midfield is complete, if he doesn't we are dead because we can't do anything when we have the ball… To think Xabi Alonso could have been controlling our game (Thanks Secco)
- Amauri is a waste of space as well, he got a goal, woohoo… he should have gotten 3 or4 assists and 2 more goals. When the ball touches his feet the play ends
- Diego, trying hard, not much to show though
- ADP the only one that seemed to care to win the game
- Martinez… he had a nice run down the flank, if he can reproduce that consistently then we will be ok. Right now I am still deciding.",Jose ,"Aug 19, 2010 ", 6:59 PM,

Storari- Shaky. Didn't exactly inspire confidence.
Motta/PDC- Mediocre on defense, lots of hustle but not much productivity. Caceres is better than both of them.
Chiellini/Bonucci- Gelling nicely enough.
Sissoko- Good recovery, but as usual terrible passing, terrible giveaways.
Melo/Martinez- Totally anonymous when they came on.
Pepe- Same as we've always thought. A totally mediocre performance, very heavy first touch, poor passing/crossing, it either gets blocked or is 10 feet short and goes straight to the opposition.
Lanzafame- Continuing to impress. Lanzafame/Krasic should be starting.
Diego- Not a positive performance. Then again, look who he was up top with.
Amauri- Another garbage game, despite the goal. Doesn't make any runs, too slow, he simply does not anticipate play. ADP/Diego each had a nice final ball, Amauri stood there and watched it go by.

Swap in Krasic for Pepe, Trezeguet for Amauri, and get f***ing Barcelona on the phone and this team will drastically improve.

Also, saying it now. Sending Ekdal out on co-ownership was a mistake. Having sold Poulsen and loaned out Tiago, we're a bit light on central midfielders and Ekdal has passing skill, but isn't too weak defensively. He could have been a very, very welcome addition to our team.

And Trezeguet does do other things- 1st of all…he scores a hell of a lot more often. And second, he makes runs and such, which, alla Simone Perrotta pull markers off other players. Amauri just does not anticipate play at all, the only thing he does effectively is hold the ball up. But that's not enough. Case in point- Tonight, Melo (I think it was him) had a nice long pass on the ground to Del Piero who flipped it over the top (like this) and Amauri just stood there watching. I don't see him scoring this type of goal. 3 goals in 4 games is good though, but he's still not looking dangerous out there.

2) Amauri will sometimes need 1…2…3…4 good chances before slamming one in, although in fairness he only got 2 today, scoring 1.

Motta has good potential for improvement. He leaves defensive gaps in the back but his long-range crossing is getting better each game, and he's good at providing offensive options as well (plus the occasional long-range blast that's never too far off). Let's call him a Maicon-in-development.

De Ceglie on the other hand, seems to be very one-dimensional. His main attribute is his speed, which he often uses to get to the byline, beat his marker and get a cross in. Unfortunately, he does this without thinking, and without necessarily taking aim. Many of his crosses are gifted straight to the opposition. As for his defensive cover, it's almost non-existent (not as bad as Grosso, but awfully close).

I would say between Motta & De Ceglie, the one who currently deserves a starting position more is Motta.

Both are similar…though I think De Ceglie has a better cross. Motta's has often failed to beat the first man, I agree that sometimes PDC is too hasty, but otherwise his crossing is excellent. Can think of several of Amauri's best headers came from him. (Ajax, Lecce) I would rate them pretty close, and I still think PDC can be a good left-back.

And that was because his stamina allowed him to make 100-yard runs down the line equally well as he made 50-yard runs. So Lippi thought “what the hell… make him run an extra 50. Run, back-track, rinse & repeat. They guy can take it”. And he most definitely could.

De Ceglie is not a good left-back IMHO. He's an adequate wing-back, and a good left midfielder. While I am willing to put the rash crossing on account of his inexperience, his defensive skills need a lot of work on the other hand, especially if we wish to utilize him strictly in that position (and with Pepe, Krasic, Martinez, Lanzafame all competing for a side-midfielder spot, LB is pretty much the only option left for PdC this season). Right now, he's just inadequate but we're forced to start him for lack of better options.

Caceres can only play DC or DR, so we'd have to switch Motta to LB (which is a position Motta can, albeit less well cuz he's right-footed). But I think that ship has sailed and Barcelona don't seem to be accommodating, so let's stop crying over spilled milk.",Marco P. ,"Aug 20, 2010 ", 3:27 AM,

Barcelona are in financial crisis- should it come to the last hours of the mercato, I'm sure they will accept a loan move if we offer, just to lighten the salary burden. Like what we did with Tiago, for instance. There's no doubt in my mind he should be our #1 target right now, because of his versatility across the backline. You'll be happy to know we're linked with Antonelli, though if you don't want to see De Ceglie starting.

You missed the point about my Zambrotta mention. Yes, I know Zambro was a winger, and yes, I agree De Ceglie is not an optimal left-back at this time. My point about about Zambro was that fullbacks tend to mature rather late, Cassani and Balzaretti being two examples as well. Cassani started to emerge around 25, Balzaretti around 26/27. Certainly could be the case for De Ceglie as well. We know that offensive fullbacks can adapt and learn to play defense (Maicon, for example, who also matured from wingback to fullback around 26-27) however if one is a defensive player, it's hard to teach them in their mid 20s to play offense. (Molinaro and his ennesimo cross into the parking lot a fine example) De Ceglie, in my opinion, is about at the same level as Marco Motta, who I think is vastly overrated by many.

Europa League: SK Sturm Graz v. Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 19, 2010, 9:06am PDT",,"Uhm. Hope you're right about Caceres. He already knows the Juve milieu and his versatility would be a welcome addition.

As for your second point, there isn't really an unbreakable rule that says full-back = crap till he reaches 25. Everyone matures at their own pace. Chiellini was a pretty good LB before they turned him into a CB, and he achieved that level at a fairly young age. Back then his crosses weren't mind-blowing mind you, but his defensive work was already quite solid. Now even though he's turned into one of the best CBs in the world, it doesn't mean he couldn't have become the next Paolo Maldini.

And as for the concept that it's easier to teach an offensive FB to play defense than it is a defensive FB to attack, well… is tackling & positioning easier to learn than passing & crossing? Apples & oranges. Not sure about this one. In fact I would argue that in order of importance, a full-back's primary role is to hold a tight defense and only then participate in the offensive effort. That is, a full-back that can't cross he can still do his part for the team, for as long as the two wingers are good enough (e.g. Molinaro vs. Nedved). But if a FB's defending is bad, then you can't really expect the wingers to cover for him, hence overall his player rating is worse than a… Molinaro-type player. Just my opinion, and one probably shared by Del Neri who above all wants his teams to hold a tight defense…",Marco P. ,"Aug 20, 2010 ", 5:38 AM,

Seems pretty apparent to me…there's plenty of wingers converted into fullbacks, not too many defensive-minded fullbacks that ever become world-class fullbacks. Chiellini showed promise early, and as you mentioned was garbage offensively, but he's also an exception in general. Not too many players get 80 games or so under their belt by age 20, he's been marked as a star since a young age.

Of course there is no rule that it's 25-26, but much of the criticism of De Ceglie is exactly what I remember hearing of Cassani in Coppa games years ago. Then we just loaned/sold him out, he plays more, returns to Serie A at age 23, and matures into one of the best fullbacks in Serie A.

That completes our midfield, forget about a regista.

If Krasic or Elia come I am still hopeful for Caceres, he hasn't been linked to any club and I don't think Barcelona intends to use him so he might be our CB/LB signing. I doubt Tremoulinas would come. That football-italia article you are referring to says that the other players will come from exchanges and sells.

People think we hate Jermaine Jenas. Not true. In fact, we think he's an inspiration. He gives hope to all the other mediocre footballers – not bad, not good, just there – across the world, that they too can carve out a successful and of course lucrative career with the minimum of talent.

Bafflingly, the morning papers report that several clubs of some standing are elbowing each other out of the way in an attempt to sign the Spurs midfielder.

The Daily Mirror reports that Jenas is in fact 'set to sign' for Juventus on loan for the rest of the season, with a permanent move worth £10million – £10million! – should things go well.

And there's more. The Sun reckons Galatasaray 'head the chase' for Jenas, with Juve, Sampdoria and AC Milan grappling with each other behind the Turks.

Camoranesi's Agent is Officially a Moron,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:25pm PDT",,"In regards to reports linking us with Jermaine Jenas, he is an extremely average player. He was a promising player in his youth, but over the years injuries have taken their toll. He rarely makes the Spurs starting eleven. This would be another terrible signing if it were to come true. I'm shocked that we are being linked to a Spurs reserve player, how far have we fallen!

Im still baffled as to why we sold Edkal? Why not just keep him and thus not create the problem of having to sign another central midfielder?! This Juve side still has some problems that need to be resolved. We are still in need of a LB & CB for defensive cover. We now need to sign another CM and we still need a winger. Personally looking at the players we have been linked too recently, I hope we sign Ledesma, Krasic, Bocchetti and Barzagli. I think they are our most realistic options. Marotta has made some strange decisions over this transfer window, Giovinco and Edkal should have been retained for this coming season.

I'm a Diego fan and I can't help but think back to when we signed Zidane. He also struggled in his first season and the press got on his back, but we all know he went on to greatness. Diego has the look of a determined man this season, I think we will see a much stronger player this season. As much as I would love to have Dzeko, right now we don't need another forward. Unless we sell Iaquinta or Amauri (which isn't going to happen unfortunately) we have to stick with what we have.

Camoranesi's Agent is Officially a Moron,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:25pm PDT",,"Mass, I think we sold Ekdal because we are looking for a 4th CM, the starting pair will be Melo-Marchisio. Ekdal would not have gotten much playing time and we will not shield our defense in the way that Delneri likes. At his age he needs as much playing time as possible and his development also needs personal attention. Selling half of Ekdal means that Bologna has a vested interest in developing this youngster as they will get money in 1 or 2 years time. Us in exchange will get something closer to the finished product. I believe Ekdal can deputize for Marchisio in a couple of years.

Giovinco also wasn't going to find playing time and Parma is a good place for him to go, I just hope we don't get slaughtered when we try to bring him back. Based on the players we have on the wings: Lanzaframe, Pepe, and Martinez (if he is indeed a winger) then I guess Delneri wants somewhat of a physical players bombing up and down the field and Giovinco clearly doesn't have that. In one year or two he might bulk up enough to convince our coach otherwise.

I think we should offload Camo (3.5m salary) and Iaquinta so that we can close deals for Bochetti, Ledesma and Elia or Krasic. Actually after the goal that Diego scored in the Tim cup against Milan I think Krasic might be a better partner. In that goal Lanzaframe came super fast up the wing drawing one of the men marking Diego which gave the Brazilian just enough room to put it in.

Let's break down this Dzeko/Diego situation according to you:

-I agree that Diego is very talented and IMO he's our best offensive player we possess. You believe he can be replaced.
Who do you suggest we can purchase if we get rid of Diego and purchase Dzeko that can fill the void in movement, creativity and playmaking the Brazilian's departure would create?

I'm talking about the players we have been linked with over the last few months for whom we'd have somewhat of a chance of purchasing, not who you'd like to see Juve get.
Krasic and any other non-EU player would be automatically out of the question, Elia would require at least another 16 million if not more according to HSV, Bastos idem.

-Who from our current roster could do the above-mentioned?
—Pepe can run all day, has decent crossing and attacks space/makes runs fairly often. That's about it though, as he's a pretty limited player and at 27, he's not going to start learning new moves.
—Lanzafame is looking pretty good so far and he can do a bit of it all but can we count on him for 30, 40 games? He's still a pretty big question mark.
—Poor Martinez will probably suffer an identity crisis soon. Is he a RW? Is he a LW? Is he really a seconda punta? WTF was he really brought to Torino for?
—Camo? No.

-Who's going to supply Dzeko? Pretty much the same as above but a very important question.

-Who are we going to field as LB? I'd like us to spend as much needed in order to buy a reliable LB, preferably someone who can play both left and right too. If we dump all of our savings on Dzeko, we fix our attack for the next 5 years, while the LB situation will remain a mess. PDC is iffy on both ends of the pitch and he has Grosso as his backup…

-There are various methods of putting together a great team. There's the invest a ton of money and time on youth like Barca(unattainable for us ATM), there's the invest a ton of money on already affirmed stars like Man City(unattainable for us ATM) or there's the make a considerable investment and buy an important player for the squad each year, until you have a winning team(attainable and the most reasonable strategy for us ATM).

Last year we did just the latter with Diego. Due to various circumstances and previous fuckups, we found ourselves in need of purchasing a number of players ATM in order to fix numerous problems, which we have been doing throughout the whole summer(although not very well).
IMO, the best move, as Somnath said, would be to purchase Krasic this year, keep Diego and gun for Dzeko next season.",jorid22 ,"Aug 16, 2010 ", 4:57 PM,

Dzeko Does Nothing to Quiet Mercato Rumors,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:24am PDT",,"It's very simple. We need Diego. Selling him off, especially for only 16-17 million when he's worth twice that much in today's transfer market in my opinion, is an idiotic idea. He and Camoranesi are our most creative players, but Camo is too old and injury prone at this point, and is also being forced out the door. I think what we need to do is sell the dead weight that we REALLY dont need, such as Grosso, Grygera, Tiago, and Iaquinta (and possibly Zebina) to bring up our funds available, and then splash the cash on Ivan Rakitic and Marko Marin. Then wait until the winter, and see what happens. If Amauri can regain his unstoppable form from 2 years ago, then let him start. If not, start Trez until the winter and buy Dzeko. Same thing goes for De Ceglie. If he shines as our leftback, let him start. If not, buy Coentrao in the winter. Our squad could very easily look like this by the winter:

——————————-Buffon
———————Bonucci———Chiellini
Motta—————————————————Coentrao
——————-Marchisio———Sissoko
Lanzafame————————————————-Marin
———————————Diego
———————————Dzeko

Regarding Diego's loss/creativity, I think you are underestimating the impact of having a talent like Dzeko who can create for himself and finish at a much higher rate than any of our current strikers. How many chances did Amauri have in the TIM contest, many of which came from our current crop of wingers. The players you mentioned, Lanza/Pepe/Martinez, although not world class are still very capable attackers. Don't forget ADP too, and the midfielders, Marchisio & Melo. My point is we will not be able to replace Diego with one player, but rather with a cumulative effort from the players that we have/or get, along the improved finishing that Dzeko brings.

Also, the point of swapping Diego for Dzeko, instead of buying him straight up, is that we don't break the bank to acquire an elite striker. Spending only 10 mil means we still have money left over to bring in a LB or a winger (obviously not Krasic) or maybe both. I don't think bringing in Dzeko precludes us from making any other moves, save bringing in a nonEU player.

Furthermore, we don't know what going to happen next year and if Dzeko will be there for us. I see the opportunity now and I think it will improve our team, so lets go for it. Diego is great and in a perfect world I would bring in both, but the choice now seems to be one or the other, and I think our future is brighter with Dzeko.

Dzeko Does Nothing to Quiet Mercato Rumors,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:24am PDT",,"My guess is we have about 15-20m left (the money we are offering for Dzeko +5m), maybe even less. I think Marotta thought we were going to sell Tiago for 5m and that Zebina, Grosso, and Camo were going to bring an extra 2m + salaries. Salaries I think are the key to our market, first because we have to pay those on a weekly or monthly basis, transfers are sometimes paid over 2 or 3 years. Getting rid of Zebina, Tiago, Grosso and Camo would bring at least 7m if not more to our market (Thank Secco, once again) and the players we are targeting would have much lower salaries.

I read somewhere that Dzeko makes 2.5m, Zebina makes about that much if not more. Elia may probably come at a much lower salary, and so would Krasic. We are apparently after Bochetti who would probably make less than Grosso a year.

We got rid of Poulsen (high salary) and we are saving on Tiago's high salary, but that is a lot less than Marotta was expecting. I think until we agree on a couple more outgoing transfers there won't be much move in our market and there is where the Diego sell stands. With 15m – 20m we will be able to buy one between Krasic and Elia and we will have 5m left of a leftback, CB, and a regista. In other words, not enough money. If we sell Diego then we have 15m – 20m + 15 – 20m from Diego to a total fo 30 – 40m. With that we can buy one of Krasic or Elia, a decent leftback that might be able to back the CBs (Bochetti or Caceres) and an extra striker (obviously a promising one, not an established player).",Jose ,"Aug 16, 2010 ", 8:06 PM,

Dzeko Does Nothing to Quiet Mercato Rumors,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:24am PDT",,"Nice reply and I have to say your avatar is fucking awesome lol.

Now back to the actual post itself:

-I'm very well aware of Dzeko's ability. From the somewhat limited knowledge I have of him(I don't follow the Bundesliga on a regular basis but I have watched pretty much every Youtube video of him out there lol), he's a good striker with amazing potential. Can use both feet, great in the air, physically a freak etc etc. He's pretty much like a younger, Bosnian Drogba lol.

I'm also of no doubt that Dzeko is twice the player Amauri is and that he would contribute much more than a constantly hurt, 31 y.o Iaquinta could.
My main issue however, is that I still have doubts on how he would do in Serie A. A lot of people seem to think that ED9 will easily score truckloads of goals upon landing in Italy. The German league is competitive but he'd have to face a new country, a new league, tougher opponents, tougher defenders, tougher tactics, and he'd go from having the support of Grafite and Misimovic(both underrated players from what I've seen of them) to Amauri and Pepe…
Factor in his huge price-tag too and I can already imagine the Italian media labeling him a Bidone, “The new Darko Pancev” or some shit like that if he doesn't score a gazillion goals by winter break time…
Finally, add the above to us still having various holes in our roster, somewhat limited funds and being in a race against time(who here still thinks Beppe is going to land like 4 players in the next 2 weeks?) and I think you can understand my fears on this deal in general.

P.S: I think one's opinion on this matter has a lot to do with what you prefer/believe to be more important: defense or attack. Personally, I don't want to see any other moves before we finally fix our LB and 4th CB issues(not even the Krasic move), while some others might think an elite striker is what this team's missing.

P.P.S: If you can believe it, I have Dzeko playing as a lone striker in my FM10 Juve save and he is great ahaha. He is however, supported by Ribery, Di Maria, Diego, Giovinco and Gourcuff lol.",jorid22 ,"Aug 16, 2010 ", 8:23 PM,

Dzeko Does Nothing to Quiet Mercato Rumors,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:24am PDT",,"Nice discussion between you guys! I do agree with some part of both of you. The ideal answer would be to be able to get Dzeko and keep Diego but that almost impossible, even for Marotta. Losing Diego would mean that there really isn't any player that can draw in two or three opposition players and so create space for the wingers. Even though the Trofeo TIM doesn't mean anything, the two games showed how missed Diego would be. I do however believe that Juventus could make it without Diego given that there would be more talent and creativity along the flanks and a more lethal striker.

My answers for the missing players would be Dzeko, Insua and Abate.

Trading Diego for Dzeko would be key to getting the Bosnian.

Both Fiorentina and Genoa have been close to signing Insua for just €4.5m but failed because of his wage demands. Juventus should however be able to fulfill his demands. He is Argentinian but holds a Spanish passport and so would not take up the final non-EU spot.

Abate might sound like a strange choice but if the player can be convinced to leave Milan, I do believe that the club can be convinced to part with him for a small fee + 1-2 players. Given that Abate really is a winger but played as a right-central-midfielder or something he would fit a lot better in Juve's 4-4-2 than in Milan's three man midfield. Camoranesi on the other hand would fit into the Milan team's midfield. Milan are also missing a LB, and that where Grosso comes in. By giving Milan Camoranesi+Grosso+€5m Juventus gets rid of the players that have to go and Milan fills the positions that need filling. Win-win in other words;) I know it sounds crazy and far-fetched but I think Abate can give us the speed and quality we need along the right wing.",bullebulle ,"Aug 16, 2010 ", 9:28 PM,
Dzeko Does Nothing to Quiet Mercato Rumors,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 16, 2010, 8:24am PDT",,Really can't shed any light on that but IMO given that the loan deal expired and the now is registered with Barcelona again he would count as a non-EU player. What do you think of Insua? It was rumored that both Genoa and Fiorentina had agreed a €4.5m deal with Liverpool but that neither of the clubs were able to agree to his wage demands. €4.5m sounds like a good price and he his wage demands are probably half of what Grosso gets right now.,bullebulle ,"Aug 16, 2010 ", 9:36 PM,

Juve will announce shortly an agreement with Totenham Hotspur for a season long loan for Jermaine Jenas. The player will come at no fee and Juventus will have the right to purchase the player for a fixed price of 10 million anytime during the loan.

Not sure if it's bullshit but if even BBC mentioned it then I'd suppose there's something behind it. Would definitely come as a surprise and wouldn't be a terrible move IMO. He's like the English Candreva, would be the missing 4th CM and could come be used as a winger too.

Then i think we need to go for a top class striker, i personally would like us to buy Patrick Helmes or Dani Guiza, but if Amauri can prove his worth or Martinez does well up front, then we may not need a striker. Then we need a winger, and if we cant get Krasic, i would go for Marin. I would prefer Marin over Elija. Marin and Lanzafame on the wings, Marchisio and Rakitic/Sissoko in the center, and Diego supporting Helmes up front, that would be deadly. We also need a leftback, but in my opinion i think we should put some faith in De Ceglie until the winter, and if he does well, keep him as the starter.

Marotta speaks- “We are still in a delicate phase of the mercato, we need to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead. At the moment, I can only say that that we will do everything to better our level, and we will look to put the best players available for Delneri. Diego heading towards the Bundesliga?

Il tecnico, poi si sofferma sulla prestazione di Diego: “Diego in partenza? Noi non lo abbiamo mai considerato tale. Lui è al centro di una situazione di mercato che può evolversi in bene o in male. Ma lui sa che abbiamo grande fiducia in lui e l’importante è che lui dimostri di meritare di rimanere e che voglia rimanere. Certo è che se lui continua a giocare così è un giocatore che da la qualità che alla Juve in questo momento manca”.
With my poor Italian here is what I gather: Diego leaving? We haven’t considered such thing. He is in the center of a market situation that can develop for good or bad (whatever that means?). But he knows that we have confidence in him and it is important that he demonstrates that he deserves to stay here and that he wants to stay here. It is true that if he keeps playing like this he brings the quality that is lacking at Juve right now"".
I don’t think I am too far from what the actual text says (some stuff makes little sense to me). This is the first instance in a week in which someone in our staff has come and defended Diego. However Delneri says that they have been talking about the market and he is certainly being looked at.
Marotta’s declaration seems worse because he says that they will do what is best for Juventus. In terms of football keeping Diego will be the best thing for Juve. In terms of money, maybe an extra 20m after not qualifying to CL might be the best for Juve (I don’t agree).",Jose ,"Aug 13, 2010 ", 3:54 PM,

My take on this shitty little competition:
1)I hate to admit this because I like his work ethic and speed but Pepe has sucked pretty bad. If we are planning on using the wings for speed then he’s ok. BUT FOR FUCKS SAKE WHO IS TEACHING THESE GUYS HOW TO FINISH. DO THEY NOT TAKE SHOTS IN PRACTICE.
2) Amauri took that penalty like a little bitch. Why the hell didn’t he hit the ball harder. Again goes back to point made in #1.
3) WHat the hell was wrong with Del Piero today? One week, he steps up like a god and scores a fucking killer penalty from like a mile out and the next week?
4)Diego is our only true creative force at the moment.
5)Lanzafame is making me smile a lot lately.
6) I told you guys that grygera blows and we should also reinforce that right side as well. Inter owned us on the counter. We did well to gain posession with them and to fight for the ball, but they dismembered our left wing and the midfield. Sissoko looked like a real fool standing there WATCHING SNEIDER HIT THAT AMAZING SHOT.
7)Ronaldinho was allowed a lot of space for his goal too. Where the fuck was Motta and Bonucci?
8)PDC is making me smile too.

And then happens this: http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=105695873
Notice the huge gap in the midfield.
This is why coaches like Mourinho, Guardiola, Jorge Jesus, Ancelotti, always use a single defense midfielder, who must only make the following things: get the ball, one/two touches max, pass; get the ball, one, two, pass and so on (this what Ferrara should had told Melo to do and didn’t).
The only way this Del Neri experience can work, is how Juve apply pressing, and how high they will try to regain possession. That’s the key of it all IMO.

one thing i’m beginning to spot after reading your piece is that we’re currently rather low on player versatility. i mean we barely have players that would still be good enough when played out of their natural position. off the top of my head, i’d put Camo (birmingham move’s off, apparently), Brazzo (still with us, right?), Iaq, and perhaps PDC and Grosso into ‘versatile’ category, although i don’t see we’re ever gonna need the latter two promoted to left mid given the abundance of our natural wingers. We’ve all seen Marchisio’s performance would take a hit when he’s played at any pos other than cm, and i couldn’t even begin to imagine Diego playing on the flank, Zidane (Real Madrid one)-style. Of the players we’ve offloaded, Gio is capable of playing on left wing, 3/4, and seconda punta, while Poulsen was known to be decent when played as cb or right mid.
Is this because of Delneri’s perceived reluctance to be tactically adventurous, as you’ve stated, which in turn has made our acquisition this summer seemed to put versatility way down in consideration, or the other way round, i.e. poor squad versatility was an influencing factor to go with a tactically-rigid coach?
personally, i think versatility would give a little edge as our gameplan would be less predictable",hant00 ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 12:09 PM,

Melo is back and Diego is at least called up, we’ll see if he plays, I am sure if he does the media will try to interview him and ask him about his future. Tiago, Zebina, Camo, Grosso and Brazzo are off still. I hope Camo stays another season (high salary and all), the other ones I can care less. I hope Diego seems some field time, if he doesn’t then I think he will be on his way out.",Jose ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 12:56 PM,

keeping diego is absolutely the key, as if our opponnets decide to just stay in position and double cover their flanks, no chance in the world or not so worldclass wingers will be able to demolish a defensive stronghold, so then we’ll be needy depserately of players who can “spark” and surprise wit ha nice dribble or splitting pass( cough**giovinco** cough cough) if no diego this will simply never never happen",georg ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 2:35 PM,
Delneri's Juve: What is his vision?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 12, 2010, 10:39am PDT",,"Uhm… I’ve been thinking. If Del Neri privileges the prima vs. seconda punta association so much, what’s his alternative to Del Piero? And mind you, that’s assuming ADP is a starter which despite his age he still qualifies for, but he most definetely can’t be a starter in EVERY game. So when ADP’s not on the field, who’s there to replace him?
With all the Diego transfer rumours and Juve’s obvious market targets (i.e. Dzeko), methinks Del Neri is rather looking for two strong center-forwards up top, for instance an in-form Amauri or Iaquinta (with Trez as backup) and then Dzeko to complete the pair. I don’t think Iaquinta can be made to play second striker, and with Giovinco gone there’s no other SS than ADP on tap.
Which brings me down to another issue: even though he’s more of a midfielder, why couldn’t Diego be made to cover the same role Cassano did at Sampdoria and if yes, why is Juve so eager to let him go? Technically the two players’ abilities are somewhat equivalent (except Fantantonio is more used to playing up top than Diego), and Diego seems to really be the most valid alternative to Pinturicchio.",Marco P. ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 4:08 PM,

Delneri's Juve: What is his vision?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 12, 2010, 10:39am PDT",,"Marco P. I think Cassano is more of a forward than a midfielder, Diego is more of a midfielder than a forward. Diego can set up plays but he is not very good in front of goal, or at least he hasn’t shown that at Juve. That might be because he is a lousy attacker (doubtful given his record at Werder) or because he still needs to learn about Serie A and modify his game accordingly. Diego has some characteristics that are similar to Cassano but they are still very different players. I would say Cassano resembles ADP while Diego resembles Snejider (minus the awesome free kicks).
My fear is with all these sales (reducing salaries and all), the team is gearing up for another season without CL, or at least preparing for that prospect and buying players based on that idea. Next year we will loose Trez, ADP, and Camo (if we don’t loose him this year), those are all high earners in our team, I wouldn’t be surprised if after that we introduce a salary cap specially if we don’t make it to CL.",Jose ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 5:00 PM,

Hant00- I do like ZonalMarking, I’ve been reading it for a while, this is my first ZM-style post. :) Figure it’s very appropriate though, since Delneri sticks to his system, and that he’s got a solid history.
means there is no connection between defense and midfield
PDC and Motta can pass well enough, and Bonucci has displayed some impressive ball-playing skills, unlike Chiellini he could build up play from the back.
Marco- The idea is to make Diego a trequartista/seconda punta, moving him up closer. Formation will slightly change from an Atalanta-style trequartista/prima punta (Cristiano Doni/Floccari) to a Samp-style one, with prima punta/seconda punta. Diego will have to up his scoring though.
Pablo- I read that too. And it’s not very encouraging. I do think we’ll see two prima puntas up top occasionally, hopefully not as his preferred method.
Jose- I don’t think a salary cap is likely, even w/o CL. At least not an outright fixed line. Marotta is trimming a lot off the salary cap, but I imagine he’s doing it to make space for some bigger names next year.",agiamba ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 8:29 PM,

In a 4-4-1-1 with the wingers that we have currently, wouldn’t we have the same problems as last season? Lack of creativity. Neither of our CMs are registas, heck DMs cant even pass the ball. Lanzafame, Pepe, Martinez dont have enough quality. Camo is inconsistent. On a good day Camo can be the most creative player on the pitch, but those good days are rare now.

4-4-1-1/4-4-2 doesn’t really need an out-and-out-regista, and playing someone like Pirlo (no defense) burdens the other CM significantly. You do need someone who can pass alright in midfield, but he doesn’t have to be dedicated. Creativity comes from the wings, and it doesn’t have to be flashy. If Lanza can win a footrace and put a cross in, that’s good enough.
Wingers will pull defense off our strikers a bit, as well as Diego. It’s not a pretty formation, but it’s effective enough.

I think he was our best midfield passer, and we let him go. Now we are left with only 3 mid-fielders, only 1 is actually a decent passer.
 Further more, I go nuts every time I hear the word Dzeko. He is a great striker, BUT WE DON’T NEED HIM RIGHT NOW, I have been singing this for a long time. I was over the moon when we signed Bonucci and motta, but we still need another left-back. The main problem is the defence and midfield. We cannot start the season with 3 mid-fielders.
 All in all, we should NOT tamper with the attack, that can wait till next year, besides, goal scoring was not a problem last year, it was holding on to leads, so I really hope we bolster the defence and midfield in time.

Also, we can give him the farewell he deserves, he was no Nedved or ADP but he has been super class player. If he calms down he can be great on the right wing, better than Pepe and Martinez.
We have to swap Diego for Dzeko, no other way, 16, 18 or even 25m this late in the mercatto is useless, also we can’t wait to see if Samp is willing to sell Cassano. After that we can focus on the left defense and a center back, the we are done.
What I am seeing though is that Juve will sell Diego one way or another. I like that Schalke has gotten in this deal because it might force Uli’s hand to give us Dzeko, seeing that we would have no reason to sell to Wolfsburg unless they give us something we want.
The last thing we all should do trust the management. Moggi keeps saying that Diego is not suited for this league and clearly Marotta feels the same way. That is two top transfer directors agreeing.

Iaquinta or Olic (could be either, but you asked me who can be our Olic, well there you have it. About the same characteristics ’though Iaquinta is stroner in the air)

Scheinsteiger – Van Bommel, that’s where the gold is in their squad. Two very complete, gritty and experienced (while one still very young) players. Marchisio can be placed among them.

Although its important that the Italian teams do well in the European competitions this year, if Sampdoria goes out it might open up the possibilities of signing Cassano. Pazzini was earlier expected to sign but what Juventus really need (especially if Diego leaves) is Cassano. He seems to have grown up and would therefore be a great buy.
If on the other hand Sampdoria go through, I hope Juventus will put everything into signing Mesut Özil. He can play both as winger and behind the striker, perfect for the 4-4-2.",bulle ,"Aug 12, 2010 ", 4:02 AM,

Besides, a 4-4-2 (or 4-4-1-1 for what’s worth) is far more solid defensively on the flanks than whatever bizarre formation we played last season. That will help too.

I agree that Diego has some great skills, including his crosses and passing, but he just doesn’t shoot well enough to be a striker. And Serie A figured out how to slow him up by letting him wear himself out and shut him down in the 2nd half.
I really don’t understand the outrage about selling him(still).

The problem that I have is the state that our team will be at if this happens. Diego is our seconda punta, his substitute is ADP; we know that Alex can’t play 90 minutes week in and week out, so if we sell Diego we are left with I guess Martinez as a seconda punta. But I don’t see Martinez as a good SP either, and I thought we bought him as a winger (at least that is what he has played as in the last few weeks).
Gaetano, I would be all game on getting Cassano if we get rid of Diego, but Garrone (the Sampdoria president) is not too impressed with Juve stealing half his management, and I don’t know how content he will be with Marotta showing up with 18m for Cassano. I can’t think of another seconda punta we will be able to buy for the 16m we will get for Diego.
Diego, should and must be sold if we are trading up, but never to trade down (sorry Martinez).
What Marotta and GDN might be thinking is a Trez/Amauri partnership with Dzeko. I have not seen much of Dzeko but he might be more like Ibrahimovic, and the Trez-Ibra partnership worked well for us in 2006. That being said, our wingers at that time were Nedved and Camo, while our wingers next year will be Pepe and Lanzaframe, who are not at the level of the others.
If that happens then Bastos or Elia as a winger and Bochetti as a left back (and CB) and our market will be done.
Motta——-Bonnucci——-Chiellini——-PDC

We’ve sent Giovinco out on loan, we’re keeping Melo and Amauri, and now we’re being linked with a Diego sale. Do I think this is a smokescreen? Of course not.",Rinaldo ,"Aug 11, 2010 ", 12:14 PM,
"Hoping Against an ""Auf Wiedersehen"" for Diego",The Offside Juventus,"Aug 11, 2010, 8:30am PDT",,"I think Juve are selling Diego if and only if they get Dzeko as part of the deal. 16m this late in the transfer season would be hard to put to use. All teams with good players are counting on them and won’t sell them this late because they will have their own problems to solve. Atl. Madrid will NOT sell Aguero, and I don’t think Garrone will sell Cassano either, regardless of whether they make it to the CL or not. I also don’t think Cassano is desperate for a move. Dzeko wants a move and has been pretty adamant about it, Diego doesn’t want to leave Juve either but if his salary is increased to 6m then I can understand his father’s comments.
I think Hoeness met Marotta and offered 16-18m for Diego. Marotta said Diego + 15m for Dzeko, no other way, Hoeness said I have to think about it, will get back to you in 2 days.
The other thing that baffles me is this thing of Diego making 6m at Wolfsburg. I have been looking around and I believe Dzeko’s current salary is something close to 2.5m euros. How are they going to afford paying 6m for Diego?, is Diego that much better than Dzeko?, is he worth that much to Wolfsburg?. If this is in fact true then Dzeko will lower or salary budget which I think is something that Marotta is very much interested in doing.",Jose ,"Aug 11, 2010 ", 12:19 PM,

and Bayern Munchen did play some fantastic football last season: worst comparison ever. :P
Juve should be above every other club in Europe, bar Barcelona and Real Madrid. Don’t try to compare the incomparable.
Keep in note that our midfield is based on Felipe Melo, Sissoko and Marchisio. None of them can really pass a ball, except Marchisio and only when he is in a good mood.
Remember that despite playing in a 4-4-2, Capello had Patrick Vieira and Emerson, Nedved and Camoranesi, all of them technical players. Plus a great Del Piero and Ibra.
We have the above mentioned, plus Pepe. And Lanzafame. And that Martinez. It’s ridiculous, for Pete’s sake. There is no other way to face it.
No Marek Hamsik, no Javier Pastore, not even Ekdal or a Candreva. No, our core midfield is Melo and Sissoko. Power, brutality and fighting spirit. Fantastic and all very beautiful.

So true.
I was going to do a post on the Italy blog about this as well but, I think that this is a key problem also for Juventus.
Even Marchisio, who can pass the ball “when he is in the mood” is defense minded. Sissoko blows hot and cold. We’re going to get rid of poulsen as welll. Not sure what to think.

But, given that Dzeko is Marotta and Agnelli’s favorite wonderboy, I can see them doing anything to get Dzeko (even if it means Diego).
My hunch is Marotta & Del Neri told Diego he has 6-12 months to prove his worth and to prove he can adapt to Del Neri’s 442.
In the meantime, Marotta told Diego not to trust any of the bullshit in the papers (this summer) as he is merely using Diego as decoy to have meetings with Diets about Dzeko’s future transfer or Barzagli’s current.
How many of you think that buying Dzeko for a lot of money is exactly like what Secco did when he bought Melo & Diego for a lot of money to impress the fans and the world?
I think Marotta is a more savvy diretore than that and that he wouldn’t repeat that mistake. Del Neri’s system needs to start working before you insert a 40 million young striker in it with no wingers :)",Ivo ,"Aug 10, 2010 ", 7:46 PM,

I agree that Poulsen was more consistent than Melo last season. But the reason he was pushed out was because of his high wages. Plus his record in other leagues have always made him a preferred target for other clubs.
There’s no way we can recover what we paid for Melo, if we sell him now. We wont even get half. That is not good business. And lets be honest, we are all judging him on the basis of one bad season, who knows he might come good this season & play like he used to do in Viola.

Agreed. The worst part about it is the fact that it got implemented in the middle of the mercato window. That’s just stupid, and ruined a couple clubs plans. Like ours, and Lazio’s. Not saying we’d have bought both Dzeko and Krasic (doubtful) but certainly has caused us to consider that 1 spot more carefully.
why do we need barzagli? cant ariaudo fill the roll of 4th choice
Ariaudo is co-owned and spending the next season at Cagliari. We don’t “need” Barzagli specifically, but we do need a 4th CB. Given that Wolfsburg has no more use for Barzagli, might not be a bad option. My friend Adam suggests this meeting may have been about setting up a deal for Dzeko next summer, like Real did with Cristiano Ronaldo. Dzeko next summer would be great.
Alessio, you said if we sing Krasic the alternative forward would be Dzeko. What if we sing Dzeko, who do you think will be the alternative winger.
Hmm, to be honest I’m not sure. There has been mention of Elia and Bastos, but there doesn’t seem to be an real weight to those rumors. I definitely agree with you though, a strong defense is more important this summer than a top forward.

Re: Bocchetti, I have seen great progress from him since I first saw him play in the 2007 Toulon Tournament (where he was very shaky) to now (where he’s a senior international). I would be all for signing him (preferably on loan with an option), as he can not just fill the 4th CB spot, but he also gives us back-up at LB.

Marotta's Conundrum: Dzeko or Krasic?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 9, 2010, 1:40pm PDT",,"It’s better the get Krasic rather than Dzeko (unless we plan of Elia + Dzeko which is improbable). Dzeko is a tremendous talent, possibly better than Krasic & he is younger. In any normal circumstance, Dzeko (provided he comes in the range of 30-35 m E) will be a better investment.
But the current scenario in Juve is hardly normal. Last season we built a team to play to 4-3-1-2 & now we are trying to build one for a rigid 4-4-2. This utter mismatch puts players like Diego in a terrible position. We need wingers & quality ones too. Del Neri always focused on hardworking wingers. The wingers need to have both quality & fitness. So far, we dont have too much quality on wings. Lanzafame is still young & inexperienced. Pepe & Martinez are bit players at best, good subs, but not good enough to do well regularly. Camo & Seba are both out of the equation. Even Pasquato might be (or is he already?) loaned out.
So currently we have 3 strictly mediocre wingers in a system that demands good ones.
Last season scoring was not our problem. Defending was. I dont expect Del Neri to turn us into a bright & exciting side, I am expecting more of a well organized team who can keep clean sheets. Amauri, Trezeguet, Alex, Iaquinta & the rest can score 50-60 goals among themselves. Thats 10 from each of the four strikers, easily achievable. Even last season we scored 55 goals, despite all the injuries & off-forms. I expect Amauri to do better this season.
If we do get Dzeko, then the basic problem will still remain. Who will assist him? He has been backed up by quality players in both Wolfsburg & Bosnia NT. The current Juve team done have that many good distributors in the middle. Dzeko will need crosses, who will provide them? None of the 3 wingers are good enough to do it regularly.
In a 4-4-2 with Diego playing up the pitch, both of these guys will be starved off delivery. Even if it’s a 4-4-1-1 with Diego dropping deep, the same problem will be there. Remember last season ? 4-3-1-2 didnt work because the lone creator Diego was easily marked out of games. Same thing will happen in a 4-4-1-1 without good wingers.
If we get Krasic on the other hand, he will be a significant upgrade over the current bunch. Then Amauri will be able to latch onto miore crosses & Diego will have less pressure. From what I have seen of Krasic, he can cut back from the wings frequently. This will turn the system as a loose 4-3-3 when Krasic cuts back & assists Diego. Plus he is a decent goal threat too.
If we are bent og following a 4-4-2, Krasic is a better option.",Somnath ,"Aug 9, 2010 ", 9:34 PM,

Napoli took Cavani but it doesn’t change anything – they scored enough last year, so not a big deal.They are not consistent by the season.
Palermo didn’t do anything serious as usual , they want to compete for EU spot only , but i’m pretty sure thay will struggle a lot this season.
Samp are too much the same like last year, don’t expect anything serious from them even i’m sure they will crash in CL and we’ll get PAZZINI for 20 mln !
So in general, the situation is looking the same like last year – Inter, Roma, Milan and the rest including us.
BUT I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE MORE QUALITY THAN SAMP,GENOA AND PALERMO.OUR CONTENDERS FOR 4TH PLACE WILL BE NAPOLI AND MAY BE VIOLA (NEW COACH IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM).
As somebody mention above with a bit luck with our pockets we might get some fight for better spot but don’t expect titles in next 2 years.
I do believe that we must give credit to GDN and Marota for a year from now on doesn’t matter the results.
I don’t expect nice football from DelNeri first on the contrary, i expect ugly games and narrow wins but take some crucial point which we lost a lot in last 2-3 season.
One thing i’m pretty sure that if WE SALE DIEGO WE WILL MAKE COLOSAL MISTAKE! WE WILL MAKE OUR TEAM PRETTY MUCH DEPENDABLE FROM THE WINGS AND THAT WILL BE THA SAME LIKE LAST YEAR MARKING DIEGO IN NEW SYSTEM.WITH HIM IN OUR TEAM WE HAVE 2 TO 3 OTIONS TO REVERT IN THE GAMES.
Аs i saw in last 2 games we easily change our play when we attack in 4-2-3-1 with diego going back to pass around midfield and wings are pushing upfront and wait for his nice passses.Don’t fool yourself with this Dzeko story, we need good striker but right now we need good tactical approach and compactness more than him.

I also think Napoli & Fiorentina have a good enough squad to challenge us. Quags, Cavani, Lavezzi, Hamsik may very well turn out to be the most lethal striker-force this season. Viola suffered last season after the Mutu debacle, he was absolutely crucial in the 4-2-3-1. Mutu’s ban is about to end this Ocotber. By that time Jovetic will be back.

Marotta's Conundrum: Dzeko or Krasic?,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 9, 2010, 1:40pm PDT",,"I think Dzeko is a fantastic striker, one of the best in the world, but I have to agree that right now our priority is in reinforcing the defence and signing a decent winger. In relation to potential threats for the top four, I think Inter are far and away the best squad in Serie A. I can’t realistically see any team maintaining a consistent challenge for the scudetto throughout the forthcoming season. Inter’s squad is just too strong unfortunately. I think AC Milan will be galvanised by the appointment of Allegri and although their squad has generally stayed the same, I think this will push them to finish in the top four this coming season. I think Roma are an enigma this season. Ranieri is a solid coach and they have all the right ingredients to be Inter’s only realistic threat for the scudetto, but their is a big question mark over which Adriano they have signed. Will they get the goalscorer or the party animal, we will only find out once the season starts. I actually think Fiorentina may take sometime to find their optimum level. The loss of Prandelli will surely be felt throughout the club. Not to mention that Jovetic has been ruled out for 8 months, practically the entire season. I expect them to have a stronger season than last year as their is no distraction of European football, but I still think they will struggle early on. It may take some time for Mihajlovic to implement his tactics. I think Genoa are a genuine threat for the top four this season. They have had the best mercato of any side in Serie A. They have a very good coach and I fully expect the team to gel together quite quickly. Napoli will also be a threat, they have one of the most explosive attacks in the league. If Cavani can settle in quickly and Quagliarella finds some consistent form over the coming season then they will surely be a threat. They have perhaps one of the best midfielders in European football in Hamsik and they have a great coach in Mazzarri. I fully expect them to mount a challenge for the top four. One could be mistaken for thinking Palermo may struggle this season after the sales of Cavani and KJaer. But they are another team who have signed reasonably well. Munoz will replace Kjaer and the continued development of Hernandez and Pastore will surely give them goals. Not to mention they have signed Maccarone who is a steady performer in Serie A. Even Lazio will be a threat for the top six this season. The signing of Hernanes is one that I think will galvanise the team. They have signed some decent players and kept hold of the likes of Ledesma and Zarate. Udinese will also surely have a stronger season than last year. I fully expect Alexis Sanchez to have a breakout year. Plus they have held onto the likes of Inler and Zapata and re-signed players such as Candreva. I think they may be a side that pushes for the top six. I think the only side from last season who may struggle is Sampdoria. They have a new coach and a small squad that will surely be unable to cope with the league and European football, whether that be the Champions league or the Europa cup. Make no mistake this is going to be a tough but exciting season. Reports are suggesting that Diego may well be sold to Wolfsburg, perhaps this is one of the reasons why we signed Martinez, who can also play as a seconda punta. Personally I’m still baffled by the Giovinco deal!! Anyway I’m off to see Italy v Ivory Coast this evening, looking forward to seeing Cassano and Balotelli in the line up together.

We’re still working on some transfers that can change our squad in many ways. Two more additions will probably be made to the starting line-up. So it’s impossible for us to predict how the team will gel.
My personal opinion is that with some luck we can get us a second place finish, but the first weeks of the competition will be crucial. We need to start off on the right foot and strike fear in the hearts of our opponents.
Personally I’m all in favour of Krasic. Our wings need strengthening to take some pressure off Diego. Bastos would be another major signing, he’s a complete winger but it’s just another fairytale, just like the Dzeko story. Get it out of your heads, Dzeko won’t move before next summer.

My fear is buying a player who is 25 right now and in 2 or 3 years time (when we challenge for the scudetto) he will be 27 or 28 and will have 1 or 2 more years left in the tank, that is what we will get from Krasic. Elia, on the other hand will be 25 or 26 and will have an extra 3 or 4 more years of great form.
One of Krasic’s main attributes is his speed and that will decrease with age. Elia is more technical and in 3 years time will probably be faster than Krasic or at least as fast. We will also get him for cheaper.
This market has to be done thinking in qualifying to the CL but also in what we will have in the future. The younger the better. Elia for the midfield and someone like Bale or Bochetti and our defense and we will be set. That should not cost us any more than 30m we are planning to pay for Dzeko. We will also get to keep Diego, our main attacking threat right now (sorry Lanzaframe, Pepe, and Martinez).
I think Diego is a good player but I don’t think he is the new Zidane of our team. I think he slows down the game too much and the team really needs to play for him to get something meaningful. Don’t get me wrong, selling Diego this summer would be suicide because we will have to get a seconda punta (ADP won’t do for a full season) but I think we are putting too much emphasis on him. In my books he gets an extra year with the new team.

Amauri said something similar recently. That Italy is where he grew and developed as a footballer, so he chose the Azzurri because he’s very thankful to Italy for that. I guess I can live with that reason.
And I wrote this under the post about Molinaro, but I’ll say it again here:
I remember Prandelli saying that the call ups for the game against Ivory Coast were going to be heavily based on the fitness of the players. That I suppose would explain why Amauri is there since Juve started pre-season earlier than the other clubs. I’m just going to have to assume that Molinaro is there for a similar reason.
And while I don’t think Amauri is good enough to play for Italy, I do think this will help his career…and more importantly, Juve. Not only will it increase his market value as he is now an Italian international (so if we do eventually sell him, we can get more money), a lot of pressure will be taken off Amauri. He’ll no longer have every interviewer ask him about Italy and Brazil and have that constant pressure on him. It’s a big weight that’s been lifted off his shoulders.

That’s good to hear about Pazzini. I was worried he was left out because he didn’t have the best stint under Prandelli at Fiorentina.

Is that commitment in question if you were not “born” Italian? Will you not fight as hard in difficult situation? Perhaps. But remember every player has different levels of grinta regardless of his nationality. There can only be ONE Gattuso you know. :)

Trez cant even move anymore, he is soo heavy legged, it is unreal. Yes you can say he can finish, but lets be honest, can you really say trez is juves most important striker if he cant move. He is no where near the player he once was and its time for him to move on, just like raul did at real…
iaquinta always has his sick note out, claiming juve waged and disability benefits. He misses EVERY season through injury. Its time to offload him. Furthermore he is known to miss hatful of chances. 6goals in 40 caps for italy justifies this.
ADP, although being a ledgend, its time for him to move aside as he too isnt the player he once was. Therefore by process of elimination, amauri is juves number 1 striker! and that is no joke. He has been excellent in preseason AS I PREDICTED!!! MY SOURCES were correct, NOT AGIAMBAS!. And he looks very promising next season, which only means that juve should hold on to him. This is coupled with the fact that he has EARNED his Italian callup.
@Agiamba, how am i being childish? i think its the other way round dude…You totally contradict urself week after week. Last week you say you “are not actively opposing amauri” now this week, you say “we should dump amauri”. You are deliberatly trying to diss amauri, in an attempt to comeback at me with an insult, which truly is pathetic. Then you say amauri shouldnt play for italy, because he hasnt got italian incestry, which is completly racist. Because if he has earned and rightfully got his citizenship, why is it a thorn up your arse, if he is not italian…Look at how great PEPE and Deco are for portugal, despite being Brazilians. But they dont suffer the same extent of abuse, racism and victimisation as amauri…ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TELLING ME THAT AMAURI CANT PLAY FOR ITALY, BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL??!?!?!

I remember Prandelli saying that the call ups for the game against Ivory Coast were going to be heavily based on the fitness of the players. That I suppose would explain why Amauri is there since Juve started pre-season earlier than the other clubs. I’m just going to have to assume that Molinaro is there for a similar reason.
And while I don’t think Amauri is good enough to play for Italy, I do think this will help his career…and more importantly, Juve. Not only will it increase his market value as he is now an Italian international (so if we do eventually sell him, we can get more money), a lot of pressure will be taken off Amauri. He’ll no longer have every interviewer ask him about Italy and Brazil and have that constant pressure on him. It’s a big weight that’s been lifted off his shoulders. Maybe it’ll help him lift his game.
As for Prandelli’s other call ups, I’m surprised Gilardino isn’t there. I had a feeling Pazzini wouldn’t get an automatic call up though since his history with Prandelli isn’t the best. I have to assume though that both will be in Prandelli’s plans though. Cassano and Pazzini play great together at Samp. And Prandelli love Gila (even though I think he’s over rated).",Anthony ,"Aug 8, 2010 ", 9:15 PM,

Sad to see Ze German leave, but it had to happen. His attitude/fitness was getting worse with each season. He still has quality but at that kind of a salary, he is a liability. Same with Poulsen, I loved how he kept his head down & did pretty well last season. He was made to practice with Primavera & there was a banner – “Poulsen + cash = new striker” in the Cisco Roma warm-up game. But he was always in demand, because of his experience as well as his reputation in Spain & Germany.
Offloading these two players would be easier than offload JZ or Salihamidzic. These guys dont have the quality anymore, nor the fitness. Zebina was never good enough anyway, I was shocked to see AEK was interested in him.
Either way we will have offloaded Tiago, Poulsen, Molinaro, Camoranesi by the end of season. Any among Salihamidzic, Zebina, Grosso or Grygera will be a bonus. I wouldnt sell Melo, selling Poulsen means we are stuck with 2, very card prone DMs. We cant sell Sissoko/Melo & have just one DM left.",Somnath ,"Aug 8, 2010 ", 9:34 PM,

“Prandelli said that forwards Alberto Gilardino and Giampaolo Pazzini had only been left out of his first squad because he is already fully aware of their qualities having worked with them at Fiorentina.”
That’s good to hear about Pazzini. I was worried he was left out because he didn’t have the best stint under Prandelli at Fiorentina. And I’m going to assume that Molinaro was called up ahead of other more capable left backs because Prandelli wants to see first hand what he’s capable of.

Ranieri was brought in to save Parma mid-season and he calls Rossi, who shows up out of nowhere and almost single-handedly saves Parma from relegation, scoring 9 gols in 19 games during the end of the season. I thought for sure that with Ranieri moving to Juve he’d bring Rossi… but he didn’t. At that time Rossi was seen as “expensive” and “too much of a risk”, so at 20 years old he moved to Villareal for ~$10M. Instead of taking a chance on a promising youngster to grow in our team, he went to Spain.
I feel the same loss in this failure to bring Giovinco into the first team.

Giovinco's 1st Parma Interview,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 6, 2010, 9:14am PDT",,"No-one can argue with Prandelli’s selection I think. He introduced new faces from the start, and this is a clear signal to every player. Those who play regularly in good form will get the nod, even if they don’t play for Milan, Juve or Roma. And this attitude is absolutely understandable in my opinion. We all saw what happened in SA this year. The ‘stars’ who played at big clubs failed to deliver. So why not give a chance to those who play for smaller clubs?
The players who are called up will also have the hunger to achieve great things. They will have the fighting spirit, something that was really missing from most of the players this summer. The fresh faces like Antonini, Astori, Cassani, Lucchini, Molinaro, Lazzari, Amauri, Balotelli, Cassano and Rossi will be much motivated, and this will give strength to the Azzurri. Not only because they are great players who can do great things with hard work, determination and concentration, but also because these players are led by a great Coach who can create great team spirit, and also has the knowledge tactically. Prandelli knows how to build a competitive team.
So as an Azzurri fan, I have great expectations from the Prandelli era. Of course I know that the first several matches won’t be easy, but I’m sure all Italy supporters will be pleased with the team’s performance. In the near future I also wish to see Balzaretti, Santacroce, Cigarini and Giovinco. I hope they will do enough at club level to convince Prandelli to pick them.

Alex kicked that free kick like very few can, and if Alex rediscovers his form he might bench Diego. If either of those things explain Diego’s reaction I don’t think it is a bad thing.
Just because Diego came for 25m that doesn’t mean he should get to start. I think this was a wake up call for il Panda.

suppose fabregas is ON barcelona. lets just hypothetically say that last year, barcelona had the same finish we did, seventh place and god fucking miserable. now we all know that although fab would be delighted to be on barca, it would be the SAME situation as the spanish national team. hes very talented, but he is a surplus (hence why i have no idea barca want him so bad if they wont even play him). now what do you say to xavi, iniesta, and even messi when you take one of them out for fabregas, a player (HYPOTHETICALLY IN THIS SITUATION), who hasnt been able to prove himself thus isnt even a sure thing THUS IS NOT A DEFINITE ANSWER INTO CLIMBING BACK TO THE TOP OF LA LIGA.
last year, we purchased diego (assuming we thought he would be a treq), melo, etc. that means that if seba were to play, it would be after del piero and after diego. now playing above del piero isnt the problem. el capitan is aging and young fresher players will eventually move in. but diego was purchased for 25 million euro. and based on most of the articles written on this website, he didnt do a TERRIBLE job, he tried furvently to fit in and even harder to create chances. i know it wasnt his fault. so how do you gain popularity, fans, and confidence from your team by replacing a hard working and EXPENSIVE player like diego (the same case as iniesta or xavi) with gio (fabregas) who has yet to even prove himself? that is a risk that rigt now, a team that should be in the top two places, cannot take. gio may be talented and young, but he is a surplus on this team, he isnt a guaruntee, the more expensive and well known diego will always be chosen over him for both political and economical reasons, and it is unfair to him to leave him on the bench and unfair to us to risk another season with a POTENTIALLY (NOT SURELY), POTENTIALLY GOOD player",Antonio ,"Aug 5, 2010 ", 10:26 AM,

As agiamba said the left wing is right now our weakest point, Grosso and PDC are not Juve quality and one of those two is going to stay (if not both). Any new left back we get (or PDC) is going to need time to settle and I don’t think having Giovinco playing ahead of him will help matters. Can you see Maicon and Zanetti attacking our left wing with Gio and PDC?, we will get destroyed.
With this deal Gio gets playing time, Parma will play him because he is good and because they WILL make money if he shines. Juve gives him one year of experience while we settle the left back question in Turin. We also get to see how good he really is playing in an good team in Serie A. In Empoli he shone, but Empoli defended with 10 and attacked with Gio which might make him look better than he is.
This year we have Martinez, Pepe, Lanzaframe and maybe Krasic. Of those 4 only two will have long contracts (Martinez and Krasic). If Pepe and Lanzaframe don’t impress then we can get rid of them easily. Next year, if the GDN experiment is working we will buy 2 world class wingers, if Gio shines we have our left wing covered, if not, we will find someone new, same goes for the right wing. Krasic and Martinez will become substitutes unless they show something spectacular. That is how I see Juve being built, and this move means that if Gio is more impressive than Lanzaframe on the left we don’t have to go too far to find us our left wing.",Jose ,"Aug 5, 2010 ", 10:28 AM,

Fabregas made his debut for Arsenal at 16 & right now he’s 23. Xavi also made his debut for Barca at 18. And we all know the Messi story…
btw it could be argued that all those dudes are too short & frail… not strong enough to play football, defensive liabilities, etc…
At a young age they were given a chance to grow and mature with their club. They weren’t loaned out while their club was busy making pushes for CL or league title, they were blooded on the field and grew into the team.
It is always a risk to field unproven players. But if they have potential, and if they are able to realize that potential, then you have a player that has played with your club for a few years before even reaching his prime.
This is what we’re missing by loaning out Giovinco. We’re missing the chance to build a player around our team and at the same time build our team around a player. To lose this opportunity is the failure that makes me disappointed in Del Neri.",TeamGREASE ,"Aug 5, 2010 ", 10:55 AM,

He should be starting on the left wing, with Del Piero and Diego fighting it out for the central trequartista/support-striker’s spot.
This year is not a year to try new things, if anything is the worst year to try new players.
That’s exactly why we should have stuck with Giovinco instead of starting with Pepe/Martinez and Lanzafame.

Official: Giovinco to Parma,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 5, 2010, 8:38am PDT",,"Some thoughts:
1) I want to play against a team that would really test our defense. PDC and Motta look confident going forward (Motta more so) and Bonnucci (I think) had some sweet passes from the back to Lanzaframe. I want to play against a team that will make Bonnucci and Chiellini work together, I want to see Motta tackling in our own half and most importantly, I want to see if PDC can cut it as a Juve left back.
2) If our CBs didn’t see much action is because our team plays a compact game. Sissoko is back to his beastly self and Marchisio is doing alright. I think Marchisio is still depressed from the previous year. I hope he can go back to the levels he showed under Ranieri.
3) Unless Pepe improves he won’t be wearing the Juve black and white for more than a year. If Lanzaframe keeps playing the way he has then Martinez is going to have some tough competition (Giovinco watch out!!!). The work rate of Lanzaframe is pretty good, and his technique is good as well. He will NOT be the next Pavel Nedved but he can be a good player for us in the future.
4) Amauri needs to improve still, he is too static and made it easy for the Rovers defense to mark. If Amauri keeps playing this way he can be marked by the opposing team’s goalie. He didn’t do much to impress me. Diego likewise, he was anonymous. What I liked was that ADP came and in 20 minutes scored a great free kick. Hopefully that woke Diego up… his competition this year won’t be Giovinco, but Alex the great. If Diego doesn’t start performing at the top of his game consistently then he is going to see the bench often. Don’t get me wrong, I think ADP should play as a sub if Diego is in full form, but Diego can’t just show up to games and pretend he is on vacation, because Del Piero is still hungry.
5) Del Neri’s substitutions actually made sense. None of the take Del Piero out and bring in Poulsen (Ranieri), or Gio out for Tiago (Ferrara). Let’s hope he is still that confident when we are 1 goal down against some meaningful opposition (with all due respect to Rovers).
6) EL here we go, our odds at wining it are 14/1. Manchester City and Liverpool are ahead of us, we will see in May. I personally would like to win this tournament. I know it doesn’t matter much but to me it is more valuable than the Coppa Italia.",Jose ,"Aug 5, 2010 ", 1:47 PM,

Then one of Grygera of Brazzo have to go as well for 1 or 2m I think. Grosso is in the same boat as Tiago but I think he is more likely to leave than the Portuguese.

strengthen defense… which Marotta has done.
As I said in another post earlier. Our team’s problem last season was not scoring goals, it was not holding the lead in a game and not letting them score. This year we brought Motta and Bonnucci, both are promising young players. It seems we might buy another CB and a LB, the CB in mind will be a little old but he is meant to be a backup. The left back might be a promising youngster or a established older player.
That is what Secco should have done years ago. In 2006 we lost Cannavaro, Thuram, and Zambrotta. That is 3/4 of our back line, and I dare to say that is the best backline of the decade. Instead we got Chiellini (a Moggi signing), Andrade (injury prone), Knezevic (I cringe by typing his name), Mellberg… and others. Now, stop criticizing Marotta and the management, Dzeko would have been great is we had a team like in 06, but now would be a waste of money. As a matter of fact I think our interest in Dzeko forced CSKA to reconsider Krasic’s price.
As I said before, if we get a CB, a left back and a regista (this one is not that necessary) we are good. Most importantly, lets get rid of a CM, Grosso and Zebina first. We are well on our way to do this.
Krasic is not good enough?, Martinez is rubbish?, Pepe sucks?…
1) Krasic is not even ours and has never played in Del Neri’s system, let him play in a friendly before you judge.
2) Martinez might be rubbish but he has scored more goals than any of our midfielders in the last 3 years. He is not going to be a world class but Juve also had Zalayeta and Mutu who got us out of trouble once in a while.
3) Pepe is on loan, get over it, we needed depth and a hard working player. Pepe fits the bill.
I would have liked Dzeko, Schweinsteiger, Kolarov, and Vidic and I don’t think anyone here would have minded that but that was not going to happen, it has nothing to do with Marotta’s abilities and everything to do with our situation. Also, the players listed above became good by playing consistently in teams that are properly managed. Maybe in 3 years time we will be the envy of other clubs because Bonnucci, Motta, Ekdal, Marchisio and Immobile are destroying teams week in and week out. Trust in the management and give them time, we gave Gigli, Blanc and Secco 4 years, give this guys at least 3 to see where we are at.",agiamba ,"Aug 3, 2010 ", 10:30 AM,

So the thought that buying Dzeko won’t really help is BULLSHIT!
I don’t know about you guys but I damn sure observe the way mid/bottom table teams play against us and the way they play against inter. The biggest reason they’re scared of inter is not because of inter’s defense but their ruthless attack. Unlike us, inter have 2 (Eto’o & Milito) forwards with blistering pace and deadly accurate finishing whenever they get the opportunity. This is the reason so many teams play cautious and look scared to attack them until they’re already 2 goals behind.
Compare that to us and the way those small clubs attack us without fear of our slow strikers countering and scoring goals. Notice how our strikers is not feared anymore, they’re slow which don’t help our counter attack, they don’t hold up the ball well, they’re not that good with the ball at their feet (excluding Alex), they’re wasteful, and they don’t smell blood thus lack the killer instinct in front of goal. Small teams have no fear when they’re attacking us that is why our defense was always under constant bombardment.

Wingers add a new dimension, particularly wingers who score occasionally like Lanzafame and Martinez. I’m not satisfied with our strikeforce right now, but it’s functional enough.

Most goals conceded, more than Atalanta who got relegated, 16th worst in the league which is ABSURD. Our attack, with Amauri in legendarily-bad form, Iaquinta permanently injured, and Del Piero taking 1/2 a season to get in form, finished 7th. And only 5 goals behind the 3rd best attack.
For those who say we added quality in defense with Bonucci and Motta, that’s true. But our starters weren’t entirely the defensive problem, it was certainly down to our lack of depth/shitty reserves. We had 3 CBs last season, which is not enough, and led to us fielding Grygera-Zebina at CB against Fulham. That cannot happen again. We were lucky that Canna, Chiellini, and Legro were in fact relatively healthy and it only happened that one week, but we need a 4th CB. And we need at least one LB, preferably another RB as well.

In attack we need 4 or 5 (double the number of attackers), we have ADP, Trez, Iaquinta, Amauri, and Diego. I agree that they are old and some of them not good but they are all better in that position than Grygera is at RB.
As for Inter’s pacey attack. The reason why other teams play like that against Inter and not against us is because they know that pushing against such a strong defense and midfield will cause them more harm than good. In our case they can put 2 goals in our net for every 1 goal we can put past them so the investment of resources is worth it.

M29 posted this in the last article, a very good counter-point to the enthusiasm for Amauri.
Seriously, we have to stop this annoying urge to jump on the bandwagon everytime this or that players who sucked this past one or two season scores a goal or two. In a friendly. Or in a minor qualifying match against some (with all due respect) random-unknown-football-club from Ireland. Giving a second chance is fair and all, but when it’s done after said circumstances it becomes annoying. If any of you want to go this route, try doing it after 10-15 league matches or so.
I, for one, never liked Amauri, and with all due respect, looking it from all perspectives, I don’t think it will ever change. That being said, I never think he’s crap or shit (well, actually I’ve said that in one or two occassions, but it’s born out of frustration). In fact, technically speaking, I think he’s a better footballer than someone like Iaquinta for example. My problem with him is that, aside from his terrible inconsistencies, lack of movements (if any), poor decision making, and some other attributes close to these, he’s NOT a natural finisher.
Now that’s something to think about, no? Let’s see. He’s a prima punta/centre forward. Someone you’d expect to bangin’ the goals from all angles, with any means possible. Despite this, in his entire professional career, he never reached 16 goals or more per season. The closest he can get is 15, season 2007/2008 with Palermo.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amauri#Career_statistics
If you think that he can do it this season, think again. The guy is 30 years old. At this age, it’s very rare–if not impossible–for a footballer/athlete to reach his peak after years-years of dissapointment (or in Amauri’s case in Juve, one would argue, ""mediocrity"" in a very low competition environment against the likes of injury-plagued Trezeguet and Iaquinta).
With respect to Juve needs, right now, or at the very least, next season, we need a natural-born finisher. Badly. I don’t care if it is a poacher or a target man. There’s none of our prima puntas qualified for this bar Trezeguet, who is at the end of his career. Both Iaquinta and Amauri is 31 and 30, respectively. And to make it even more worst and depressing, prima puntas (preferably at the age of 20-25, of course) with a proven goal-scoring record is a rare bleed. They don’t produce this very often these days, when most talents that popped up is wingers/midfielders/seconda puntas.
So, do not bury the Hatchet, yet.
And may I add, come to think about it..after I saw the Shamrock backline that Jose listed there, many of them are actually not even professional, just part time players. Some of them were actually policeman, doctors, dentist, school teachers, etc. in their spare times (Got this info from some Hoops fans).",agiamba ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 4:04 PM,

They still cant compete with Inter and the back line is still very suspect. De Ceglie? Give me a break. This guy is not very good, and I dont think he ever will be. Marchisio is massively overrated and its as if the team is trying to make him the “next delpiero”. He’s not that good folks. Our strike force is not scary either, thats why Dzeko was key..And why has everyone made this Krasic out to be so great? No one ever really gets to see him and everyone talks like an expert about how great he is just because he looks like Nedved. And Amauri starting? Someone please tell me why someone like Amauri would start before Del Piero? And I really dont care how old he is because he’s still better than any striker we have. It says a lot about our best striker will be 36 in November. This is not good, compared to a team like Inter’s plethora of attackers, Rome’s too, we dont look so hot. Samp, Palermo and probably Napoli have better offences than us. We have our work cut out for us this year guys. The CL spot for next season is in no way a lock!

We need a new left back. Neither Grosso nor De Ceglie is good enough. We need wingers. I dont think Pepe or Lanzafame can take enough workload in a 4-4-2. Del Neri’s system focuses heavily on winger movement, so the players will get tired. I have been sceptical about the Martinez deal from the start & he hasnt done anything to prove otherwise.
I dont think Giovinco will fit in a rigid 4-4-2. He cannot/will not come back to defend, his crossing ability aint that great. These are basic requirements for a conventional winger. Seba will do very well in a 4-2-3-1 as an advanced winger. There’s no defensive duties in that role & he gets more space to run around. But Del Neri will never play a 4-2-3-1.
I beleive we still need Krasic as none of our existing wingers are good enough. Lets no count Camoranesi. His attitude is becoming worse with every season. For most games he will either be unfit or suspended. He still has quality, but is becoming more & more inconsistent.
So we are left with a 4-4-2 with ordinary wingers (till now), Krasic inst the next Nedved, lets get that clear. But he is better than the current crop of wingers. If we get Krasic we can still get a qulity LB. But if get Dzeko, that is the end of the mercato. And Dzeko wouldnt have any decent service either.

Getting rid of garbage isnt so easy, is it ? Poulsen is one of the highest paid players in Juvnetus. He gets paid some 3 m E/ year salary. There arent many clubs out there who will pay that much to a 30 yr old.
They got rid of Molinaro. They might get rid of Tiago. Almiron has been sold off. Other remaining garbage players – Zebina , who would even buy him ? He is injury prone, old & never was good anyway. Do we sell off both Grygera & Zebina ? Then keep Motta as lone RB ?
You need to realize most of the unrequired players are crap/old. Players like Salihamidzic will not get buyers easily.
Selling Iaquinta/Amauri was an obvious choice. But Iaquinta got injured just 2 weeks ago, he is supposed to be missing out for a few months. Keep in mind his injury record in last 2 seasons. Would you invest in a 31 year old, hardly prolific striker who has an injury record?
Amauri can be sold, but again his form wont get us buyers. And then what ? Do you expect Alex & Trez to perform for a whole season ? We cant expect Immobile or Paolucci to come to the party either.
If Giovinco is let go, it will be a shame. But he doesnt fit into a 4-4-2. And Del Neri wont change his system.
Caceres’ case was different. He cost around 9-10 m E. However good he has been in his first season, he is NOT worth that kind of money. Marotta did want to loan him for one more season, Barca wanted to sell him. And we cant complain about Caceres, we got Motta, who is probably a better allround player than him.
Martinez, Pepe are two signings that are mediocre. But look closely at the DEALS that he made, we are spending money in installments over 3 seasons, which means we are not spending too much in one season. Ordinary players, but good deals.

Have It Your Way,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 2, 2010, 10:55am PDT",,"juve 1897…Juve have a lot of areas to reinforce this mercato. The first thing that needed to be resolved was to ensure that Del Neri had the right players (and enough depth) to play his preferred tactics. Considering Juve’s funds are being stretched pretty thin, we can’t afford world class players in every position. The main goal is to build a solid base and tighten up the defense. That will help Juve finish in the top 4 so they can make the champions league.
Then next year we can start adding world class reinforcements to the team since we’ll presumably already have a solid base and the money to do it. And instead of having to sign 6 or 7 players next summer, we’ll hopefully only need 3.
As for the line up:
Storari (while Buffon is recovering)
Motta Bonucci Chiellini De Ceglie
Lanza Marchisio Poulsen Pepe
Diego
Trez
I’m assuming Giovinco and Camo will be gone. I think Lanzafame has a lot of potential too. He’s a different type of player than Giovinco, but still very promising. Let him get match fit before you judge him. I’m willing to give all our new signings a chance before I judge them. They can’t really be worse than signing Melo.

Have It Your Way,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 2, 2010, 10:55am PDT",,"I think we will have a difficult season, this team is still technically and tactically inferior to the likes of Inter, Roma and AC Milan. I can appreciate the signings of Bonucci and Motta, I think they have the potential to develop into great players. I can even understand the Storari signing, although I wasn’t fond of it at the time. But both the Pepe and Martinez signings are absolute trash. The only silver lining is that Pepe is on loan, hopefully the management will realise how poor he is and send him back to Udinese next summer. These two players are at best average, they do not deserve to be at a club the stature of Juventus. That’s what makes the Giovinco sale so baffling. I disagree that he doesn’t fit the rigid 4-4-2 system that Del Neri wants to play. He had some success in Ranieri’s 4-4-2 and has all the essential qualities to be a success. No one is saying that Gio will be the next Messi, but he is certainly a hell of a lot better than the crap we have signed this summer. The Krasic transfer is a little bizarre, I don’t understand his appeal. I’ve seen him play on a handful of occasions and I never thought he was particularly great. I think people here like him because of his determination to sign for Juve. But that shouldn’t cloud your judgement. He had a relatively poor world cup campaign and I personally feel that he is vastly overrated and overpriced. He is worth no more than €12 million euros. That’s not mention that we have already signed two natural right wingers this summer in Pepe and Martinez, if anything we should be looking to sign a left sided winger, which Krasic is not. I agree that this summer we don’t have the funds to just go and sign the likes of Dzeko, we need to reinvigorate the entire squad. I still feel we need a decent left back, Sakho is a great shout, he can play as both a central defender and a left back, he is highly rated and young. He has all the ingredients to develop into a great player. I still think we need a regista in the midfield, its a shame to see that Cigarini has gone on loan to Sevilla, another missed opportunity, although I have high hopes for Edkal. And yes we need another forward if possible, although pickings are slim out there. I think that unfortunately our summer transfer campaign has been blighted by our inability to sell. No clubs want to take on the massive wages that a good deal of our extremely average players such as Tiago, Poulsen and Amauri are currently on. I think this idea of not being able to play Del Piero, Diego or Gio together is a myth. This idea has been around in Italian football for many years. It’s a load of rubbish. Unfortunately I am pessimistic for the upcoming season, I think we will have a tough fight for fourth place. I’m glad we didn’t try to bring back Palladino, the guy is a terrible player! He rarely even makes the Genoa starting 11, so why should we bring him back to Juve. Let’s not forget that he is 26 years old and is no longer that kid with great potential. Some people have said that Lanzafame isn’t good enough but at least he is only 23, I’d prefer to give him an opportunity, at least their is a sufficient chance that he may develop into a good player.",Mass ,"Aug 3, 2010 ", 3:07 AM,

We need to change the mindset that Krasic is the next Nedved. Just consider him as a decent winger who is an upgrade over the current crop we have.
He did play pretty well for CSKA in UCL.
I am surprised that you think Seba will be a success in a 4-4-2, he started very few games under Ranieri & the best performance from him in a 4-4-2 was that little cameo against Chelsea.
Unless we have a world class LB, fielding Seba as a LW is hazardous. He wont/cant defend & the left side will be weakened.
In his youth career he mostly played as a secunda punta, but he cant do that in senior level.

As of the idea of signing new winger, after seeing the match against Shamrock, I think it is good to have Krasic in our disposal.
Del Neri asks his winger to work extra hard, contributing both defensively and offensively. Rotation I think is a must, hence, having 4 winger (assuming that Camo is otw out) is important.

In regards to Cigarini yes in fact he has been impressive in his short career. Admittedly it didn’t work out at Napoli last season, although lets not forget that he was Donadoni’s signing and not Mazzarri’s, but at Atalanta he was extremely impressive and was regarded as one of the most promising players in Serie A. The thing is we no longer have the financial ability to sign world class players, we need to go out and sign youngsters with great potential and develop them into world class players. Cigarini has potential, so does Giovinco. The likes of Pepe and Martinez are average players, they are both 27 years old, they will not develop into better players, they have reached their maximum potential. I agree Gio does need a more solid defender in the LB position. His defensive game is poor, but I want to see him stay for his offensive game which right now is far better than that of Pepe, Martinez and Krasic.

Everyone here agree Pepe & Martinez are ordinary players. Pepe is on loan & Martinez can very well be a backup (albeit an expensive one). Selling Seba will be a shame, but would he have gotten reular playing time under Del Neri ? Ciro at least made some statements of utilising him. Del neri has been quiet on him from the start. Seba is a wrong player in Juventus right now :(. Sad but true.
To groom youngsters into worldclass player you need a stable coaching system. Sadly, we havent had that since Calciopoli. We cant even properly groom our own kids, do you think we would have succeeded with Cigarini?

As I said in another post earlier. Our team’s problem last season was not scoring goals, it was not holding the lead in a game and not letting them score. This year we brought Motta and Bonnucci, both are promising young players. It seems we might buy another CB and a LB, the CB in mind will be a little old but he is meant to be a backup. The left back might be a promising youngster or a established older player.
That is what Secco should have done years ago. In 2006 we lost Cannavaro, Thuram, and Zambrotta. That is 3/4 of our back line, and I dare to say that is the best backline of the decade. Instead we got Chiellini (a Moggi signing), Andrade (injury prone), Knezevic (I cringe by typing his name), Mellberg… and others. Now, stop criticizing Marotta and the management, Dzeko would have been great is we had a team like in 06, but now would be a waste of money. As a matter of fact I think our interest in Dzeko forced CSKA to reconsider Krasic’s price.
As I said before, if we get a CB, a left back and a regista (this one is not that necessary) we are good. Most importantly, lets get rid of a CM, Grosso and Zebina first. We are well on our way to do this.
Krasic is not good enough?, Martinez is rubbish?, Pepe sucks?…
1) Krasic is not even ours and has never played in Del Neri’s system, let him play in a friendly before you judge.
2) Martinez might be rubbish but he has scored more goals than any of our midfielders in the last 3 years. He is not going to be a world class but Juve also had Zalayeta and Mutu who got us out of trouble once in a while.
3) Pepe is on loan, get over it, we needed depth and a hard working player. Pepe fits the bill.
I would have liked Dzeko, Schweinsteiger, Kolarov, and Vidic and I don’t think anyone here would have minded that but that was not going to happen, it has nothing to do with Marotta’s abilities and everything to do with our situation. Also, the players listed above became good by playing consistently in teams that are properly managed. Maybe in 3 years time we will be the envy of other clubs because Bonnucci, Motta, Ekdal, Marchisio and Immobile are destroying teams week in and week out.

I think Roma are the second best team in Italy but they have CL to worry about. Then Milan, Juve, Palermo, Napoli, and Fiorentina are on equal footing. I didn’t put Sampdoria in that list because they also have CL to worry about and I think they will be lucky to finish 10th last season, their team lacks the depth to play a European competition.
Next year Juve, Palermo, Fiorentina, Napoli, and Milan will be fighting for the other 2 CL spots. With the team we have I think it is going to be tough but doable to finish 3rd or 4th but it will require maximum effort.
Now, my team if the mercatto finished right now keeping in mind GDN will play 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 is:

The link up play between diego and amauri is excellent and they really are showing their brazilian flair. in all honesty, i think its time for adp to sit on the bench more often and allow new blood in, and new style of play from amauri and diego. As much as we all like adp, it is time to move on, and we cant be as reliant on him still after all these years, as we once were.
also as i predicted amauri’s midnight sessions are really paying off, and he is truly playin world class…however there is still a mood that another striker is needed…so why dont juve get miccoli, to pair up with amauri as their relationship is excellent. Both players love playing with eachother and its guaranteed goals, i suggest sell iaquinta to raise the funds for miccoli who is a lot less costly than dzeko (and also iaquinta eats on juve benefits anyway).
this will be ideal for juve as they have such a romantic relationship.

(Somehow the actual German generation of national players seems to have a problem with leaving mamma and all that :) It’s really hard to get them abroad. Strange if you compare them to the better German players in the 90s, of which most gathered some experiences in Italy or Spain.)
Amauri: under normal circumstances he should leave. He got about 100 chances to show what he’s got in the last season and failed about 99 times out of that. But 30 million for a player like Dzeko would have been the wrong investment anyway. Juve needs a strong defense and a dominant and creative midfield. Only after that one can talk about forwards.

But…who IS the “old Amauri”?
Three seasons at Chievo, played 89 games, scored a total of 17. That’s ONE goal per 5.2 matches.
Two seasons at Palermo, played 52 games, scored a total of 23. That’s ONE goal per 2.2 matches (which is not that bad).
And these were his peak years as an athlete, between the ages of 24-28.
At Juve, he has played in 62 games and scored 17 goals total. ONE goal per 3.6 games.
In other words, the man was always a decent-ish striker for small teams, never had greatness in him, and never deserved to have the Juventus jersey.
So he’s tall, he has long hair, some people find this guy attractive, and he scores a goal every now and then.
I’m trying to think of the money we spent on this definition of mediocrity, but how much are we going to make trying to sell him anyway? Real Madrid? Puh-lease. Mourinho would dig a grave in the center of the stadium and have himself buried in there before he plays someone like Amauri.
All in all, we have one expensive investment that has not performed well, and, looking at his past, is going to be unable to perform well (for Juve standards) this coming season, either. Am I going to be happy when he scores? Sure, it’s a Juve goal, anything that helps the team is great. Do I want him to fail? Of course not, same reason.
But am I going to bury the hatchet? No. Juve does not deserve mediocre players. That Juve striker jersey was worn by the likes of Sivori, Boniperti, Bettega, Paolo Rossi, Altobelli (mostly an Inter man, but a great, nonetheless), Ravanelli, and of course, Del Piero, among many other greats. Is Amauri in the same universe as these legends? What a disgrace.",juvealways ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 12:08 PM,

Burying the Hatchet with Amauri,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 1, 2010, 11:45am PDT",,"Exactly, Jose.
Seriously, we have to stop this annoying urge to jump on the bandwagon everytime this or that players who sucked this past one or two season scores a goal or two. In a friendly. Or in a minor qualifying match against some (with all due respect) random-unknown-football-club from Ireland. Giving a second chance is fair and all, but when it’s done after said circumstances it becomes annoying. If any of you want to go this route, try doing it after 10-15 league matches or so.
I, for one, never liked Amauri, and with all due respect, looking it from all perspectives, I don’t think it will ever change. That being said, I never think he’s crap or shit (well, actually I’ve said that in one or two occassions, but it’s born out of frustration). In fact, technically speaking, I think he’s a better footballer than someone like Iaquinta for example. My problem with him is that, aside from his terrible inconsistencies, lack of movements (if any), poor decision making, and some other attributes close to these, he’s NOT a natural finisher.
Now that’s something to think about, no? Let’s see. He’s a prima punta/centre forward. Someone you’d expect to bangin’ the goals from all angles, with any means possible. Despite this, in his entire professional career, he never reached 16 goals or more per season. The closest he can get is 15, season 2007/2008 with Palermo.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amauri#Career_statistics
If you think that he can do it this season, think again. The guy is 30 years old. At this age, it’s very rare—if not impossible—for a footballer/athlete to reach his peak after years-years of dissapointment (or in Amauri’s case in Juve, one would argue, “mediocrity” in a very low competition environment against the likes of injury-plagued Trezeguet and Iaquinta).
With respect to Juve needs, right now, or at the very least, next season, we need a natural-born finisher. Badly. I don’t care if it is a poacher or a target man. There’s none of our prima puntas qualified for this bar Trezeguet, who is at the end of his career. Both Iaquinta and Amauri is 31 and 30, respectively. And to make it even more worst and depressing, prima puntas (preferably at the age of 20-25, of course) with a proven goal-scoring record is a rare bleed. They don’t produce this very often these days, when most talents that popped up is wingers/midfielders/seconda puntas.
So, do not bury the Hatchet, yet.
And may I add, come to think about it..after I saw the Shamrock backline that Jose listed there, many of them are actually not even professional, just part time players. Some of them were actually policeman, doctors, dentist, school teachers, etc. in their spare times (Got this info from some Hoops fans).",M29 ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 12:27 PM,
Burying the Hatchet with Amauri,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 1, 2010, 11:45am PDT",,"cant beleive im reading this nonsense. this is coming from the same juve fans, when they played palermo 2 years ago, we’re cryin when amauri put 2 past the old lady, both brilliant strikes. And then having great calls for him to be signed.
the same fans that in his first 6 months, labelling him a world class striker, due to his fine form…Ok you can say amauri was poor last year, although i beleive that was due to extremely low confidence. He did not turn shit overnight, we all know he has natural ability.
Amauri had a bad year last season, but which juve player didnt?…diego cost £20 mill, and was shit, melo likewise…furthermore iaquinta is always injured gaining juve benefits, but never recieves the same heat as amauri, even tho at least amauri players football, not gettin the sick not out. Furthermore, even ADP was not great last year, his goal tally would be severly low, if he didnt take penalties.
You cant say amauri is shit because of last year, because frankly, every juve player was shit. But what we all know is amauri is a very gifted individual, players sexy samba football and his dribbling is purely exceptional. In essence, now that trez and adp are too old to play first team football, and iaquinta is on the sick note, this only means amauri is your most important striker. Do not see this as a negative, because he has bags of ability but has suffered from recent low confidence, now that his work ethic is back, i really do expect 20 plus goals this season, and for fans to really love him.

Burying the Hatchet with Amauri,The Offside Juventus,"Aug 1, 2010, 11:45am PDT",,"I agree with everything M29 has said above.
Amauri is not a “bad” player, he’s not a loser. But, this cannot be Juve’s only hope for scoring (Trez and ADP will still score here and there, but they’re past their prime, unfortunately. And Iaquinta is completely unreliable).
Players like Amauri do very well in small clubs with modest ambitions for various reasons. What works in Palermo does not necessarily work in Juve or a club of its caliber (not that there are any!). The fact that everyone had a bad season last year does not mean anything in analyzing Amauri’s performance. The guy has always, ALWAYS been a mediocre player. The numbers, in this case, do not lie.
I’m not sure we need a target man per se, but we definitely need someone with lethal finishing instinct, a natural ball striker, someone like Trez and ADP at their best six-seven years ago. You can have the best midfield and the best defense in the world, and it means nothing if you cannot finish.",juvealways ,"Aug 2, 2010 ", 3:58 PM,

Matchpost: Manchester City - Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 30, 2010, 9:52am PDT",,"My thoughts:

1) Chiellini is a beast
2) Melo makes this midfield look better (that's is what happens when you have a sports director like Marotta that thinks before buying).
3) Krasic was anonymous. He needs to help defend but he also needs to pass more. Sometimes he should take on his man but sometimes there are better options
4) PDC was good, not great or excellent but better than average. If you think the goal was his fault, I will say he should have had the striker but I think the goal was the fault of the midfield giving the passer of the ball all the time in the world. (Sissoko my eyes are on you right now).
5) Grygera played well. Motta better step it up.
6) First time in a long time when we held a result, last year, after the tying goal we would have conceded three more to get to our favourite score … 4 – 1.
7) Delneri knew what he wanted. He thought a tie was worth it given how the game was going and the opposition, and the Inter game on Sunday. I don't know if I would have put another striker and gone for the win. A tie in Manchester is enough for me
8) The boys are learning how to defend better. Besides the Palermo game we have always improved. Bari we were a mess, Sampdoria and Lech Poznan served to improve our attack, Udinese to improve our defense. Palermo we forgot how to attack and defend. Against Cagliari we played better but had some defensive errors and against Manchester City we held our own.
9) Martinez was not bad for a guy who has been injured the last month and who hasn't found his physical form since May (give him time).
10) Bring it on Inter

Matchpost: Manchester City - Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 30, 2010, 9:52am PDT",,"In genrel, i think last 2 game we improved as a group more than all the last season.

Good first 20 mins and last 15 mins, but in other time we were under pressure and manage to keep our feets down on the ground. POSITIVE.

Of course, there were some things for improvement:

1.Manninger – not on his best especially on crosses and corners. He looked uncertain a bit!

2. PDC – I saw a huge improvement this game for sure, but he must keep focusing on his orientation in some situations. Offside trap and long balls behind his back!. In general very good performance, apart of goal pass for MNC.

3.Grygera – I start believing he can deliever some good games if he keep this form – mainly in defensive games like this. Offensively he was not involed but not bad. He must be our starter on the right for now IMO.

4.CB- The pair was good most of the time .Giorgio is beast but i still have some marks for Bonnuci especially in keeping the ball too long in center sometimes. it can cause some mistakes!

5.Midfield – I heard many of you crying over Sissoko's play but i do think it was main reason GDN to put him starter and it was Crashing opposite play from the start which i think for 30-40 min worked.He took a lot of balls in midfield and didn't do as much lost ball as usual.

Marchiso for me disapeared for a long periods (just run after the ball)which gave us trouble in controling midfield.If only Some of these 3 can pass the ball accurate we will do nice things – as Marchisio did in first 20-25 min. Overal acceptable performance but don't forget MNC didn't give us so big pressure simply because they suck badly in there.

6.Wingers – Milos MTF Krasic is a bit predictable in some potions of the game. He is classy but need to look around sometimes and pass the ball not only to briblling around and to show how good he id. WE ALL KNOW HE IS GOOD! not that good game for him but he gave some help on the back.Martinez didn't make me impression so much but in first 30 min he was decent in the defensive plan.He is not ready yet but he is an option for sure. Pepe we all know…. In general left winger or back needs to push harder upfront for longer periods of the game.

7. Attack – ADP was given more defensive tasks from GDN IMO. he kept the ball ok but lost connection to Iaquinta mainly because of tracking back to help MOMO amd Marchisio. Iaquinta made good first half but in second he disapeared. Credit for the nice goal. I still believe he is better than Amauri as a option. WE NEED A YOUNG AND FAST FORWARD DEFINITELY – IF WE HAD ONE WE WILL SURELY SCORE AT LEAST 2 MORE GOALS LAST NIGHT.

8. GDN – he deserve credit for the group improvement display. last 2 games they play as a united group and we succeed. i do hope he can be more offensive sometimes but last night he did the right subs for me (in comparission with Mancini who fucked up MNC game).

Thank god we didn't take Mancini as a coach.

GDN can gives us more. GOOD WORK!

So, on suday we musn't expect miracles but we can expect some nice surprises.

A draw IMO will be the result but i still hope for something extra.

Chiello & Bonucci vs. Milito & Eto'o.
Eto'o is in form of his life so Chiello & Bonucci need to replicate and improve from the mcity's performance.

PDC/Grygera and Pepe vs. Maicon and Zanetti.
Scared the hell out of me.

Aquilani/Marchisio & Melo vs. Sneijder & Stankovic.
If Melo doesn't have his occasional brainfits, we'll be allright. Can't wait to see Aquilani shred the defense with his pinpoint passings, but my feeling says Marchisio will start and Aquilani will see some action in the 2nd half.

Krasic vs. Chivu/Santon.
Woohooo!!! Party time!!! There's a possibility Zanetti will be moved to the left midfield to help Chivu, though.

Amauri/Iaquinta & Quags/ADP vs Lucio (?) & Samuel.
It all depends on the quartet of midfield. If they manage to stretch Lucio and Samuel, we're in on an exciting match. If not, let's pray we can at least get a draw.

So all in all, it depends of our fearsome foursome. Can Krasic devour Chivu/Santon? Can Pepe help PDC contain Maicon? Can Melo make Sneijder his bitch?

Matchpost: Manchester City - Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 30, 2010, 9:52am PDT",,"I think we should play like this:



—————-Manninger

Motta—Bonucci—Chiellini—De Ceglie

Krasic—Marchisio—Sissoko—Pepe

———-Martinez

———————-Iaquinta



PDC & Pepe vs Zanetti & Maicon: Pepe and PDC have both been doing well lately, and De Ceglie smothered Johnson yesterday, so it's going to be very tough, but i think we can keep the Inter duo relatively quiet. Still though, i expect Maicon to leave our guys for dead on our left flank at least one time. He is probably the best fullback in the world, after all, so nothing to be ashamed of.



Eto'o and Milito vs Chiellini and Bonucci: I think we can handle them. It's very similar to the Man City game here. Tevez and Eto'o are both on red hot form, whereas Milito and Adebayor are not on their best form, but can still be dangerous, and we kept Ade and Tevez quiet, we completely shut them down, so i dont think Eto'o and Milito will give us many problems.



Krasic vs Chivu: This is where we're going to do alot of damage. Krasic has been on red hot form, scoring a hat trick last weekend and shouldve earned two penalties yesterday, even though they werent called. Chivu is pretty good, but Krasic is revealing himself as probably the best winger in Serie A. I see Krasic getting a goal and an assist.



Iaquinta and Martinez vs Samuel and Lucio: Lucio and Samuel are probably the best centerback pairing in the entire world, but Martinez has shone in the SS position which i why i think we should play him there and Iaquinta has been on red hot form. Not to mention the fact that if Lucio does indeed play, he's probably not going to be at full fitness. And with Krasic cutting in, providing crosses for these two, and overall tearing Chivu apart, i think Lucio and Samuel are in for a long night.



Marchisio and Melo/Sissoko vs Cambiasso and Sneijder: I think the Cambiasso-Marchisio war is going to be very good. Marchisio has a knack for performing at his very best for the big games and pulling out moments of brilliance (see his goal against Inter last year and his goal against Fiorentina two years ago), and overall this battle is going to be very good, with two of the best central midfielders in Serie A will be going at it. And Melo/Sissoko both have extremely good games against City, but i think Sissoko should be starting because he doesnt like to roam forward as much as Melo. Melo's actually very good at bombing forward, but we need to concentrate on taking Sneijder out of the game. Sissoko is better defensively in my opinion when it comes to breaking up play, and if he can revitalize his partnership with Marchisio from two seasons ago then they'll be set starters in the center of our midfield. Sneijder's great, and a candidate for the Ballon D'Or even, but i think if Sissoko concentrates and plays to his best like he did against City, Sneijder's gonna be shut down for the most part.



I see this going 3-1 to us. Krasic, Iaquinta, and Marchisio score, and Eto'o pulls one back for Inter.",Armando ,"Oct 1, 2010 ", 2:20 PM,

Juve aren't a team that are bankrolled by a rich owner like Inter, Milan or Man City, etc. Juve are a publicly traded company on the Milan Stock Exchange. They have certain responsibilities to the shareholders.

I think most fans would obviously prefer if Juve were winning trophies and they wouldn't care too much if they were in debt. But large amounts of debt sometimes come back to bite certain teams unless they are owned by the super rich. In the long term, less debt is always better…even taking the financial fair play rules out of the equation.

Just wanted to add, that though the Financial Fair Play rules don't technically come into effect until the 2013-14 season, they are going to start the monitoring period from the 2011-12 season (which is next year). And that just so happens to be the year that Juve will have their brand new stadium as well. That will help them increase their profits even more.

If you are in the USA and you order from the official JuveStore.com, you end up paying 97.5 Euros for a home shirt with the “free” name and number (no patch). The jersey itself is 75 E, but they charge you a whopping 22E for shipping.

If you order from the official USA store, JuveStoreUSA.com, you don't get any discounts but your shipping is way cheaper…and its all in dollars. So, you end up paying 105$ for a home jersey with the added name and number. The jersey is $80, the customization is $15, and the shipping is $10.

Hence, 97,5 E vs. $105 sounds cheaper right? Wraung, 97 euros is around $130 so you actually save $25 if you get it from the usa juve store if you're in the USA.

We will find out more from Vinovo in the 2 week international break – its selfish but I'm kind of hoping Prandelli doesn't call Pepe as this would give him 2 weeks of Sgt Slaughter drilling to make the change.

Our wingbacks worry me the most. Tevez loves to run and he will definitely be feasting on our hole between the midfield and defense, not to mention his thrust from the left wing position. Silva can alternate between wings and he has more than enough pace and skills to kill motta/rinaudo or/and grygera.

So it's still the same shit: the (occasional but costly) incompetence from the def midfield to cover the defense and the wingbacks.

On the other hand, if pepe-melo-marchisio-krasic can somehow dominate the midfield (and melo decides to plug the hole between mid and def and doesn't have his occasional brainfits), we'll be allright.",dwicarta ,"Sep 28, 2010 ", 6:29 AM,

As regards Man City, I think our main fear (like in other games) will be the defence. Leaking 9 goals in five games is no joke and, considering the calibre of players Man City will be fielding, there is some cause for alarm.

But then, Man City have not been really good in attack this season and most of their games have ended with them scoring only a goal or two the exception being the 3-0 victory over Liverpool. If we concede 1or 2 and score 3 or 4 we still win, right? :D. But then breaking city's defence should be a much tougher task then Cagliari's.

Watch any games from that season + Euro 2008 that summer (specifically the game against Spain), and that is plenty of proof how good Chiellini can be.

I agree that he isn't a defensive leader at the moment. I consider him a leader in the sense that he has a winning mentality and motivates the team….but he needs to start controlling that back line if he wants to be considered a defensive leader.",Anthony ,"Sep 29, 2010 ", 12:16 AM,

We are on the right track but we must be focused in the future.

My thoughts:

1. MTM – for it was FELIPE MELO! guy shows significant improvement, hugeeeee. I like him this season a lot, the only bad thing is his passing but he will improve i'm sure.

He fought for every ball all 90 min – bravo.

2.Aquilani – may be some of you we are gonna be disagreed with me but with him in midfield we look more unpredictable and classy. I like marchisio but Aquilani has something more than Marchisio and that's BRAIN! He's running in open spaces smart and nicely without giving impression he's busy but once he get the ball he did fast and accurate passes always on the right place. Also, he made at least 3-4 shots from long range, something which we didn't try in games!!!

3.Our right fullback will be main problem till we don't buy some decent player in Januaray – MR>RINAUDO looke very nervous and slow! he marked his opponent from 3-4 meters destance.NO WAY! I do believe that GRYGERA can be put on the right with PEPE on the left back- it will work, mark my words!

4. GRYGERA – i salute him for the displays recently. He deserves more credit in the future.He is not offensive enough but at least in defence he is ok “for now” which is more important than attacking.

5. Our wings showed last night that once they cover their areas in the back we are more compact and not leaking spaces so much – Krasic and Pepe track back, bravo. yes, it will cause some attacking restrictions sometimes but at least we will close spaces on the back

6. Attacking player – MAMA MIA….Iaquinta is good but not poacher! If TREZ was in his places last night he was gonna score at least 2 more goals! Iaqu is missing so much especially the 100% chances! no way. In regards of Amauri i was please to see him fighting so much,BRAVO. Yes , his first touch and dribbling are terrible but he gave a lot of troubles to Cagliary defence. WE NEED FIRST CLASS STRIKER FOR SURE! PAZZINI COME ON!

7.GDN – THE COACH DEFINITLY KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS AND WHAT WE MUST DO. HE NEEDS A SEASON TIME JUST TO PROVE US WRONG BUT WE'LL GIVE IT TO HIM.may be the subs are not adequate some time but acceptable.

GENERAL:

WE MUST BE WORRIED FOR MAN CITY GAME A LOT!!!

"Podcast: What Constitutes a Leader, Why Do We Keep Conceding, and the Upcoming Week From Hell",The Offside Juventus,"Sep 26, 2010, 10:49pm PDT",,"Here's the thing. Diego does better at Wolfsburg because he's surrounded by players that suit his characteristics. He didn't have that at Juve. At Wolfsburg he has Grafite and Dzeko in front of him. And he's supported by a midfield that actually knows how to play. At Juve he had Amauri in front of him. And behind him we played a 3 man midfield made up of players who can't play a 3 man midfield. Melo can only play as a DM in a 4-4-2. And the midfielders didn't have any creativity.

Diego was doomed from the start at Juve. And of course we can't blame Diego for not having the correct characteristics for our team. It was Secco's fault for bringing in a player who didn't suit the team. Secco would have needed to sign two quick strikers to play in front of him, two good fullbacks to make up for the lack of wingers in the 4-3-1-2 formation, and a regista to add more creativity to the midfield.

If he had built a team to suit Diego, then problem solved. There is no doubting Diego's quality. But the problem is that we would have needed to change the entire team to suit him. That wasn't going to happen any time soon. So either force him to play in a team that doesn't suit his characteristics, or sell him. I would have wanted to give him another year to see what he can do….but I understand why they sold him.",Anthony ,"Sep 27, 2010 ", 8:28 AM,

"Podcast: What Constitutes a Leader, Why Do We Keep Conceding, and the Upcoming Week From Hell",The Offside Juventus,"Sep 26, 2010, 10:49pm PDT",,"I think Martinez needs to start up front with Iaquinta, with Lanza and Krasic on the wings. Martinez is perfect for the seconda punta position for us. Good passing ability, can play as a trequartista/winger as well, but is also very good in the air and has good finishing abilities overall. We should play like this against City:



—————Manninger

Motta—Bonucci—Chiellini—De Ceglie

Krasic—Marchisio—Melo—Lanzafame

———Martinez—Iaquinta



Put ADP in at some time for Martinez, Pepe for Krasic, and Aquilani for Marchisio, this way to leave our three most important attacking outlets in my opinion healthy against Inter.



Then play the same way against Inter, though possibly Quagliarella might get a start, with Martinez on the left wing. Depends how Martinez does on the wing. If he doesnt do well, move him back up front, and take out Quags and put in Lanzafame, and then eventually take out Martinez and give ADP some time too.

"Podcast: What Constitutes a Leader, Why Do We Keep Conceding, and the Upcoming Week From Hell",The Offside Juventus,"Sep 26, 2010, 10:49pm PDT",,"From Football-Italia regarding the last match:

“However, the truest reflection of the match, and indeed Juve’s current climate, is that when Matri netted the second on 80 off the back of an exquisite Lazzari through-ball, Cagliari still believed until the final whistle that despite being two goals down and with an away record of eight points from the last possible 45, they could snatch something from the game. Re-establishing what it is for opponents to play Juventus could be the hardest task facing Del Neri.”

Many people have said that teams are not scared to play against us anymore. Letting Samp, Lech, Palermo, and Cagliari score a combined 11 goals is unacceptable. I am not saying that I rather loose 1-0 to all of these teams but tying against Samp 1-1 would have made me more comfortable than the 3-3 scoreline. Same goes for Palermo.

I think Delneri has done a great job to make us a high scoring side, but we need to be more compact. I want this Juve to win games 1-0 or 2-0. I am not complaining about winning, but we need to become that ruthless team that can comfortably hold a 1-0 lead for 80 minutes and if the other team dares to try to tie the match they will end up with more goals on their end.",Jose ,"Sep 27, 2010 ", 6:25 PM,

They play 3 holding mids which is kinda different, but the Yaya plays in an advanced role which he didn't used to do at Barca, but hey anyone at Barca can play in an advanced role if you play with such amazing attacking players in your side (Messi and co.)
But Milner and especially Johnson are two very talented players, the latter is really the future of England and Milner is a workhorse that tracks back a lot so Krasic can expect a tough time if he plays on the same side as Milner… It's gonna be tough boys, and I would be fine with a LOW SCORING draw xD",Chukwueku Akinyemi ,"Sep 27, 2010 ", 6:44 PM,

I have to say, our midfields of pepe-melo-aquilani-krasic looked very good… certainly much better with aquilani instead of marchisio… at least for today.

My half-time thoughts:

- Rinaudo is not a RB.
- Switch Grygera to RB, Pepe to LB
- Amauri doing work up top to hold up the ball, but not really get into finishing positions
- Chiellini/Bonucci relationship not syncing, still
- Cagliari exploiting spaces between fullbacks, CBs, no communication between them
- Aquilani/Melo doing alright up top.

Maybe a 10-15 mil move in january?? we need to splash on a fullback…motta and grygera at the same time are dreadful – one solid fullback addition would at least isolate an attack to one direction (in theory) – which is much more manageable than attacks from either flank that will leak.
Other than that..We will build and go forth..our italian youth are playing like they are 18-20 still b/c thats the italian mindset of holding back the youth…once players like marchisio, motta, bonucci, lanza and gio are like 25-27 they will be like the young spanish and germans (iniesta, cesc, ozil, kadiera etc) that are amazing now…our future is bright fellas and we just need to keep our expectations in check.",Drew DiPasquale ,"Sep 24, 2010 ", 9:03 PM,

On the other hand, although I can understand and even share to a certain degree your optimism for the bright near futures of Gio, Claudio we have to realize that time is running out, and it's running out fast.

If things keep going as they are, these guys will never truly fulfill their potential. If they keep on playing alongside shit or mediocre teammates such as Zebina(until a year ago), Tiago(until a year ago), Grygera, Paci, Pisano etc they are never going to grow.

Pretty much, we will never be able to tell exactly how good of players Bonucci and Marchisio could have been if year after year they will remain surrounded by the garbage for whom they often have to cover for on the pitch.

By next summer at the latest, we NEED to have finally purchased 2 quality fullbacks and 1 big time striker. It doesn't matter WHERE they're from, it doesn't matter HOW MUCH they cost, we NEED to make these investments ONCE AND FOR ALL.",jorid22 ,"Sep 24, 2010 ", 10:22 PM,

-Defense was too high,
-Offside trap doesn't even look as if it was attempted,
-Right about the 0:03 mark, as Palombo's foot is about to kick the ball, 4 of our players are still pushing up/not even looking back,
-Nicola Pozzi, Samp's main striker and the exact same fucking player who had scored in the first half and a teammate of his are completely forgotten by Pepe, who although at fault was the only one paying attention to them to begin with,
-Finally, when I was first taught the basics of tactics by a former coach, I was told that a flat 4 defense is never supposed to actually remain completely flat but somewhat diagonal in regards to the pitch. Palombo's pass originated from a pretty central position on the pitch. Except for 2 of our players (Pepe and someone else) who are to the left of Storari's left post, and another 1 who seems to be positioned in the center, EVERYBODY else has rushed up, to the right and in a straight fucking line.",jorid22 ,"Sep 24, 2010 ", 10:51 PM,

He's brought some good talent to Palermo, that's for sure. Marotta has done an even better job at Samp though. In fact, Palermo tried to bring in Marotta back in January (I'm assuming as a replacement for Sabatini since it wouldn't really make sense to have both).

Fabio Paratici is very good as well. Thankfully Juve were able to get him from Samp too. I'm quite glad we have Marotta and Paratici…not that I would object to Sabatini who has made good deals (mostly at Juve's expense). But Marotta and Paratici seem like the better choice.

#2. We didn't have enough money to go for both Bonucci AND Ranocchia.

#3. While Chiellini and Ranocchia would probably make a better partnership, Ranocchia's injury meant we had to go for the healthy one.

#4. Ranocchia was fully owned by Genoa. Bonucci was co-owned by Bari and Genoa. We were able to negotiate with Bari because they wanted to keep Almiron.

For me- (assuming Criscito stays as it appears likely)
#1- Federico Balzaretti. (9mil) Torino's going to Serie B (again) why not sign him? (again)
#2- Mattia Cassani. (7.5mil) Couldn't have predicted the future on him, but he'd be a hell lot better than Grygera/Zebina.
Two Turin-native fullbacks, both playing for Palermo. Goddamnit!

Potd: Grazie Secco,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 8:53pm PDT",,"Secco must be the biggest idiot of all time. He sold Balzaretti for peanuts after we got promoted from Serie B. Who did he replace him with? Molinaro. That sale did not make ANY sense. I suppose he thought Chiellini would be the starting LB? Who knows. Still dumb since Balzaretti was one of our better players and still young…exactly the type of player we needed to rebuild. Maybe he wanted to lower the salary cap you might be thinking. That would make sense if Balzaretti made more money than say….ZEBINA. Secco got rid of Balzaretti, but kept Zebina. Extremely stupid.

And Miccoli was sold for a ridiculously low price considering he was still quite young at the time. I'm not saying we needed to keep him, but we could have sold him for a decent price! What did we sell him for again? 4.3 million? For a player who was still 28 at the time and who just came off a very good stint at Benfica…..we should have got AT LEAST twice that amount. And when you consider what we paid for Amauri…..that price is even more insulting.

Cassani was sold when Juve were relegated because all co-ownership deals were eliminated (either brought back to Juve or sold) in order to help compensate for losses. It sucks that we sold him, but that wasn't entirely Secco's fault. I blame that on calciopoli as a whole. We probably would have kept him on co-ownership for a few more years if not for calciopoli, then we could have brought him back eventually.

And Nocerino, while I wasn't that crazy about him, is still probably better than Sissoko. Sissoko has better ball winning ability, but Nocerino doesn't give away the ball every time he touches it. Sure, Nocerino was valued at 7.5 million which was a decent price, but we used that to buy Amauri. AMAURI! And Nocerino's replacement (Sissoko) cost Juve what…11 million? So basically, Secco is incompetent. If we had kept Nocerino, we would have saved the difference in price of 7.5 million and 11 million (3.5 million) and we would have saved the money we paid for the disgrace of a footballer that is Amauri. Oh and we'd also still have full ownership of Lanzafame.

Potd: Grazie Secco,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 8:53pm PDT",,"Just finished watching the replay.

Motta just continues to give his opponents all the time in the world to decide what they want to do with the ball. He will literally be within a foot of the player, and just watch them play with the ball and not put in a tackle. He did that twice and both times they resulted in goals (with Pinilla on the 1st and Pastore on the 2nd). At least he did something right with the cross for Iaquinta's goal, but Jesus Christ mate, how hard is it to put in a bloody tackle when a player is right in front of you???

Whoever said Melo was poor is out of their mind. He was one of the best players for us tonight and has been one of our better players so far this season.

After another poor showing, I'm willing to bench Pepe and play Marchisio on the left with Aquilani in the middle with Melo. I thought Aquilani looked decent when he came on and will only get better with playing time.

Krasic was very good again. Using his pace and skill to beat players and putting in good crosses. His shooting needs vast improvement, but tonight the ball just didn't want to go in for him.

I don't at all understand the Del sub. He was our best player till he was hooked. And he definitely didn't look tired. So…wtf Delneri?

Quags was poor, as was Amauri. Iaquinta looked bright. Grygera was good as well.

I'm upset about the loss (this is Palermo's 3rd straight win in Turin! Wtf?) but not disheartened, as we didn't look like shit. We were pretty enterprising and that's at least something to hold on to. I just hope that Delneri beats the tar out of Motta in training tomorrow and eventually molds him into something resembling a competent defender. He can't be making the same mistakes over and over!

Potd: Grazie Secco,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 8:53pm PDT",,"I totally agree with you for all the thing you mentioned, especially Melo and Grygera mark!!!

Finally somebody to see that Melo is one of our best this season probably the best in midfield for which i salute him. Also Grugera prove me wrong and i do believe we can give him second chance before let him go – He can be starter but on the left is better for me cause we didn't suffer at all most of the game there, once we put him on the right will be the same.

And know my point – DON'T BLAME EXACTLY MOTA, GRYGERA OR WHOEVER ELSE IS NEXT!

WHY???

The answer is KRASIC!!! The guy didn't play defensive at all – i kept him on eye last games and i realeased that the problems are coming always from there because of space between him and mota (who no doubt is crap as defender) and cassano and pastore discovered all this spaces nicely.

As good coach GDN must see this and take appropriate action but it seems invisible yet.

I agree with most of you that Krasic is constant danger for the opposite but HE DON'T CONTRIBUTE LIKE PEPE AT THE BACK- this is the main reason why we conceed so many dangerous attack from Mota''s side.

And advice to GDN:

1.Once Jorge Martinez is back try PEPE as a right back and mark my words it will work!

2.Grygera and PDC as a winger will be decent option too.

3.MArchisio is very inconsistent – good games against weaker teams, against stronger invisible as usual- AQUILANI looks decent for the last part so he needs his spot in starters!

4.Kayser-Bonucci is not ready yet, they need some shake up!

I think he should be given only till Inter match. if we still have the problem, please sack him, because keeping faith is no good. we kept faith last season with Ferrara and then Zac, I still think that if we brought Guus Hiddink before that CL debacle we are still in CL.

Team building is essential – you cant win anything without that. The foundations of the Chelsea team was laid by Ranieri, on which Mourinho built the formidable machine that is still winning today. If you observe, the core team of Chelsea is nearly the same for the last 5-6 seasons. That stability was the reason why Guus Hiddink could turn around the fortunes of chelsea, and why ancelotti settled in so brilliantly.

Lets take a look at inter shall we – mancini was dismissed after winning the title, mourinho came in and even he was unsuccessful in the CL in his first year.

Team building, a period of stability is essential for a club to build a winning team – we had one of the best men to do it IMO with Ranieri. What fucked it up was the utter idiocy of Secco on the transfer front – i am curious to know how you define Secco's last mercato as successul.

Potd: Grazie Secco,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 8:53pm PDT",,"I think what you and everyone else needs to start doing is comparing our results in the fixtures last year with the results in the same fixtures this year. If you remember last season, we lost to Bari 3-0. I also remember us losing to Samp, Udinese and Palermo. This season we drew with Samp and beat Udinese (who only last year beat us 3-0). Compared to last year, our results have improved. Yes, not by much…but they have improved. And they will improve even more if you give this team some time.

And for the people claiming Diego would have given us a win against Palermo….why couldn't his presence last year give us a win against them in the same fixture? Diego isn't some magic player that equals victories when he's on the field. Yes, he's good…but he's no Messi. And he's hardly a prolific goal scorer. He only scored 5 goals last year if I'm not mistaken (none of which were scored in Torino by the way). I totally understand why Juve tried for Di Natale…because he would have been a relatively cheap option that would have guaranteed a certain amount of goals. It's unfortunate that he's so loyal to Udinese. Quagliarella can score a respectable amount too….but not as much. He is younger though, so he's at least a better investment in that respect.",Anthony ,"Sep 24, 2010 ", 1:46 PM,

Amauri was brilliant before he got injured and he will rise to the top again after his injury. MARK MY WORDS.

It was no coincidence that after amauri was substituted that italy ran out of ideas and offered no threat what so ever. The same applies to Juve. Amauri's intelligence as a footballer is underated. Only Del Neri can really appreciate his level of intelligence and pure samba finishing, while he has the strength and broadness of an military tank!

He will start against Man city and will do brilliant. His delicious locks of hair will swing side to side as he reaches for headers, or controls the ball on his chest. His thighs will show expansion as he sprints and dribbles past players. Whilst the amauri creature within him will be released and show his true passion for the game, when waving his arms and screaming at del piero.

It's not the fact that we lost today or that we succumbed once again to Palermo that I find enraging, it's the repetitive, ever-predictable way in which we seem to lose and simultaneously zero all of our previous efforts non fucking stop.

The team looked so disorganized… Palermo dominated most of the match, easily walking up through the midfield with quick passing (which we weren't able to stop) and quick runs (which we were barely able to defend). The problem lies in the midfield, where I thought we really had no presence and looked very slow and predictable moving with the ball. And we had ZERO counter attack.

I don't know how our boy does it, but after playing three 90 minutes games in one week Del Piero was still our best player… Must be immortal both literally and figuratively. Krasic did really well tonight and was unlucky to make the scoreline less embarrassing.

Awful performance by Melo (no defensive cover at all forcing Chiellini to push up really far) and Motta (as poor defensively as he was offensively).

I think the main fault falls to Del Neri though, as we looked completely unprepared. How many times did our own players run into each other making the same runs? How many times did Melo sit on his ass waiting for the ball? How many weak passes or useless crosses did we try? How many times is our opponent going to go box-to-box through our team on four passes?

We Really Suck,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 3:09pm PDT",,"lets all reminise of amauris brilliance. here ive collected a little piece from a previous post which will interest you all!



10 reasons to support amauri:

1. his hair are like beautiful locks swinging across his face everytime he scores and celebrates, giving him a warrior type image.

2. his facial hair gives makes him look like a tough guy with his own version of stone cold steve austins famous beard.

3. his body is a work of art and sculptured to perfection with his chest being as wide as a house, hence the amauri/chielline chest celebrations.

4. he has modelling contracts across the world and women love him. One even offered her services to Amauri for free, in hope that amauri would touch her, as he has the midas touch.

5. He has taken the number 11 shirt like a duck to water, and wears it better than former players like nedeved. whilst he is also currently juve’s most important striker ahead of iaquinta, ADP and Trez.

6. Amauri is better than iaquinta endof. as Iaquinta always sits on his arse on a hospital bed, picking up wages for doing nothing.

7. Amauri has great finishing ability, such was the case during palermo, and his first year at juve. The system most recently has not favoured him, but from inside sources, he has been the best player in training under del neri and will be lethal next season.

8. There are photos and videos of him naked on the net. Take a look, he is very large indeed. : heres the link -http://blog.stripperboyz.net/2008/08/amauri-carvalho-de-oliveira-naked.html?zx=42fd9e584fff6b90

9. its always great to sing amauri chants such as this:

AMAURRIII WHOOAAA

AMAURIII WHOAAAA

HE SCORES GOALS FOR FUN!!

HE FUCKS IAQUINTA IN THE BUM!!!

AMAURI WHOOOAAA

AMAURIII WHOAAAA

10. Also it is great to support amauri as you always feel as you are part of a community, in his recruitment agency. Supporting amauri is the way foward, and the fact that he is juve’s most important striker currently, suggests that it is time for us all to have great faith in Amauri’s ability as footballer and a sex god.","Gurnam ""bigman"" ","Sep 23, 2010 ", 9:37 PM,

We Really Suck,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 3:09pm PDT",,"My thoughts on the game:

We really do suck, like yeah wow these next 3 games comign up very important, and all tough, but yeah wow we really are no good.

I really want Jorge Martinez to be back, Pepe yet agan showed how crap he is really, how dd this guy get a call up to italy. Is there anyone as bad as him (except Molinaro.)

Where was Lanzafame?

Ballzaretti, I CANNOT believe we got rid of him and recalled Molianro, these craptacular past decision afre coming to bite us in the arse

Milos was good not great- no end product

Amauri was back, and did we know it. He was back to his whiny and bitchy ways. Welcome back CUNT.

Now that both Target men are back we need to start playing one of Quags/ADP and Iaqs/Whiny Bitch from the start. All those crooses today and we got head to one!

Motta you too really really do suck. I thought you were atleast good going forward- and you did give the assist, but soooo many times you ficked the ball forward- to NO ONE!

Palermo got cheap goals, and one good free kick. We deserved a fdraw atleast in my opinion. They really didn't outplay us.

Today really would have been a good day for a Diego Ribas to be playing and getting some through balls into the box, but i have to forget that know.

And fianlly again, we really really do suck",Sampath ,"Sep 24, 2010 ", 1:22 AM,

Correction…he already has. The only reason amauri was effective in preseason was diego. When I see Del P play week in week out I know how badly the management has worked in finding alternatives. How can a 36 year old player, no matter how great he is play week in week out. It may not be showing now but it will in the near future. He can't last a whole season carrying the team on his shoulders. Most teams are doing what they did to diego throughout last season. Cutting Krasic out. Because we have only one proper attacking source. Balza trapped Krasic throughout the game and he didn't give him the space that he got against udinese. It's too late to throw on aquilani and hope for another outlet. He should have been tested in the earlier games against bari and sampdoria. Why leave him on the bench and bring him on in spurts? He is way more talented than any player we have ever had in CM for the past 7 years and you leave him on the bench?! We could have kept diego brought in krasic, kept criscito, kept giovinco and brought in benzema, a player we could definitely have used. Does Marotta even know how useless motta was defensively to roma last season? He could have got so many better options like the REAL future of italy in de silvestri moved earlier for kjaer. I hate this bullshit about not having the funds. If wolfsburg have the funds to make massive transfers why can't we having such financially powerful owners? Why get in mediocre players like pepe and martinez? All this frustration because of a stupid fool in charge of transfers. He has given Delneri such a useless squad that he has to improvise at left back and up front. I know secco was a fool and responsible for the plight we had selling players, but marotta hasn't made things better. Yes he got rid of diego (class act), tiago (playing brilliantly at AM), poulsen (always did his job last season), camo and trez (club legends) and zebina (who is useless…so he got me there).

playing from the start with a goal down really killed us.

It's incredible how bad Juve is, they had few good chances near the end but Chiellini and Bonucci were exposed to Palermo's fast attack bcos their defensive midfielder Melo was usually out of his position imo, full backs were high, but not used very much (when they were used they scored) …simply they are bad, we should dismantle both Juve and Roma in next nine days when they are so fragile and throw them out of the race. It's a great chance for us (11pts more than Roma, 9pts more than Juve ), and resting Sneijder looks like a very good move now

Juventus v Palermo,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 23, 2010, 8:04am PDT",,"I said it when we beat Udinese and I will say it today. Let's not get too crazy with this game, Juve is a work in progress. Just because we beat Udinese it doesn't mean we are back, just like if he loose to Palermo it doesn't mean that we will fight for relegation.

Truth is Serie A is the most competitive calcio tournament out there. Palermo are a great team and they really play to our weaknesses. They are tall so crosses to the area were a waste, they are fast therefore some of our players can't catch up to them. See Marchisio's yellow card came from a player beating him in pace. They have amazing fullbacks (the best pair in the country I think). Balzaretti did not let Krasic get the best out of him and was always threatening Motta. Pepe and Grygera together could not stop Cassani. Also, Pastore embarrassed Bonucci in one ocassion.

All these things contributed to a horrific night. Where do we go from here:

- We need better fullbacks, Grygera will be gone next year, and I don't think Motta should NOT be purchased, he has had three games and seems more lost than when he started. I am still to be convince by PDC but we still need someone else on that wing. If we buy Balzaretti and Cassani or Schelotto we will be a much better team, no doubt about it. I don't care if we miss out on signing Dzeko, Lukaku, or even Maradonna, our priority has to be the fullbacks.

- If Krasic is closed down we are toast. Maybe if Martinez is all that we hope he is that will solve the problem as both players will need to be closed down and that will be a little tougher. With that being said I think stopping Krasic is easier said than done so I am not too worried yet. Balzaretti pulled it off but I doubt there are many left backs as talented as the ex-Juve player (makes me sad writing that).

- Melo is playing well, Marchisio not bad. But they need to help more in defense. I see these two not running very much and giving up too quickly. If they had the attitude of Chiellini, Krasic, Buffon, and Del Piero then we would be in much better shape, unfortunately, it is hard to teach attitude.

- Never ever play Quagliarella against a much taller team hoping he will latch on to a cross.

- Juve sucks won't help anyone here. Juve are not the team they were in 2006, we will not cause fear in our opponents for a while. The team needs a lot of work both on and off the field. That responsibility falls square on Delneri and Marotta. Delneri needs to make half of our squad believe that they are better than they actually are and Marotta needs to buy us actually good players, only then will we strike fear in our opposition.",Jose ,"Sep 23, 2010 ", 8:15 PM,

He has played well the last 2 Serie A games and is quite the workhorse. He might not contribute a ton up front but he runs for 3 and can help tracking back and covering for PDC/Grygera (who should get the start).

Martinez is just coming back from injury and I wouldn't want to give him a start in such a delicate game, when he's probably lacking in match fitness. I'm afraid that were Martinez to start tomorrow night, Cassani would have a field day on the left since El Malaka is probably still not at 100% and he's more of an attacking player than Pepe.

I have been seeing online a lot of happiness regarding the Udinese game and a lot of optimism ahead of the Palermo match. I am excited too but we need to be calm down, just because we beat Udinese it doesn't mean we are going to win the scudetto, just like if we loose to Palermo it won't mean we will be relegated. Udinese had a subpar performance and they hardly tested our fullbacks which we all know are our weak point. If I was coaching Palermo I would try to play wide as much as possible to force our wingers to be more defensive and to force and error from Grygera or Motta which we all know are more than common. I also have my doubts regarding the Chiellini/Bonucci partnership. Are they gelling? Yes, are they going to be able to stop Miccoli and Pastore? It is left to be seen, I really hope so.

Beating Palermo would give me more confidence in the future, we need to get on a winning streak to lift up the morale, and by that I mean more than 5 games playing solid. Last year when Zac took over and we won a couple of games we all thought we were back, we thought the second place was not far, and yet, we still finished 7th.

He's played for the Primavera already and says he's good to go. It's up to Delio Rossi to make the decision about whether or not he plays…or even makes the trip to Torino.

My guess is he'll be there, but not necessarily starting. Palermo need him pretty badly though.

3 games into the season n the new juve are in the privileged position of having experienced the full range of possible outcomes from a game (D1 L1 W1), i hope they've found the third outcome a most pleasant experience which they'd like to go through again sometime soon (howz about thursday night ?)

i saw palermo v inter n i was VERY impressed with palermo's play in the final third…very 'barcelona-esque' one-touch passing moves, tricks and flicks from pastore, ilicic and nocerino(who from what i saw on sunday would'nt be out of place in the barcelona side)…the fullbacks balzaretti & cassani also get forward to great effect with the latter particularly keen on driving into the 18 and cutting inside the opposing fullback…they should've gotten something from that game with a more deadly presence in the box than the unimpressive abel hernandez…

but i fancy our chances against them chiefly bcuz the centreback pairing of munoz & bovo did not look particularly indomitable, and sirigu (despite 1/2 great saves) looked uncertain in goal…

The Season Has Begun: Udinese 0-4 Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 20, 2010, 10:25am PDT",,"i think its really funny that iaquinta gets abused by the udinese fans. for 3 reasons:

1. His cheesy rat face is enough to piss you off. similar to ashley coles. hence he gets abused aswell

2. udinese fans are also obviously fans of the italy national team, and the fact that iaquinta played so shit, and in my opinion is entirely at fault for italys world cup, is also a valid reason why they hate him. His 7 goals in 50 caps is piss poor, it just goes to show how crap he is, and he displayed it to the rest of the world. Fans of italy are hardly going to give him a big well done, are they.

3. Fans abusing players is modern day football. so iaquinta needs to grow a pair of bollocks and accept it, rather than crying like a baby.



(p.s note how iaquintas ex club hate him so much, yet amauris ex club-palermo, still love amauri so much)



so the solution to the problem is thus. dont ever play iaquinta for juve, because otherwise he throws tantrums, and acts like a baby. and dont play iaquinta for italy. INSTEAD PLAY AMAURI WHO IS LOVED ALL OVER ITALY. FOR BOTH THE JUVE AND ITALY.

It seems that GDN is smart man and missing PDC (who is starter) he suppose to rely on GRYG on the right and guess it worked but you know why, SIMPLY BECAUSE PEPE WAS A HALF FULL BACK TODAY.

He was invisible exactly because of this and GDN orientated him exactly in this situation to be second left back having in mind that Udine may be is gonna attack there because of PDC missing.

Pepe did a good job today to cover whole left flang 90 mins.

Ive been keeping up to date with the scores lately aswell, and in all honesty juve have been shite, except today.

HE MISSED A SITTER IN THE EUROPA LEAGUE!..fuking diabolical, and waste of space, no wonder hes been kicked out of the azzuri, and amauri has come in.



However, it has come as good news that the one and only AMAURI CARVALHO DE OLIVIERA has made a speedy recovery and will soon be ready for selection, and will get minuites in the next match, so he can start the match against Man City, and rack up his 20goals a season, as paul the octupus predicted..Amauri will emerge from the corners of eastlands in his roman, trojan warrior outfit, ready to slay any vicitm that crosses his path. Roses shall be thrown from rooftops at his feet and wherever he walks. The mere sight of amauri's return in manchester will cause women all over the world to bow down before him in return for his pleasurable roman sword which will emerge through his grass skirt!!..however there is no soft centre in amauri. Within is a creature of mass destruction, which will cause kolo toure to shit in his pants, whilst yaya will wipe his shit for him..Amauri will sprint with his tree trunk thighs and finish goals like baggio whilst iaquinta will cry like a baby and accept it is more time he has to sit on the bench.

When your defense leaks goals left and right, you have a ticking time bomb as a CM partner and Amauri to pass the ball to upfront, not surprising if you seem below your best.

Aquilani is not fully fit yet IMO.

Martinez? No fucking idea. Still not sure what he was bought for, honestly.

Either way, I hope the players don't go on strike during week 5. Shit would be lame as fuck.",jorid22 ,"Sep 20, 2010 ", 1:33 AM,

Udinese's defending was crap, but 3 of 4 goals scored was good. Marchisio & Melo both are in form, which is a massive boost for the midfield. An in-form Marchisio will decrease the load on Melo, who will play better. For me Marchisio & Krasic will be the two mkost crucial player this season. Milos Krasic, take a bow. If he continues like this he WILL be the next Nedved. Bdw he reminds me more of Kanchelskis in his play-style that the Czech fury.



It's a shame that Melo will miss the game against Palermo. Sissoko can struggle against Pastore.



Good goal from Quagliarella, he doesnt have to be the next Baggio. Coming up & converting Krasic's assists are good enough. The team finally looks like developing a good understanding.



Good game overall, now a big test comes up, 3 of the next 4 games are tricky. Palermo, Cagliari, City & Inter.",Somnath ,"Sep 20, 2010 ", 1:56 AM,
PotD: That Felt Good,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 19, 2010, 10:04am PDT",,"According to espnsoccernet,'s Serie A schedule, our home debut against Doria last week recorded an attendance of 23949 people. The entire stadium itself, has a relatively small capacity of ~28000 people.
Just as a comparison, while playing at their home debut against Bari, Napoli's San Paolo had an attendance of just ~22000. The San Paolo's capacity is ~60200 people.
Fiorentina's home debut against Napoli on the other hand, saw about 25000 fans, while the Franchi's capacity is about 47300.

Just thought it was pretty interesting of a comparison, since Juve has been constantly criticized for never being able to fill its stadiums, especially the last decade or so.
There are of course other factors to take in consideration and this doesn't necessarily mean that we have better followers compared to other Serie A clubs but the numbers are certainly not bad IMO.",jorid22 ,"Sep 20, 2010 ", 2:08 AM,

Even better than last game's! Great setup by Krasic, he is really useful on that right wing. Today he even seemed too confident at times.

Solid tactics and subbing from Del Neri (finally) although I would've subbed Marchisio for Aquilani after 60' and given orders to Melo not to get sent off (if that is even possible). The yellow he got was solely based on his rep however – ref was shit overall.

No idea why Iaquinta was so mad at his former fans, maybe they were taunting him throughout the game, but he pulled an Adebayor there for no reason. Props to Quags for pulling him back.

Pepe turned out to be a good left back for most of the game (I was pleasantly surprised), and Del Neri's decision to not use a natural LB but a combo of Pepe & Grygera turned out to be the right risk to take.

Our backline still needs a lot of work and sync – offside traps and giving too much space still a problem. Nothing that can't be fixed, however, and am excited to see how the young Italian defenders will grow and learn.

I am off to pass out finally, but here is a picture that will warm everyone's heart fo'sho!

Whilst this season he has been outstanding in pre season busting his guts in training, doing 100yard sprints, and all kinds of body building. Rumour has it that he swims naked to even extend his penile muscles. MARK MY WORDS, THAT MAN IS AN ATHLETE!!!! I SAID ATHLETE!!!!! he is not your average joe!!!!!

Lets just all hope that he comes back as soon as possible, because he is a guaranteed goal scorer! Even agiamba admitted this during his “rebirth of amauri” post not too long ago. Whilst jorid also secretly loves amauri goals, and his delicious body sculpture, but can be too stubborn to admit it…It doesnt matter anyway jorid, AMAURI STILL LOVES YOU BACK!! he is the mother of juventus, and will breastfeed you untill you support him.
