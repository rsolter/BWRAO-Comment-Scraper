Plan for BWRAO Scraper

Min. Viable Product:
- Choose one page and find a way to load it into Python and parse it
- Solve for comments not loading with '#comments' suffix in URL
- Isolate the comments to get author, number of rec's execution_count
    - Author - inside of <span class="c-comments__date">
    - Rec count (if exists) - <span class="c-comments__rec-count">
    - A top-level comment - class="c-comments__comment"
    - Second-level comment - class="c-comments__comment c-comments_depth-1"
    - Second-level comment - class="c-comments__comment c-comments_depth-1 c-comments__recommended"
