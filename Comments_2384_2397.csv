While I only see Genoa on occasion, I saw the Genoa-Roma match last May. It was the day after my son’s birthday, and two weeks after his ACL surgery and I remember both of us commenting how good Sturaro was. Genoa won, 1 nil. I also saw him in the 1 nil loss vs Roma last December, when Perin got the red and Genoa went down to X – Sturaro held that midfield together, winning the ball and sliding in some very nice through balls. I have a deep appreciation for gritty midfielders, the engine of the team, and Sturaro has all the qualities I admire/respect.

I’ve heard these Gattuso comparisons too but for me Sturaro’s a more complete player than Gattuso – he looks better technically and has an attacking pacey side as well. He’s not just a bulldog. No disrespect to Gattuso who was king at what he did.

Real is in poor form and Atleti has shown everyone hw to destroy them, COUNTERS. I wont worry abt PSG much, their defense is a joke and cavani isnt in form and Zlatan is Zlatan + our def is very good against big, strong strikes its the speedy ones we hv problem with.

Real Madrid, I’m not really afraid of anymore, with this form + the fact that we could’ve won them last year, they seem to be ""beatable"" in a sense, unlike Bayern.
Obviously I’d prefer to play against Porto and Monaco the most, these matches will let us play our game and will have a relaxed atmosphere. I’m not underrating any of them though, each one of them had made impressive campaigns thus far.

Federico Mattiello expected to fully recover after gruesome leg injury,Danny Penza,"Mar 11, 2015, 4:06am PDT",,"I agree with everything except Atletico, Atletico played against us EXACTLY like we did against BVB. We had ZERO SHOTS ON TARGET! They contained Ronaldo + Benzema + Bale when they were in form. Only diff now n when we faced them previously is Morata, i dont think tht enuf.
Sides like RM, Barca, Porto and PSG will attack us if we give them possession and with a deep defensive line we can defend against them and counter against their weak defense. I dont believe our attack has reach the lvl tht can break down defense like atletico’s Maybe if we get lucky and if Matri/Llorente + pepe + coman is in top form so first can bully them and the other two can help with their pace.
Barring Monaco and Porto I am most confident against PSG their domestic form is woeful and I dont rate their coach as well. I felt Mourinho underestimated them + couldnt use their park bus tactic against 10 man. Their main strikers we can handle as all 3 main Cns of ours thrive against the strong Target man type striker, their defense has been VERY AWFUL if tevez + morata + pereyra perform like against BVB, lazio, parma, hellas and roma we will shred them apart. We hv enuf steel n creativity in mid to stand against any team in europe.

Juventus 1-0 Sassuolo: Paul Pogba at the rescue as Juve extend Serie A lead,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 9, 2015, 10:16pm PDT",,"Overall I agree with the ratings, but I would give half a point more to Chiellini and Lichtsteiner. Also, I don’t think Allegri actually made any mistake last night, the problem is that the team is always lacking focus when playing against the ""little"" at this point of the season. I also thought he made the right call sending in Pepe and Llorente, and although it didn’t work out as I expected (cross from Pepe for the head of Llorente and goal), it was nonetheless Pepe that served Pogba for the goal. The only thing Allegri needs to do is probably motivate the team more, but then again, it seems that at every match that matters (Borussia, Roma the first 70 minutes), Juventus is there, so…
It was reassuring to see Pogba coming back to shape. Not a perfect game, but he made some nice plays, and obviously that shot was awesome. On the other hand, I’m starting to think that Vidal is definitely lost, and that is not a good news. At this point, I don’t know if it’s worth betting on him for the next season (assuming he doesn’t make a comeback in the next few matches).
Anyway, now we need some heavy turnover against Palermo, and then be ready for Dortmund. In Sturaro, Barzagli, Coman, Llorente, maybe De Ceglie and Padoin; also try to give some rest to poor Marchisio (I know that without Marchisio, Pogba and Pirlo our midfield quality would drop drastically, but if there’s a game we can afford to lose this season, is probably the next one with Palermo, so I say go with it).",Overlord87 ,"Mar 10, 2015 ", 2:06 AM,
Juventus 1-0 Sassuolo: Paul Pogba at the rescue as Juve extend Serie A lead,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 9, 2015, 10:16pm PDT",Thoughts,"1) We had to really grind it out. For starters, absolute full marks to Sassuolo. Interesting fact, they started the game with 10 Italians on the pitch. They held their organization brilliantly throughout, fought well and with heart. Especially the forwards. Berardi and Zaza didn’t have a lot to do, no real chances fell their way, but man, they have some serious stamina and grinta to chase shadows for 90 minutes the way they do. Very encouraging.
2) Reassuringly, our defense seemed composed. A welcome change after recent games. More worryingly, another game where our midfield failed to click. Its been happening for a while now.. Pogba will have a stunner every now and then and Marchisio will be his usual suave self, but as a whole, just not clicking. Another complete no-show from Vidal. Its the sort of game we used to attribute to Marchisio.. Sure he was there, he didn’t do much wrong. Nowhere near his usual lofty standards. What is wrong with him? I thought Pogba (and hence, the team) woke up in the second half.
3) I’ll just go ahead and say it. Its been a pleasure to watch him and his spirit. He has a very unique set of skills… But the world will not end when Tevez leaves. One glaring weakness I see in his game, is his inability to really link up and get those around him involved. Sure, he’s thrived because of the system this year, but on days like this, the attack just didn’t flow. So clearly the problem isn’t strictly Llorente.
4) I thought Vrsaljko was the man of the match. Delivered in some dangerous crosses, linked up very well with Berardi, overlapped well, seems to be a competent passer.. But I knew all of that already. He looked like a beast in defense yesterday! Tevez’s low cross that Llorente bundled aside, we had no joy down our left flank and a lot of that was down to him. Another year with Sassuolo, and I think we should make a move for him. I’m sure I’ve heard a lot of reports about our interest before. Ideal to replace Licht (who had a poor game according to me.)
5) I think Berardi is ready.. More than anything, I don’t see him growing anymore over here and with these players, no offense to Sassuolo. He clocked his 50th Serie A game yesterday.. Impressive for his age. He did well not to react to some poor fouls from our players too. Bring him in. And I’d say it might be worth sending Coman on loan to them in return. Also, we should seriously consider offloading Llorente for Zaza. His grinta, stamina, strength and effort impress me. I think he’s ready for the step up too.
6) It was ugly at times, but we got the job done. I think securing a clean sheet was crucial. I do think it was a mistake to start Machisio-Vidal-Pogba AGAIN though… Pogba is suspended for palermo, but Marchisio needs rest and badly. Bit of a problem now with only Sturaro and Padoin on the bench. It will be interesting to see what approach Max takes.

Juventus 1-0 Sassuolo: Paul Pogba at the rescue as Juve extend Serie A lead,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 9, 2015, 10:16pm PDT",A few thoughts..,"Didn’t get the chance to comment on the game thread, my son had a game at the same time so I streamed it on my phone from the arena and missed a lot of it. Just rewatched the match in full, so a few comments:
LOVED seeing Nando sing ‘Juve, Storia di Grande Amore’ before the match. Say what you will about his form, few players have embraced the club and team culture like he has.
What is the deal with the Juve pitch? Did it rain in Torino last night? Chiellini slipped again 10’ like he did vs BVB, plus Evra, Zaza and Vrsaljko all lost their footing at one point.
Chiellini two more headers over the traversa, he consistently meets the ball but just can’t direct it down. Juve had 13 corners, and rarely seem to capitalize on them.
The Tevez/Morata tandem still needs time to evolve. At least twice Tevez slipped in a beautiful ball expecting him to make a run and Morata didn’t anticipate it. I thought Carlitos played a very strong match, and as much as I like Morata, can only imagine how good Tevez could be if he had an experienced, world class level striker to interact with on a regular basis.
Max pulled Morata and Pereyra and put in Nando and Pepe for some sort of 4-3-3 variation, with Pepe hugging the touchline but Carlitos rarely went left, it was almost more of a 4-3-1-2 with Tevez the 10 floating about with creative license? I couldn’t really discern what it was.
Speaking of Tevez, I’m almost finished with Alex Ferguson’s autobiography – he also remarked that Tevez is the type of player who needs to play every minute of single match to remain not only sharp, but content. The Berbatov acquisition was to the detriment of his career at United, Sir Alex acknowledged that, but interesting that he said what we’ve all noticed about Carlitos – he has the stamina and desire to play all the time, and is better for it. I for one think Juve will have an extremely difficult time replacing his work rate, grinta, and consistent/reliable productivity unless Juve makes a significant acquisition on the transfer market.
I still get the sense Berardi will remain at Sassuolo next year, but Zaza certainly seems ready for bianconero. Coman could perhaps take over the Sansone role in di Francesco’s 4-3-3.
So Pogba misses Palermo due to his studs up play with Vrsaljko, and he was still fuming about that card minutes afterwards – I thought was a sign of inexerienced temperment, only to see him haul in that ball from Pepe and deliver yet another Pogboom. Just when I think he is still lacking that final coat of polish, he puts one away and gives Juve all 3 points. Amazing instinct and composure for anyone, let alone a soon-to-be 22 yr old. Also post-match he gave his shirt to some middle-aged man with a big France flag, thought that was amusing for some reason.
When Barza came on for Carlitos, I stood up in my living room and gave Apache and no. 15 a big round of applause for his much-anticipated return to the pitch. Max then shifted to 3-5-2, but does anyone wonder if Barza’s return will alter the 4-3-1-2 and revert to a back three again??",Tre Stelline ,"Mar 10, 2015 ", 8:22 AM,

Pogba’s studs are just too high. Face level. Don’t get me wrong, he’s our favorite player, but still. Frankly, the ref did us a favor. Pogba will be rested and raring to go against Dortmund.
I’m impressed with Pepe. He’s providing creativity and hustle off the bench that we may have to call upon in Germany if we need an away goal late in the return match. Since his return, Pepe’s been a persistent threat from the right wing, more dangerous than any of our other options there.

I couldn’t really discern what it was.
Personally, I saw it as an asymmetric 4-4-2 with Pepe much wider than Pogba on the other side. Vidal dropped to his usual mid position and in fact played the last minutes much better than the rest of the game.
Ultimately, Vidal (tackle) and Pepe (lucky assist) initiated the Pobga goal action. It might not have been exactly what Allegri intended (Pepe attempted 5 crosses without success) but it worked.
Personal rant – Why does Juve always cross to Chiellini or Bonucci on corners instead of Llorente? I appreciate unpredictability but this does not make sense.

I don’t think so. I distinctly remeber Allegri declaring a back 4 was not possible without Barzagli. Of course he changed his mind then and it is possible he’ll do it again now.",Fefu ,"Mar 10, 2015 ", 9:24 AM,

You raise a great point, he did look reinvigorated didn’t he? Almost relaxed, less under pressure? I go back to the Sniejder talk back in January, BWRAO sentiment was probably 60/40 against getting him but I think if Beppe could’ve pulled off a sensibly priced move for him, it would have made the team so much better because Juve gets someone who is adept/experienced at the 3/4 to support the strikers but more importantly, Vidal goes back to being the box-to-box machine he is instead of trying to be something he’s not.

Hopefully marchiso gets rested against Palermo. Pogba will be sitting so maybe pereya and sturaro will play in midfield. But boys need to just gel a bit better.

Juventus 1-0 Sassuolo: Paul Pogba at the rescue as Juve extend Serie A lead,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 9, 2015, 10:16pm PDT",,"Choosing midfield against Palermo is going to be problematic. In a 4312, the left mid is always a bit wider to cover Evra. Both Pereyra and Sturaro prefer the right side of the pitch. I’m guessing Vidal can slot in their but it is definitely not his best position and he has not been playing up to his standards recently. I do not see Allegri moving Marchisio out of the deep-lying position to go left. Padoin is the only other option and I do not like that.
I Marchisio will be rested (against my expectations at least), then we are looking at Sturaro, Vidal, Padoin and Pereyra as trequartista. Not exactly reassuring which raises the next point:
I fear a 352 might be chosen against Palermo. The 3 mids would occupy a more central position in accordance with their preferred positions. Asamoah would have been the perfect backup for this game. Going out for the draw playing counter attack mostly would be wiser for a team with Pogba, Marchisio and Pirlo missing from midfield.",Fefu ,"Mar 10, 2015 ", 9:35 AM,

The second time, the team didn’t take its chances and was bounced. That’s it for the sample size.

Juventus defender Martin Cáceres to undergo surgery after injuring his left ankle,Danny Penza,"Mar 8, 2015, 2:10pm PDT",,"i define injury proneness as an innate characteristic on athlete’s body that makes him/her less durable, be it caused by genetics (i don’t have an example off the top of my head), less-than-optimal youth training regime that incurred a weakness in specific spot(s) (pato’s knee comes to mind), and/or less-than-perfect treatments for a one-off injury (pato again, and perhaps the original ronaldo)
i do think Caceres is physically robust, one evidence of which is his all-action playing style, hence i don’t think he’s injury prone as per my understanding above.
however, regarding my previous comment, i can see where there’s no difference at all when injury prone is just defined as ""so often injured""",hant00 ,"Mar 8, 2015 ", 5:23 PM,

Juventus 1-2 Fiorentina: Mohamed Salah's brace makes the difference,Tudor Tamas,"Mar 6, 2015, 12:16am PST",,"So, this is my first post here, so let me start with a general ‘hi’ to everyone.
Now, on to the game. Needless to say, it was an horrible horrible game. Juve played for like the first thirty minutes, then ten minutes more after taking the second goal. Apart from that, nothing. Confusion, disorder, lots of mistakes (which eventually costed us the game). From yesterday night I would save only Bonucci (the only certainty we had in defense yesterday) and Llorente (who finally scorde again). The rest was terrible. Our B defense (Ogbonna, Padoin, Caceres) is scary, in the sense that I will probably have nightmares about them. Marchisio played his worst game of the year, possibly ever (but he’s only human, hope Allegri gives him some rest), Coman was absolutely not up to the challenge, making lot of mistakes when passing the ball. The boy will have to play much better than that if he wants to get to the main team. Pereyra couldn’t score from two meters without a goalkeeper, I think (apart from that, he’s good, but he will have to start scoring at some point or it’s better if we find someone else). And finally, Allegri made an absolute mess of the game.
I think we can agree that the 4-3-3 is currently not an option (except maybe against teams like Verona or Atalanta or whatever). I’m not saying we could not play like that in the future, I actually like it better than the 4-3-1-2, but the team should devolve some serious effort to it, and it cannot be done in a crucial point of the season. Fiorentina is not a team to be underestimated, as they clearly showed last night, and we should have sticked with the usual plan.
Anyway, we are probably 90% out of Coppa Italia at the moment. Fiorentina is really in good shape right now, and I don’t see them losing with a 2 goal difference at the Franchi. We could do it, if we really wanted it, but then to really want it we should probably be eliminated from Champions at the next game, and I honestly prefer to win against Borussia and then go out of Coppa Italia.
Still, there are a couple of good things to take from this loss.
1) We needed some serious shaking up. Apart from the game with Borussia, we have not been playing well for the last couple of months. Last season Juve started his record-run to the scudetto after the 2-4 at Franchi, I hope this home loss can work the same way.
2) The game clearly showed at least a couple of things we need to fix during the summer market. First, our second lines in defense are not the level they should be. They worked decently so far, but if we want to really fight for two or three titles every year, they will have to go and be replaced. Rugani is a good start, but we need one or two more fixes, possibly relatively young (maybe around 25 years old, it’s a good age for a defender) so they can stay for a few years. Second, we need a new regista to take the place of Pirlo. He is getting old and cannot play with continuity, but without him we often suffer from a lack of order and ideas.",Overlord87 ,"Mar 6, 2015 ", 1:16 AM,

Now with the England inflation as well as the possibility of a bidding war there’s always the chance we could get that 40 mil for him, I don’t think it’s something that can be relied no if we stick him on the market.
We pick up a quality attacking mid or a winger and arturo is perminately back in his favored position. I think he needs one more year with us before we try and sell him.

You do however make a good argument for his sale. At 27 (going on 28) and with two years left on his contract, his value probably be at it’s highest this summer. Although, since he’s had such a shitty season, it’s hard to imagine we’d be able to get top dollar for him. My main issue with his potential sale though is….who is going to replace him? If we spend that money on a LB or w/e, we’d leave ourselves with a gaping whole in our midfield. Pirlo’s got maybe 1-2 seasons left playing at his top level (if we’re lucky), and Pogba we’ll be lucky to retain for another 2 season. Where does that leave us in terms of continuity?
With all that being said, I think it would be a far more prudent idea to try and get Vidal to sign a 2/3 year extension. I’m confident that by next season he’ll be back in full gear.

I am assuming you are thinking of a juicy transfer fee for Vidal. Apologies if I got that wrong.
As a general rule, the higher the transfer fee the more the player is worth keeping and the lower the transfer fee the faster the player should be dumped out of the squad. Exceptions of course do exist. Vidal I would keep for another season even if 40 million are offered.
Personally, I am uncomfortable with more than 2-3 max changes to the starting lineup and ideally not more than one in each major area of the squad. Too many changes to squad usually equate to a painful season. Following that logic, I would only change the following from the starting lineup:-
a. new LB
b. Trequartista if playing 4321, 4312, or 4231
c. Attacking RW if playing 433 (Berardi is the most obvious option)
I have left Llorente out because I do not consider him part of the starting lineup. He will probably be replaced by Zaza but in all honesty, I think Morata is the better striker.

I vehemently disagree with this. This topic has been openly discussed on previous threads. I believe that Ogbonna is a high quality CB. He didn’t look THAT bad yesterday. After all, how much can we expect from him when he barely gets any competitive minutes. I understand needing to build a cohesive defensive pairing, but the rotation this year in the CB slot has been almost non-existent. That onus falls on the coach, not the player. Caceres is also a very high quality player when called upon for both the RB, and RCB slot. He had a poor game yesterday, but overall he’s been a stellar player.
Rugani will likely join and hopefully stay next season. Barzagli will probably be around to see out his contract and then part ways.

As for why do we have a youth team – big teams cultivate a youth team only to make money. Sometimes, a generation jumps out of the box like Barca recently or the Man Utd class before but these are exceptions. Juve’s youth team rarely made it to the senior team.",Fefu ,"Mar 8, 2015 ", 6:18 AM,

He’s certainly not a natural left back and he’s not speedy. However, he can fill in there, even in bigger matches if necessary, but only with real backup, i.e. Chielini, not Ogbonna. Why was Padoin the last and only gasp against the counter-attack? I’d still rather see Padoin at LB than Ogbonna in a big match.
P.S. Yesterday was not a big match. It was exhibition baseball, where we trot out a B squad to let them stretch their legs and get some game action. Dortmund is all that matters this month. You won’t see Sturari, Ogbonna, Caceres, Padoin, Pepe, Llorente or Coman, starting against Dortmund. Of them all, I rate Llorente, Caceres and Padoin as the most likely subs.
Coman is a boy among men. His seemingly innocuous introduction against Dortmund almost ended in disaster and he was awful yesterday, as he’s been in almost every appearance after the opener. He should be lent out where he can play. We can’t risk his immaturity in any match that matters, which supports my premise that yesterday’s match didn’t matter.",Ricardo 1 ,"Mar 6, 2015 ", 12:06 PM,

Our left flank, it is already funky even with our current best player playing there (Chiellini & Evra), and last night I’ve to see Padoin and Ogbonna playing together, well… a Padoin Chiellini or Evra Ogbonna combo for the left side of defense maybe adequate, but both Ogbonna and Padoin playing together? It’s tactical suicide.
2. Same thing with the attackers, new formation, first time playing together between Llorente, Pepe, and Coman, it sounds like Allegri is going full retard last night, sure all three players were playing on their ideal positions, but without actual competitive game time between them it’s like asking for the impossible to happen, this coming from an Allegri fanboy here.
3. There’s one characteristic that never leaves this Juve after Conte left, which is the ""play from the keeper"" tactic, and Montella simply just redid his past homework, press the CB’s, give no room for the midfielders, the attackers will get isolated which will force us to do direct movements, and he’s prepared for that as well, just look how solid Viola’s defense last night, for a moment I thought they’re Bayern players in disguise.
4. Mohamed Salah, what a deal by Viola, what a player! Getting him for peanuts after selling a diving specialist like Cuadrado for 30m is a management masterstroke. Viola got themselves a real quality player there. Also if the news are true, I hope Marotta done sealing Neto’s contract, I like what I’m seeing from him.

Pepe is a solid rm for crosses as you mentioned, but you won’t see him cut in and go for goal.
And maybe an unpopular decision but I would have loaned coman out for the rest of the year. He shows so much promise and his potential is through the roof. I just feel regular playing time would speed up the process.
