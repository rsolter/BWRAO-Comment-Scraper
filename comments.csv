in the 2018 summer mercato, if we’d offered Pjanic (considered a top ten CM at the time) and Rugani (for whom Chelsea was offering a large transfer fee, but wouldn’t swallow Higuain), PSG probably would’ve taken the bait.","Posted  by Ricardo 1  on Apr 3, 2020 | 10:44 AM up reply rec flag"

Confirms what I’ve been saying for a while that Dybala is an amazing finisher even though some down rate this ability of his.
For the Juve players it reads:
1. Dybala +18%
2. Higuain +9%
3. Ronaldo +5%.
Lots of other interesting player results in there.","Posted  by Paolo C  on Apr 3, 2020 | 9:59 AM reply rec (4) flag"

Report: PSG turns down Miralem Pjanic-Marco Verratti swap deal,Danny Penza,,"I don’t see a point in selling one of, if not the best player in football history for anything other than a personal reason, even in light of the COVID-19 situation and extortionate wages he commands.
He has no real injury history, is a fitness fanatic and a mentor, shows no signs of slowing down, probably won’t produce much of a capital gain and he still scores goals for fun, not to mention the marketing he brings in for the club.
Assign any other name to that criteria, and unless your club was going under, you’d have to be a madman to sell.","Posted  by Shaulan  on Apr 3, 2020 | 2:19 PM up reply rec (11) flag"

If keeping him tanks the squad and forces the sales of Dybala and/or de Ligt what is the point of him being marketable?","Posted  by incredible holc  on Apr 3, 2020 | 4:00 PM up reply rec flag"
Report: PSG turns down Miralem Pjanic-Marco Verratti swap deal,Danny Penza,,"de Ligt would be kept – he’s marketable as well. Dybala has been on ‘sale’ for a long time – way before Covid. Also that statement was made on clubs wanting to transfer in Ronaldo. He’s already at Juve so the situation is a bit different for them. In a world where clubs collapse, you want to keep your biggest money magnet and siphon off sponsorships from the fallen.
So yes, CR7 might tank the squad but he’s also the best tool to save the club. If I may indulge in a bit of cynicism, in the midst of this disaster there is an opportunity to jump a few places in the money league. To do that you need pulling power and the initial cash flow to feed it.","Posted  by Fefu  on Apr 3, 2020 | 6:55 PM up reply rec (2) flag"

Small clubs do that and then sell their investments for double profit. Big clubs have a commercial plan, wait for players to hit peak and then poach by overpaying. So no it does not make sense unless your ambition is to hit a CL QF every 10 years and never win anything.
We have a completely opposite view of what Juve we would like to see. I want a financial juggernaut that does not rely on the sporting element for revenue – a ‘sugar daddy’ club that makes City and PSG look like austerity companies – basically what Juve was before calciopoli. A predatory club that boasts of throwing countless millions at players, just because they can – now that is the real Stile Juventus that I grew up with.
You seem to want an Atalanta or an Ajax – exciting, young, up coming underdogs but with no real ambition beyond feeding the super clubs with great players.","Posted  by Fefu  on Apr 7, 2020 | 5:50 AM up reply rec flag"
