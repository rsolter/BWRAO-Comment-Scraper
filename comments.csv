in the 2018 summer mercato, if we’d offered Pjanic (considered a top ten CM at the time) and Rugani (for whom Chelsea was offering a large transfer fee, but wouldn’t swallow Higuain), PSG probably would’ve taken the bait.","Posted  by Ricardo 1  on Apr 3, 2020 | 10:44 AM up reply rec flag"

Confirms what I’ve been saying for a while that Dybala is an amazing finisher even though some down rate this ability of his.
For the Juve players it reads:
1. Dybala +18%
2. Higuain +9%
3. Ronaldo +5%.
Lots of other interesting player results in there.","Posted  by Paolo C  on Apr 3, 2020 | 9:59 AM reply rec (4) flag"

Out:
Cristiano Ronaldo (probably the 2nd or 3rd hardest player on the roster to try to score a capital gain on a transfer)

,"I don’t see a point in selling one of, if not the best player in football history for anything other than a personal reason, even in light of the COVID-19 situation and extortionate wages he commands.
He has no real injury history, is a fitness fanatic and a mentor, shows no signs of slowing down, probably won’t produce much of a capital gain and he still scores goals for fun, not to mention the marketing he brings in for the club.
Assign any other name to that criteria, and unless your club was going under, you’d have to be a madman to sell.","Posted  by Shaulan  on Apr 3, 2020 | 2:19 PM up reply rec (11) flag"

If keeping him tanks the squad and forces the sales of Dybala and/or de Ligt what is the point of him being marketable?","Posted  by incredible holc  on Apr 3, 2020 | 4:00 PM up reply rec flag"
,"de Ligt would be kept – he’s marketable as well. Dybala has been on ‘sale’ for a long time – way before Covid. Also that statement was made on clubs wanting to transfer in Ronaldo. He’s already at Juve so the situation is a bit different for them. In a world where clubs collapse, you want to keep your biggest money magnet and siphon off sponsorships from the fallen.
So yes, CR7 might tank the squad but he’s also the best tool to save the club. If I may indulge in a bit of cynicism, in the midst of this disaster there is an opportunity to jump a few places in the money league.

The bitterness of Chinotto has a rather large effect on the flavour of food. Is it a quality that remains with Kinnie? and is Kinnie based on a specific variety of orange?
