Apart from the Milan game, I really don't recall the last time we allowed the opposition to come on to us and still looked in control. Even against Milan, we were defending a lead. I love this Juve over the occasional 5-goal scoring and 3-goal conceding one.

Dancing With Wolves: Juventus 1-1 Roma,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 15, 2010, 4:59pm PST",,Fine article once again. Agree with pretty much all of your ratings maybe with exception to Pepe who only looked good compared to his usual self. Hustle does not equal quality and the penalty was totally avoidable by keeping your arms in close to your body. Affelay would have been nice but oh well. I'll be happy with a full back and world class striker anyways.,Frank ,"Nov 15, 2010 ", 10:36 PM,

Dancing With Wolves: Juventus 1-1 Roma,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 15, 2010, 4:59pm PST",,"An awesome review..

Storari is doing great! In my opinion, Juventus has to swollow the poison and earn some cash on Buffon! we can use the money to fill our gaps and to bring in a striker. Storari can serve us for a couple more years. Meanwhile we can invest in a young goalkeeper (Sirigu or Viviano), and in a year or so, he'd be ready to take over from Storari..

As for the Aquaman, May god keep the injuries away from him.. He needs to be rested though.. Especially after the friendly with Romania!

Last thought… We need a striker for god's sake to play along quags… Let's hope juve goes the extra mile in the winter mercato and bring in some quality striker! and this should be our priority.. i don't think that we are in a desperate need for a defender, especially that sorenson is shining, and we can capitalize on the kid!

Pinsoglio also did pretty well in Primavera League.

I would still have Gigi..he is young in terms of a GK, when fit there is no one who can come anywhere near him. Storari is a good shot-stopper but Buffon is more than just a good shot stopper, he is a leader.

Dancing With Wolves: Juventus 1-1 Roma,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 15, 2010, 4:59pm PST",,"Great review! One thing regarding your comments on Trezeguet. He definitely would have come in very handy this season. But I still think the main reason he was sold was because he requested the move to Hercules. And if Trez did stay, we likely wouldn't have Quagliarella right now. Delneri wanted 4 strikers (Del Piero, Iaquinta, Trez and Amauri). Diego's sale also was a factor in signing Quagliarella, but I think had only Diego been sold and Trez stayed….we wouldn't have signed Quags.

Obviously it would have been better to sell Amauri though and let Trez finish his contract (assuming Trez would have stayed one more season). But finding a buyer for Amauri is no easy feat. I'm hoping the rumours of Liverpool's interest are true. If Marotta can give Liverpool Amauri + cash in exchange for Aquilani, he will be a legend.",Anthony ,"Nov 16, 2010 ", 2:11 AM,

I read an article were Nedved talks about Hamsik like he would like Hamsik wearing black and white. Now that Nedved is a director this view might help bring Hamsik along. But then I got to thinking, we need to get a forward, that is more important at this point than a midfielder. Dzeko is the objective and he will cost us 25-30m realistically, on top of that we need to get Aquilani, other 16m, unless Marotta decreases the way in which we pay for him and gets him cheaper. One way or another those are major investments and I don't see us getting a guy like Hamsik (or as good as him) on top of that unless we sell Buffon.

Dancing With Wolves: Juventus 1-1 Roma,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 15, 2010, 4:59pm PST",,"The penalty is still legit. It was taken in the 49th minute because the free kick came at the end of the 46th and then Pepe's infringement denied a goal scoring opportunity (no guarantee the ball was headed goal bound, but it is still an infringment). With all the arguing and in betweens, the game took another 3 minutes before the penalty was taken. But in my opinion the penalty decision stands because the infringment from the 46th minute affected a goal scoring chance.



The problem is that there is no consistency. Palermo should have received a penalty against Milan, and there is the big team mentality in Italy where the usual top 3, Juventus, Milan and Inter do get favoured to some degree. And now Roma have been added to that list.



The other problem that exists, is that when one of these teams don't get their way its the end of the world. I am a Roma fan (in case you didn't notice) and I too was appalled with the refereeing in the Brescia match. But shit happens, and a lot of the times things go our way over the smaller clubs. But I was disappointed with the players and management when they kept whinging about the treatment all week. Fair enough on the first day, but the persistent comments all week were annoying.



Finally, I think the actual encounter between the two teams was interesting. I think Roma dominated general play, but Juventus had the defense to answer all our questions. That young right back was impressive, especially playing out of position. Aquilani played very well for you guys, and Pepe looked like an actual player for a change. Juventus had the better scoring opportunities, Roma had the better play (if that even makes sense).

I think it's pretty sad how he has a “moviola” section every game… I mean come on, EVERY GAME? that's just sad, there's no need for that unless there's been some HUGE disgraceful referee call that got the whole world wound up…

My old coach (coincidentally my favorite coach ever), when we played mini-matches at training where he was the ref, always used to deliberately make wrong ref calls from time to time. Why? “We're gonna get wrong ref calls in our games too, so start getting used to it boys!” A team has to simply play well enough that they won't depend on the referee for a win.",Chukwueku_Akinyemi ,"Nov 16, 2010 ", 2:23 PM,
Dancing With Wolves: Juventus 1-1 Roma,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 15, 2010, 4:59pm PST",,"If there was the possibility of selling Amauri, then I totally agree that he should have been sold instead. I think he had an injury though, and that hurt the chances of him being sold as well. They could have potentially rescinded his contract, but I think Marotta is hoping that they'll be able to sell him for some cash. Let's hope that the rumoured interest by Liverpool is true. I highly doubt Amauri would go to a greek or turkish club lol. And if Liverpool is interested, then we might be able to arrange a swap for Aquilani.



Trez has said numourous times that he wanted an experience abroad before he retired. And he's said many times that he wanted to move closer to family. Hercules is based in his wife's hometown, so that gives him, his wife and his children the opportunity to be close to family. Trez's agent was also the one that came up with the idea and did all the negotiating. Juve were not actively looking for a transfer for Trez like they were for Camo or the others. I remember they said that if Trez was interested in a move, that it was up to him and his agent to come up with possible solutions. Had Delneri guaranteed Trez regular playing time, then he might have been convinced to stay. Trez would have been a part of his plans though. But we don't know exactly what happened anyway. We can only hypothesize.",Anthony ,"Nov 16, 2010 ", 2:35 PM,

The free-kick was called within added time. Referee Rizzoli extended time to allow it to be taken. Then seconds later there's the Pepe handball = penalty, plain for everyone to see. We are now well over the added time, but because a penalty has been given, the Laws of the Game state that time must be extended to allow the PK to be taken. Hence why Totti scored in the 49th.

However the fact it denied a goalscoring opportunity has little bearing on the decision. You're citing a rule which refers to what is and isn't a red-card offense.",Marco P. ,"Nov 17, 2010 ", 5:58 PM,

VotD: Aquilani v. Roma,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 14, 2010, 9:56am PST",,"After a day to cool off here is what i thought of yesterday

- Juve tied because we didn't score more goals than the opposition. The referee sucked, yes he did, but I remember when we played with Lippi and Capello when things didn't go our way, Nedved, Camo, Trez, Viera… found a way to get us back into the game. Plain an simple, we are still far from being a world beater

- With that being said, we have obtained 5 points from Inter, Milan, and Roma, not bad for a rebuilding team. If you take into account our injuries, and look at our place in the standings we are looking promising. I was looking at some stats and we have 4 clean sheets all season. Compare that with Milan who have 3, Napoli who have 4, and Lazio, Roma and Inter who have 5, we are looking comparable, and more importantly more solid on defense. Even more telling, last year we had 7 clean sheets all season (38 games). That means that every 5.4 games no one scored on us. This year given the number of games (12 games), every three games Storari doesn't have to get the ball from the back of the net. I know you can manipulate number whichever way you want to but this puts in number what I think most of us have noticed, we are a much harder team to score on than last year.

What is more surprising is that the only new player in our defense is Bonucci (sorry Sorensen, you are not a regular yet). And that points to the mentality of the team, first and foremost we will pressure our opponents and keep them at bay, next we will score. We have done this with an injury crisis affecting two centerbacks, and three fullbacks (Traore has played only 45 minutes and his contribution has been small if nonexistent).

This brings me to the Roma game, we had less of the ball, but more clear chances, and even though the draw was somewhat fair, we clearly had better chances. Same thing happened against Milan and to a lesser degree Inter, we didn't control possession but we were certainly more dangerous.

- Based on that, what this team needs most is a forward, however I think that is the last thing we are going to get. I am convinced that Marotta has first option to buy Dzeko next year, and Dzeko keeps scoring so I don't think we are buying a forward (or at least not an important one) next winter.

- The team played well yesterday. Melo was not his beastly self of this season but resembled his last year self. With that being said, Melo is light years ahead of Sissoko even on a bad day. Aquilani, as the above video shows was impressive on the first half and disappeared on the second half. Marchisio is growing in his new spot and looked solid as well. Pepe played a great game as well, if he played like that every game we will be ahead in the standings. Watching Pepe play reminded me of what Aaron was saying that Pepe is probably confused since he has been played everywhere, he clearly likes the right wing better than the left and can do some damage. The forwards did well until the substitutions. You would think Delneri knew by now that ADP does not play well on a 4-3-3, and it showed. Amauri should be sold, loaned, fired, or given an extended medical absence because his hair is not pretty enough, I don't care, he does not bring anything new to the team.

- I purposely left the defense out. Chiellini was a beast yesterday, he won every tackle and and marshaled the backline, he is learning to be a leader and his understanding with Bonucci is growing. Grosso was too average. Traore wasn't great, but he wasn't any better than De Ceglie in his first 45 minutes of the season. We have to give players time to grow. And lastly Sorensen, he was a solid defender, so much so that most of the attacks were coming from Grosso's wing. He made me feel comfortable when the other team attacked the right wing. With that being said, his crossing is abysmal, and his passing needs a lot more work. Countless times the ball had too much power and ended up causing problems to the players receiving the pass. Those things are things he needs to work on, he has a cool head and as a 4th choice defender after Legro he seems like a viable option (sorry Rianudo, I hope you stay in Napoli). Someone said we can buy Sorensen for 140000 euros, that would be a great investment. With displays like last night I am sure we can sell him for 10 times that much at the end of the season.

- And last but not least, Forza Milan (the Italian Milan that is).",Jose ,"Nov 14, 2010 ", 5:46 PM,

-Sorenson should keep his place at RB until Grygera recovers.
-At least GDN tried to win. Ranieri showed us why we wanted him out with the Totti sub.You just knew they were going to sit back and play the ball to Borrielo to hold up play. We drew too many games under him in this manner.

After this weekend heavy game 2 more like this expecting us – Genoa and Viola.

My concern is for the first one especially.

We need to win finally against Genoa for moral boost and important 3 points. In last 2-3 seasons we've been constantly beaten by GENOA, Palermo (7 from 8 times) and Napoli.

If i gotta be honest i want Juve to beat these 3 teams permanently and then i'll breath easy and relaxed that finally we are the same old giant. I can accept lost from Inter,Milan Roma but to loose 7 from 8 times (if i'm not wrong) from Palermo for the last 4 years is disgrace.

We've grown a lot under GDN in last monts,no doubt. The only thing which is still missing is consistency against lower teams. The title will be in our objectives once we start hammering these type of teams.

The things are going smoothly apart from injuries and rebuilding is looking brightly IMO.

To be full of proud every Juventino we just need to invest and finally found a oalscoring machine upfront.

It was visible that we can cover every other position around but lack of goalscorer is still tabu. I like Quaqs a lotand i do believe that we can keep him if he produce season like this all to the end.

The problemthat if we want Dzeko we need money, if we want to keep Quaqs, Aquaman we need another 25-30mln so guess what will be our main concern in next years – MONEY!

That's why we urgently need to sell two huge carpenters in our team – Sissoko and Amauri.

Once we sell them for 20-25 mln we can get Dzeko easily.

The season is far from boring this year and nobody knows what the hell will happen this year – i don't think Milan is sure for the title if they play on both stages, so expect teams like Napoli,Viola,Palermo and Genoa to make the mess for title bigger. In the end we can be on the top if we are consistent in our play , doesn't matter we will loose some points here and there. IF TEAM PLAY LIKE LAST 40 DAYS DEFINITELY WE WILL BE SOMEWHERE ON THE TOP.

and for inter finally winning something with no italians, let me say this: it is nothing to be proud of. in the age of monstrous multi-national corporations, post-industrial football, teams with no identity other than money, inter fits perfectly. they should move the club to the new york stock exchange permanently and be done with it. moratti's oil money should help. in other words, if inter left italy today, few inter fans would feel something was wrong. but something IS wrong, isnt' it.”",juvealways ,"Nov 15, 2010 ", 2:13 PM,

Specially when Aquilani was being pressed he had to control a very strong ball and didn't have enough time to turn around and do anything meaningful with the ball.

Sorensen doesn't need to become a great crosser and run up and down the flank to be good. He just needs to be able to calmly distribute the ball to the midfield.

Bonucci also helped his confidence for not yelling at him when he was nervous during his debut last week.

Now I'm not saying he actually sucks. I'm just saying that he's young, and he should not be given the burden of a first team spot at such a young age. I don't even think he understands Italian language yet! IMO it would be best if he's introduced to the Serie A gradually. I like the kid, and I hope we sign him next summer!

I still remember how Ariaudo was shipped out on loan by Silly, Stupid, Secco because of his performance against Roma (and douchebag Totti), and I shiver to think that Sorensen just passed the very same test, while playing out of position!

PotD: The Next Captain,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 13, 2010, 3:29pm PST",,"My thoughts:

THE GOOD
Aquilani was awsome, he basically had a free role tonight, he popped up everywhere, and hes passing is mint. We must do everything to him fully ours.

Chiellini was awsome. He read every pass, flew for every tackle and won every header. (Loed how he threw a tantrum at the end, really was funny)

Pepe was great tonight. Him and Aqua man were our creative sparks tonight. He impressed me with some good crosses and switches.

Quags was again showing hes worth. That pass to set up Iaquinta for the one on one was simply awsome. Poped up everywhere and really liking the way he played today.

Marchisio, oh how i love this guy! A great team perfromance from him, he has some very good tricks and quick feet, i just wonder how we will fit him into the centre.

Frederik Sorensen, is a name to remember, let this guy learn some Italian and damn he will be good!

THE NOT SO GOOD
Why did Grosso come off fro Armand? Didn't see the point, was he injured?

Melo was okay defensivly but he passing was frikin wayward today.. hope its just a one off.

ADP really was pretty poor after coming on. Lost the ball several time and that last free kick was poor.



Overall, it was a pretty dissapointing result, Roma did play pretty average, could've and should've come away with all 3 points.",Sampath ,"Nov 13, 2010 ", 9:14 PM,

One thing I wanted to comment on- Chiellini at the end. As most people know I'm a big GC fan but that was really classless from him. He's bleeding from his head and wouldn't come off?

PotD: The Next Captain,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 13, 2010, 3:29pm PST",,"Not too upset abt the draw, i m more sad didnt get to see brazzo or lanza. the way roma was playing (especially) in 2nd half having a right winger whose crosses can actually reach players in the middle (n not blocked by first defender between pepe them). Dont get me wrong pepe performed better than his usual standard but his performances made me miss krasic a lot becoz seeing the amount of space pepe had on the right u just know if krasic was there at least there will be more chances on goal.

I was quite pleased with sorensen n traore.
Sorensen was very solid n blocked many attempts of crossing/ scoring only dangerous one that when by him i remember is vucinic's pass to mexes (we all know wat happen next). His long range passing is bad he looked like pepe 2.0 but with much better defending skills. I hope he keeps his place at rb coz havinga defending fullback like him will give martinez/krasic alot more freedom upfront with little worry to track back.

Traore his substitution made sense, it was grosso's 3rd game this week n with roma attacking through left alot a fresh pair of legs was needed (not sure y brazzo didnt went in instead of him).Considering wat we had heard abt him (being awful as fullback coz his defending sucks) from epl fans he was quite decent imo. His defending was good especially considering he was defending totti first n then borriello n he was back from injury n it was his seria a debut. ofc he was like a terzino version of sissoko (who wins n losses the ball at the same rate) but keep in mind he was at the left flank where roma was pressurizing alot n players like adp , marchisio n aquilani was losing possession there, so he was under alot of pressure. Judging his passing rate for now will be unfair but he definately looks better than wat i expected (defensively at least).

Marrota n Paratici looks to have done a good job in scouting.

I m also very pleased with del neri (i know its only 14th of the season gone) he has improved this squad alot despite many players being new to each other (showed alot in 2nd half when they didnt realize wat their teammate wanted n misunderstanding occurred i guess this will improve with time) from the first matchday when most of us doubted we will get to 4th place, right know he is giving us hope that we may (A VERY HUGE MAY) get a silverware this season.

An Amauri (Am) should be a unit to measure how much a player (or person) sucks. (e.g. Molinaro)

A KiloAmauri (KAm) would be a player 1000 times worse than Amauri (e.g. Zebina)

I practically sacrifice my weekends to watch soccer all day. Just like you i want Juventus to be the best. To be able to compete with Bara and Madrid (even though we own Madrid)Man United, Chelsea etc. We are on that path. I would like to make some observations and suggestions:

Just like everyone is echoing, we need more quality up front. I have the utmost respect for Iaquinta and his goal was world class yesterday but, Iaquinta should be playing for Fiorentina, Sampdoria, Udinese, Lazio, Napoli – high quality teams but non equal to the history of Juve. I am not taking a knock at those teams nor Iaquinta but am merely illustrating a point. We are Juve – we make stars and we get stars. Same can be said with Amauri. I am his fan. I think the reaction and the comments he gets from this blog is not warranted. He started great, and he has sunken. Its time for him to go searching for his form again. I HIGHLY recommend we LOAN him out in the summer. A loan might be able to kick start his hunger again because the negative comments and abuse are sure not doing the trick. I call a spade a spade and his not playing up to par. The young Dane – i think his done a hell of a job filling in at the back for us but whoever is thinking or suggesting his ready to start over the host of mediocre backs we have is very wrong. This kid has major work to do still. His extremely flat footed, his positioning from deliveries are way off, his passing needs some refinement, and the list continues. Again, that is to be expected when as an 18 year old – we need to keep showing him confidence and plugging him here and there – some of the Europa games etc… but NOWAY he should be starting. Traore looked sluggish. It seem to me that he could only kick and dribble with his left foot. He seemed very one dimensional and have more confidence with Grosso than him. I think Aqua is a MUST sign and must to play for the Azzurri. His class is unmatched and i sometimes watch him even out fox our players. Quads is playing with confidence, and has been a joy to watch. I am happy that his getting the credit he deserves. Chiellini you showed your passion for the Old Lady and because of this you will be a Juventus LEGEND – loved by all your fans.

PotD: The Next Captain,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 13, 2010, 3:29pm PST",,"Iaquinta and Amauri are both fine as Juve strikers in principle.

The issue is that they have NEVER been starting material though and in any other Juve of the 90's, they would have been brought in as replacements.

Ideally, Iaquinta should be a 3rd striker on a team like Juve while Amauri should be a 4th or 5th.

To me, Iaquinta is not much different than let's say, Michele Padovano in terms of overall quality and contribution.

Amauri on the other hand, in terms of overall quality and what he brings to the team is closer to a Daniel Fonseca or Marcelo Zalayeta.

The misfortune that was our incapable front office post-Calciopoli led to us paying starting player quality amounts of money (Amauri more than Vincenzo) for guys who have never been great or difference makers in their careers.

And I disagree with loaning Amauri, he will be 31 at the end of this season, his salary is too 'heavy' (4+ million) and his contract will be up in June 2012. If we don't sell him then even for just a couple of mill, we risk keeping a huge liability both on a football and financial level only to have him leave on a free at the end of next season.

Other than that, I agree with pretty much everything you said.",jorid22 ,"Nov 14, 2010 ", 3:51 PM,
PotD: The Next Captain,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 13, 2010, 3:29pm PST",,"Well said. I wouldn't mind keeping Iaquinta as a sub for Dzeko (if he ends up in Juve) or any other world class striker. But Amauri has to go. If two seasons are not enough to discover his form, then he should be shown the door. Personally, I don't think he has the quality to even be on the bench at Juve.

Other than a qaulity striker, we also need a RB. I do have faith in De Ceglie to improve, but Motta shouldn't be more than a sub. We have our center covered with Chiello, Bonucci, Sorensen and Legrotaglie.

I haven't really seen much of Martinez, but I hope he will be able to provide as much as Krasic. We are playing wide and we should have more options than just Krasic, there needs to be a balance.

Aquilani/Melo/Marchisio are great as well. We shouldn't think twice about Aquilani. He is the future of Azzuri midfield. I like Sissoko the fighter, but he loses as many balls as he wins them.",MC00 ,"Nov 14, 2010 ", 4:17 PM,

They are dead weight, just dragging this team down. I think that I would reinvest the amauri sale into obtaining Giuseppe Rossi or use Amauri as part of the deal. I think that the Dzeko price is outrageous and I don’t think that Juve should spend that much on a player that is not a guarantee. In all honesty, my desire is for Del Piero to never retire, but personally I believe that Rossi would be an excellent player to help fill his eventual void. He is not a great free kick taker but a natural goals scorer with great dribbling ability, something this Juve team lacks upfront. Although highly unrealistic, getting macheda would be incredible.

I would not extend the loan deals for Pepe or Motta. Pepe is a hard worker but not a quality player in my opinion. I would like to see Juve obtain Elia from Hamburger SV instead. For the defense, Clichy or Agger could be suitable replacements. I would try though to get De Silvestri, however, as the prime target. I think that I would also focus my attention to Zaccardo. Aquilani is a must keep, the player is making this Juve midfield; what a wonderful steal from Liverpool.

- The refereeing is way below par. They cut numerous attacks for offside when there was no such thing in sight. Didn't intervene in various points with fouls, but gave easy yellows for others. Very uneven, almost bizarre performance by the referee, and if it goes on like this, he'll lose control of the game in the second half.

Also we needed Brazzo in for Sorensen just to be more aggressive on the right.Pepe improved a lot in second one.

The draw is fair result but we could get more.

Roma was shaky on the back and we didn't pushed them a lot.

Aquaman was closed in second and we suffered in center and cretivity, but Marchisio was in charge nicely.

In general, fair result but i do believe our subs our somehow predictable which was discovered by stuppid Ranieri. We lost another points and i hope milan derby to be finished as a draw but….

Really? He gave pretty much a typical Pepe performance; ran a lot with very little production. He had one cross that hit its target (the one for Marchisio's chance) but all his others were all over the place. And he wasn't unlucky with the penalty, he was stupid.

I don't agree on Pepe however. The handball, regardless of how unlucky it was, cost us the points. He NEEDS to keep his arms close to his chest to avoid being unlucky. Besides this I think everyone watching Pepe play confuses desire and hustle (which he certainly has) with impact on the game. Countless times this season he madly dashes up the wing to soon find out he has no ideas once he has completed his runs. Today was slightly better but he really does not have the quality to play for a scudetto contender, atleast in a wing position.
Last thing, 5 points against top sides is great but we really need to maximize points against bottom teams for the remainder of the season to keep our ECL hopes alive.

Our attack was supposed to be our problem child, but we're scoring almost every game. Our defence is rock solid with Bonucci, Chiellini and even the young Sorenson hanging to his own. We're still recuperating Grygera and De Ceglie here what will give us an enormous boost. Not to forget we are recuperating Gigi f*cking Buffon…

In midfield we are playing without either one of our two attacking flanks (Martinez and Krasic) and we are still able to bring in a huge amount of crosses and we're scoring goals…

Only minus today was Traoré who had a weak game if you ask me. And Iaquinta really should take advantage of occassions like in the fifth minute, what a waste…

- We always seem to struggle against weaker teams. You can't imagine that it is the same team that played again Inter and Milan is the one that played today again Brescia. Players showed no interest whatsoever.
- We still have a lot of work to do in defence. At least 2 players were watching Diamanti while he's scoring.
- We looked tired. Injuries are starting to wear us out. I dunno how far we can go like that.
- With games coming against roma, fiorentina and genoa, this was the game to win.

- Let's face it, no matter how Sissoko or Pepe are hardworkers, they are simply not Juve material. Sissoko can never get a pass right and same thing Pepe can never get a cross right.

- Del Piero is great but he cannot play that many games in such a short time.

Awkward in defense, rarely provides a worthy contribution up front, never leaves his mark in the game as a whole. The only things I remember from the 30 minutes I watched him play today were the yellow he got which made him ineligible against Roma on Saturday and the image of him chasing down Diamanti as the latter made his way into the pk area and scored.

Also, I'm as much of a Momo fan as the next guy and have always tried to play down the Grand-Canyon-sized hole that is his technical ability but even I'm starting to get sick of it. More performances like this and I want him sold for 8-9 million with Luca Marrone coming back in his place. If we're going to keep a liability on our team then it might as well be one that costs less and has potential for improvement.

Non-Preview: Juventus Travel to Brescia to Take on Z3BINA,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 10, 2010, 10:16am PST",,"There are a few things about our team that we need to be aware of:

- With a full squad, against a big team we are likely to win. Playing against a big team makes us very focused, add to that our height and age and we are likely to outrun them, and outmuscle them (see Inter, and Milan)
- When we play against a small team we are not focused, that comes with having a young team. Today we let a goal in because we were distracted, not because their attackers are amazing
- Our team is tired and the injuries are taking a toll mentally, much more so than physically. Our midfield has changed every single game for the last few weeks. Our center midfield has been Melo-Aquilani/Melo-Sissoko/Marchisio-Aquilani/Aquilani-Sissoko. I think that is all the possible pairings we can have (and I am not including the youngsters that played against RBS). We are out of wingers, Krasic is gone for two more weeks, Martinez for months, Lanzaframe is just back and needs time to recover. That essentially leaves us Pepe (Marchisio is not a winger). The new Juve has a great starting midfield (I would say one of the best in the world), but our replacements are horrible to say the least. This is a project and we need to get it through our heads that there are things that we just can't ask of this team.
- My last thing, the one that infuriates me the most is the comments from our coach. If he thinks we are going for 4th place then say so, none of this “the sky is the limit” nonsense, if he thinks we the sky is the limit for Juve then play like that. We are tied 1-1 against Brescia, a coach that believes that Juve has no limits (as stated by Delneri) would have taken out Sissoko and put in Lanzaframe because 1 point against Brescia is just as bad as none. Instead he takes out Aquilani and puts in Lanzaframe… take home message he doesn't believe we can do it and we are taking all the points we can get in hopes of getting into the CL.

Don't get me wrong, I am well aware that Juve is 4th place material. But then say that, then at least our players will go against the smaller teams and try to rack points, because that is what a 4th place team needs to do. Our players are sometimes under the impression that this shirt will get us to the scudetto, that having Agnelli as our president is the key to win. Today we lacked motivation, and that for me is the coach's job.

Anyway, we could have been 2nd on the table but instead we are 5th, we have Roma breathing down our necks and Napoli ahead of us. The game against Roma has become remarkably important. Say what you want about Melo's celebrations but he really pumps up the team he was missed today. Krasic also would have sped up our play immensely. Today no one was running, Aquilani looked up and his best option was Chiellini, that is ridiculous.

With time we will recover those two and will get back up there in the 3rd and 4th places. The road is still long and hard, and I hope somewhere down the line Delneri is told that his job is to win all games. To take out the defensive midfielder and put an attacking winger. And that to win games you need to work harder than the other team, no matter the colour of the shirt you wear or the number of stars it has.",Jose ,"Nov 11, 2010 ", 1:29 AM,

EPL was the first league to have 20 teams (and if I'm not mistaken, they used to have 22 teams) and we all know how England fare in WCs and Euros (well, that and the beers and the arrogance and overall lack of technical skills).

I know less games means less money for all parties involved in the business but surely they can find a solution or middle ground in order to give us fans better matches. After all, football clubs are nothing without their fans, aren't they?

Personally, I blame Zebina for last year. We would sit down to watch the game, the lineup would come up, and we would just look at each other incredulously – what the hell was Zaccheroni thinking? And how was Zebina in the lineup week after week? We assumed he must have some kind of voodoo powers or some serious blackmail material!

As Adam states it is merely an abbreviation of Sørensen. On Lyngby Boldklub's homepage it is actually spelled “Søe”. What the e is doing there, I don't know. When that is said, I would love for the nickname to have that connotation. I just want him live up to it first :-)

As a sidenote, an insider told me that everybody was a bit baffled that Juve signed him on a loan this summer. Most people in and around Lyngby BK didn't think of him as one of the most talented players in his age group, let alone position. But then again, who cares? Juve's scouts (and Delneri especially) just may prove them wrong.

I wouldn't mind if Grosso stayed to finish the season too, as long as he knows De Ceglie is the starter. But he's only really playing now because of the injuries to De Ceglie and Traore. Once those two are back, Grosso will never play. So we might as well get a little cash for him. Brazzo's contract expires at the end of the season anyway, so we wouldn't even get 1m euro for him probably. So he might as well stay. Plus, he's pretty versatile.

If we win a Scudetto this year, that will be incredible, but it should not be expected. Delneri has been more than incredible for this team. His players are buying what he is selling, and he's the best allenatore in Serie A right now. Also, we're only at the quarter pole of this season.

We just cannot go 'all out'. No team can. We need to grind out results with our limited squad.

Bonucci is looking great out there, Pepe is doing his job alright and always shows the determination of a pitbull. Keeping hold of Melo was masterpiece one (helped by Delneri) but probably more important to the general Juve fan out there:

I think the biggest question mark is Martinez, followed by Traore and Rinaudo (now that we have finally seen the primavera play). Also letting go of caceres was mystifying.

Pellegrino Helps Juventus Overcome Cesena,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 7, 2010, 10:14am PST",,"Motta was cheap idd, and could make a good substitute but I don't see him sitting on the bench, he's too talented to do that and too young. I'd prefer to let him go and get someone that is ready to play as a starter for juve. Someone like Caceres for instance. Letting him go was the only mistake Marotta made (next to keeping Amauri instead of Trezeguet) imo, but he wanted that fixed as soon as possible and at the time Caceres was too expensive, so I understand.

Traoré and Rinaudo were always just going to be here for one season just to fill the empty space. So I don't bother them not getting any playing time.

Martinez is indeed a question mark, but has shown flashes of brilliance so far, so I'm quite assured he'l be a great addition as well.

As for Quags, I don't like the words “panic buy” concerning this transfer. Marotta surely had some options lined out next to Di Natale with Quags being probably the best one. And he is simply showing his worth by working hard and scoring. The grinta with (a little more) talent mix, you were talking about can be applied here :). It's not just his versatility, it's his presence, his movement, his dynamics and of course his goals that make him so useful… Right now I would take the option, but I agree we need to see more.",Robee ,"Nov 7, 2010 ", 8:48 PM,

I think last year the believe was that we were going to win the scudetto, and that was our only objective. Our players started super excited, won more than they should have and when they finally realized their weaknesses they gave up. Once the scudetto was out of reach no one really cared to play for anything else.

Now the message is clear, let's take it one game at a time and try to win as many games as possible, come May we will see how good we really are. I think that is fair and good. We have a very young team, a young team can get very excited and play over its potential. Also a young team can psychologically crumble if they realize they are not very good.

The thing i m glad is like it was pointed out in podcast that most of them r impact injuries n not muscle strains (like last season). The way i look at nothing is wrong with training it becoz most of our players r young n fast so opponents tend to rough as a way to stop them. Most of our injured players r wingers n fullbacks

Could be blessing in disguise since next 2 games is cesena n bresia we can see if any youth player is good or not n since i understand cheillni;s injury isnt bad we could get our 4th cb n wont have to spent more money on a new one n test out pepe at full back post. n with lanzafame reported back (not sure how true it is) we can see his n maybe a few primavera capabilty in midfield n wingers. We could end up saving money to buy back ups n invest in forwards.

The best part is we will get to see Gainnetti/Libertazzi playing. If they perform good we can sell amauri in january n can wait till summer to get a top class striker which will be better since we will have a better budget n more players will be available.

This year both of them r tied at 3 goals out of which amauri has his in preseason.

N pls dont start abt him getting better than del piero. If he wasnt even 1% as good as u talk abt he is he would have scored more than del piero who had less than 30 games n is 35 years old n a second punta n not prima punta like amauri.

N fyi for a juventus club striker playing against a unknown team in europa league scoring one goal isnt called scoring for fun but an average (max) to bad performance.

N for experimenting prandelli even called molinaro n skipped balzaretti so r u going to call molinaro world class? n fyi he got 1 call-up for a friendly match n thats it. Thtats not call italy's first choice striker.

At least Vincenzo Iaquinta is available, though obviously he can’t play from the start after coming back from such a long time off with a muscular problem. It doesn’t take Einstein to know Fabio Grosso will play left-back and I think he’ll do well.

We mustn’t think about the injuries, instead taking it one game at a time. Everything is going wrong, but I hope we have the right character to stay united and support the team. Our youngsters will help us out. The training methods have nothing to do with it, as only two are out with muscular injuries. The other 10 are from trauma on the pitch. We are simply unlucky.”

"Time to ""Spring"" Forward the Youth Players Development",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 5, 2010, 11:02am PDT",,"Yeah Chukwueku, Grosso and Sorensen are confirmed to start. But I think Marchisio and Pepe will play on the flanks and quags and adp will probably lead the attack. Also, adp had almost 2 full games in one week so if Iaquinta is fit enough to start, I'd rather he start from the bench.

Btw, I'm quite impressed with Giandonato on the RBS game. Hopefully, we can see more of him tonight.

In addition, great news last night. Without eto'o, those scumbags is a mid table team right now:

I guess del neri must have saw something in training. I hope lanza starts in the wing, coz if we start pepe it might end uup like the first half of the away game at RBS where all the attack was going through middle (since marchisio will be helping full backs n the midfield).

Anyone notice this benitez whose mentality is like Ranieri n the way his team plays is also quite similar (i remember reading somewhere then when he was learning coaching he is to go n see how ranieri trains the team). Now has the same injury crisis we had in the past 3 seasons (muscle strains). So is it that its not training facility fault n the fault is in training.

P.S. i will not consider ferrara n zach since one was novice n the other one start coaching after a long break so i think their method was kinda similar.",Sj_juve ,"Nov 7, 2010 ", 2:43 AM,

"Time to ""Spring"" Forward the Youth Players Development",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 5, 2010, 11:02am PDT",,"My thoughts on the game:

- Good performance considering half of our starters and half of our bench was gone.
- Motta was getting slaughtered on his side until Marchisio and Pepe switched sides. Good tactical move from Delneri and great response from Marchisio. Motta looked solid after that (ie. Marchsiio made him look good).
- Sorensen was crazy nervous at first and then settled better. He doesn't inspire much confidence yet but I hope he grows into that role. Watching the replays I noticed how big he is. He has potential and I hope he plays many Coppa Italia matches and even a couple EL
- Bonucci is still a work in progress but assume his role as defense leader very well
- Grosso played a good game. Honestly he inspires much more confidence than I think Traore will. I say Grosso + 5m for Ziegler in January and we are set on the left wing for years to come.

- Marchisio did everything that was required of him. The assist to Quagliarella was a beauty. The kid delivers and sacrifices himself. He is not as technically gifted as Aquilani but his grinta (y los huevos que tiene) and determination are I think among the highest in our team. That is what happens when you grow with Juve and are dedicated to our cause.
- Sissoko makes me nervous. He recovers balls but gives them away. His card was totally unnecessary. I like him for his determination but I feel his time in the club should be over. I would have rather seen a Primavera alongside Aquilani
- Aquilani… MOTM for me, what a complete player we have in our hands. We better start gathering our 16m for him. One problem I fell we have is that we have no other regista in our team, we should invest in another passer of the ball to cover for Aquilani. At least he gets rest when we play in Europe-
- Pepe. He was not good. I admire his dedication but if he is not going to play fullback then he might as well start packing his bags
- Melo… He had a clearance that reminded me too much of last year. I don't understand why Delneri would bring someone that wasn't match fit. If Sissoko couldn't handle his own he should have put Brazzo in on the first place.
- Brazzo. Nice assist, incredible professional.

It just occurred to me that we finally saw a Marchisio-Aquilani partnership. Even thought we were decimated everywhere we didn't look to fragile in midfield

- ADP what a beast
- Quagliarella – Nice diving header, great runs and great dribbling
- Iaquinta – What a goal
- Amauri, what a great game he gave us. His contribution from home is invaluable. All the clapping and cheering from his house can not be understimated. I hope Delneri learns how invaluable he can be to our team when he is played in his natural position in front of a TV at home. Great game big Brazilian, great game.

- Juve are 4th still and holdling onto that place for dear life. Next week Roma will be a great test. Hopefully we can recover Chiellini. I also hope that Melo's injury is not serious and he can be back in 5 days fully recovered. Grosso and Brazzo, I have never been a great fan of them but they behaved like professionals. Let's hope Inter drops more points soon so that we can climb up to third. Forza Juve, and Forza Amauri (as long as you stay in your house).",Jose ,"Nov 7, 2010 ", 1:13 PM,

Albertino was quiet but consistent in the 1st half and exceptional in the 2nd. What a commanding game!
Kudos to the Mister for understanding the need of a CM pairing and sacrificed a bit on the wing-play…this allowed both wingers to help the full-backs stop the occassionally marauding cesena wingers… great work GDN!
The defensive display on the wings this game as well as our CM lock-down at San Siro confirms that we're back to being awesome at defending!!! If the room's not breathing easy now, I don't know what will make them! (apart from Amauri locking himself up at home)
Attack-wise, there wasn't too much we had to do to break the defense down outside the box, but WE NEED A BOMBER….WE NEED A BOMBER….WE NEED A BOMBER! If we had any movement at all inside the box, we would've been 5 or 6 goals up…on the brighter side, atleast Signor Beppe knows exactly what the team needs…I hope.
Aquilani seems to blend in with any midfield partner, making him a starter. his break from the EL games are also a HUGGE boon. I'm just hoping against hoping against hope that he doesn't add himself into the 'i got a booboo momma' list. Not even once this season, PLEASE!!

Bonucci is SURELY going to be a liability in the months to come…the number of times he gave the ball away instead of passing to the midfield….aaarggh!! Defensively, didn't have much to do… except harass grosso out wide :)

Grosso – Very good game for someone who hasn't played a competitive match in over 6 months! Nonetheless, his age shows… the ziegler option I'll bite!

Motta – Looks more and more suspect defensively. Why in the world did Thuram have to retire!?

Melo – Absurd sub in for someone who's not match-fit…maybe Melo was right when he claimed last year that he was too tired and hardly ever match-fit….

Sissoko – Back to his beastly and brainless best…steals the ball and passes it straight back! Think he's getting his confidence issues again, with Melo rightfully above him in the pecking order…

Pepe – Looking more like a confused full-back rather than a part time winger… Del Neri's got work to do here.

Marchisio – Slowly working his form back…very evidently can captain the side!!!!!

Quags – Gem!

Iaq – Best for sub role when we're attacking, and the goal sealed his rep.

ADP – sublime as always! But his legs are wearing out…

Sorenson – Needs more time , but atleast LOOKS like a solid defender

AGIAMBA EAT YOUR WORDS!!!!!



i'd also like to add the following:



10 reasons to support amauri:

1. his hair are like beautiful locks swinging across his face everytime he scores and celebrates, giving him a warrior type image.

2. his facial hair gives makes him look like a tough guy with his own version of stone cold steve austins famous beard.

3. his body is a work of art and sculptured to perfection with his chest being as wide as a house, hence the amauri/chielline chest celebrations.

4. he has modelling contracts across the world and women love him. One even offered her services to Amauri for free, in hope that amauri would touch her, as he has the midas touch.

5. He has taken the number 11 shirt like a duck to water, and wears it better than former players like nedeved. whilst he is also currently juve’s most important striker ahead of iaquinta, ADP and Trez.

6. Amauri is better than iaquinta endof. as Iaquinta always sits on his arse on a hospital bed, picking up wages for doing nothing.

7. Amauri has great finishing ability, such was the case during palermo, and his first year at juve. The system most recently has not favoured him, but from inside sources, he has been the best player in training under del neri and will be lethal next season.

8. There are photos and videos of him naked on the net. Take a look, he is very large indeed. : heres the link -http://blog.stripperboyz.net/2008/08/amauri-carvalho-de-oliveira-naked.html?zx=42fd9e584fff6b90

9. its always great to sing amauri chants such as this:

AMAURRIII WHOOAAA

AMAURIII WHOAAAA

HE SCORES GOALS FOR FUN!!

HE FUCKS IAQUINTA IN THE BUM!!!

AMAURI WHOOOAAA

AMAURIII WHOAAAA

10. Also it is great to support amauri as you always feel as you are part of a community, in his recruitment agency. Supporting amauri is the way foward, and the fact that he is juve’s most important striker currently, suggests that it is time for us all to have great faith in Amauri’s ability as footballer and a sex god.","Gurnam ""bigman"" ","Nov 4, 2010 ", 10:50 PM,

Sissoko's head is not in it. He's never been a good passer, but now he just gives away fouls as well as the ball.

PotD: Sums It Up,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 4, 2010, 3:01pm PDT",,"how to be a successful striker 101:

1. work yourself into goalscoring positions i.e. watch build up play and anticipate where to position yourself such that kicking/heading the ball into (not over or against!) the goal can be done with minimal resistance and maximum success

2. apply the right touch with the right body part when the ball comes in (don't attempt an elaborate overhead kick where a volley would suffice)

a highlight reel of great strikers (trezeguet, battistuta, crespo, shearer, van basten etc.) would show that steps 1 and 2 are the prelude to just about every goal they ever scored.

HOWEVER

1.amauri does not do either of these things. his interpretation of his role as a striker is to drag the ball to the corner flag and win a corner kick/freekick. he hardly ever runs into vantage positions, and on the rare occassion that he does so , he goes for the needless overhead kick or the random header against the bar/into the exact same position where the GK is positioned

2.amauri at palermo still had a bit of engine in him. he was leaner and could run at pace. amauri in turin is overweight and could'nt be any more stationary even if his last name was immobile!

3. time to let the dude go! even if we cannot get a buyer in december, freeze him out of the squad and get someone who has read 'how to be a successful striker 101' …. dzeko/benzema can still arive in the summer, but it is imperative that we buy/loan/kidnap/clone a prima punta in the january window … amauri is minus one and we cannot afford to lose the battle for want of a horseshoe!",Denny ,"Nov 5, 2010 ", 6:46 AM,

Juventus v. Salzburg: The Incredible Serb,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 4, 2010, 9:58am PDT",,"We're at home, against Salzburg. After 3 draws, 3 points tonight is a must.
It's time for GRINTA!


Juventus is hunting for points in Europa League vs. Salzburg, on a delicate challenge, even though not decisive yet.
Group A classification is currently led by Manchester City with 7 points, followed by Lech Poznan with 4, and then by the bianconeri with four 3 and by the Austrians, with 1 point.

So this evening Juve will be looking carefully also to the score-board: in fact, this evening in Poznan they’re playing also the match between the English and the Polish and, inevitably the result is affecting also Del Neri’s boys. In case of victory, as a matter of fact, the City would be mathematically qualified, and would stake a serious claim on the Round’s first place, but would also allow the bianconeri, in case of a success against Salzburg, to climb over Lech Poznan in the classification and play the following two matches from an advantageous position.

But before focusing on making any calculations and on the many possibilities, Juventus will have to get over the Austrians and it’s not a foregone conclusion: on first leg match, Hubb Stevens’ team proved to be a tactically tidy team and with great individualities. Moreover, Del Neri will have to meet the many absences and the team may suffer the labors of the match vs. Milan. But Juventus must restart right from Sunday victory: by the determination they put while on the pitch at San Siro, this Juve can overcome Salzburg and any other opponent.


List of those called up. You might notice we have a total of 10 (yes, TEN) senior players in the squad.

2 Motta
5 Sissoko
8 Marchisio
10 Del Piero
11 Amauri
19 Bonucci
23 Pepe
27 Krasic
30 Storari
31 Costantino
33 Legrottaglie
35 Buchel

41 Giannetti
45 De Paola
46 Liviero

Of course we played dull. I bet Barcelona would play dull too if they only had 10 senior players available (or they wouldn't know HOW to play dull, and lose). Let's not forget, that even with a 100% healthy squad, we only have 3-4 players in our entire squad who can truly be considered 'world-class' – players who would make it into the starting 11 of, say, Manchester Utd or Barcelona.

Lest we forget, thanks to our impressive recent results, we are in a rebuilding phase. We still lack quality. We do have grinta. Earning a point in Europe with a decimated squad is nothing to be ashamed of. Now to beat both City and Lech Poznan.

Juventus v. Salzburg: The Incredible Serb,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 4, 2010, 9:58am PDT",,"I only watched the second half, some thoughts

- First and foremost, Aquilani and Melo make this team look so much better. I think their influence is larger than Krasic on this team, and that says a lot
- If there was any doubt whether we should give Legrotaglie an extension this should clarify things. He plays well with Chiellini and Bonucci, and his work ethic is immense.
- Motta played descent, but again, Dani Alves was not running up his flank
- Liviero (the kid playing at left back) was good. Between recalling Grosso or Brazzo I will give this kid more minutes. He was super nervous, and it showed but after two or three games he can be better than Grosso. The kid can at least defend
- Sissoko should be sold. I love the guy, and his assist against Milan will always be remembered (in the bloopers section of our history). Marrone can take his spot and he can't be much worse I am sure.
- I get why Delneri plays Amauri. He wants Amauri to score goals to get his confidence back, if he scores goals he is more likely to be sold in the future, also, he is big and can hold the ball well. Those are all good things but Juventus is not the place to get your scoring boots on, if you don't perform, get your groove back in Siena or Udinese but not here. Selling him should be a priority but I am sure we can offload him even paying part of his salary. Last, if he is brought to hold on to the ball that is fine if we are winning the game, but when we are tying a game we should be scoring Libertazzi would be a better bet.
- The EL drives me crazy, playing games like this on Thursday with league games on the weekend is scary. If Legrotaglie is really injured let's hope that Chiellini is back in full strength. I think Juve should play all competitions to win it, but I for one, will not loose any sleep if we fail to qualify.

I really hope Legro signs a contract extension too. As far as I know, he's said he'd be cool with being a 4th choice CB.

If it's like the case with Trezeguet though who always said that he wanted to end his career closer to family, then I would understand if Juve let him go at the end of the season. Trez himself requested the move to Hercules because they play in his wife's hometown and his wife and children would get to be close to family. So if Legro has some desire to end his career in Bari or play more regularly, then I would understand them letting him go at the end of the season.

But like I said, Legro hasn't really made any comments to suggest that. Though he might just be choosing not to talk about it publicly. We'll see what happens at the end of the season. Hopefully he stays.",Anthony ,"Nov 3, 2010 ", 9:49 PM,

Storari: 6.5- Never had any miracles to save, but had to stay attentive and be smart. Did his job very well against his old squad.

Motta: 5- Didn’t read the play well or make tackles with assurance. Another relatively poor performance.

Bonucci: 6- Was troubled occasionally by Ibrahimovic, but otherwise played another very solid game, confirming that he is Juve material.

Legrottaglie: 6.5- Came into the coaches plans in the last few minutes of warm-up, as Chiellini suffered a minor calf injury and failed to recover. Played immaculately at the back, marshaled the backline well.

De Ceglie: 6.5- Has really grown into his role as a left-back in the last 2 months, such a shame he is out for so long. Looked confident in marking and tackling, and of course, his crossing was money as usual.

Marchisio: 6.5- A very intelligent and tactical performance from Claudio, who plugged holes, started counter-attacks, and held his flank well, be it on the left or right.

Felipe Melo: 7- A tremendous performance from the ball-winning Brazilian. Was in the midst of every midfield event, tackling and winning the ball back frequently.

Aquilani: 5.5- Bit of a let-down after his performances recently. Was slipping all over the pitch, managed to get a bit more into the game when he changed boots, but still a relatively subdued game from Albertino.

Martinez: 6.5- Battled real hard on his flank, playing with personality. Also managed to show flashes of his technical ability.

Quagliarella: 7- Ran a lot, pressuring Pirlo in midfield and keeping Milan’s defense honest. Scored a wonderful header, and also picked out Sissoko with an intelligent cross-field pass for the 2nd goal.

Del Piero: 6.5- Didn’t see a whole lot of the ball and sacrificed with Quagliarella by pressuring Milan’s midfield, but was effective and intelligent when on the ball.

Delneri: 7.5- A tactical masterpiece. Nothing more to say than that.

Pepe: 5.5- Talk about a tough environment to change positions in. Beaten by Ibrahimovic for Milan’s goal, but never should have been marking him in the first place.

Sissoko: 6- ROFL. That is all.

Amauri: s.v.- Brought on to waste-time, so we could launch the ball up to him and the Italo-Brazilian would protect it. Did the job required of him.

It was clear as day he wasn't really going to play much anyways so why not give him the special task of keeping in contact with ED9 in order to badmouth BM and Uli Hoeness to Edin while persuading him to join Juve?

It may sound ridiculous but like Aaron posted a few weeks ago about it, Saliham already knows and talks to Dzeko anyways, it would have only offered him greater incentives to try to convince him to join us in June.

as for melo … res ipsa loquitor

amauri continues to disappoint… with palermo he was leaner and quicker, with us however turin he's grossly overweight, has all the mobility of an articulated truck and thinks his job is to win cornerkicks/freekicks , spur on the fans and lead the victory parade at the end of the game! somebody lock this guy up in a room with DVD's of drogba, torres, andy carroll & batistuta …

Honestly, can you say otherwise? I'm not saying he's a pleasant character, but a lot of people who are willing to criticize the guy on tuttosport and other places never saw him playing, and would have felt not quite the same if he was a character from their formative Juve-fan years. As someone who HAS witnessed the 80s, he was no Platini, Zoff, or Rossi for me, but was a legend nonetheless. Whether he deserves that star more than Davids or someone else is a different question; but I think the point had to be made to be fair to Boniek.",juvealways ,"Dec 30, 2010 ", 4:27 PM,

Some players cannot be appreciated unless you've seen them and experienced the times. Sure, the numbers don't add up for Boniek, but who said this star business was a rational, statistical affair anyway (just look at all the hype and debate on the papers now)? I have never been #1 fan of Boniek, but he certainly was one of the players that stamped the character of Juve in the 80s. Regardless of his asinine comments, or his statistics, people who experienced that period will have a different attitude about this business than people who didn't.

As a fan of the national team, I've seen many greats pass over the years. When I try to place Salvatore Schillaci in memory, I don't remember the miserable career that he had in terms of numbers after his first season at Juve, and I certainly don't compare him with the likes of Zoff, Rossi, Scirea, Baggio, Maldini et al in the national team; I remember the notti magiche of 1990. He will always be remembered like that, by many people. Now, his legacy might be in question, because as time passes, a lot of people will grow up looking at numbers, videos, etc and the name of Schillaci will become less and less well remembered.

I just found it an interesting read when it came out though, since personal statistics were being used as an important criterion for determining who deserved a star. I was surprised nonetheless, I thought Boniek had played more games and scored much more than just 31 goals.

Looking at the Toto`Schillaci example, I can see Grosso as a perfect example of what Toto` is remembered for in 20-30 years from now. His goal against Germany will remain a great moment, while the rest of his career meh.",jorid22 ,"Dec 30, 2010 ", 6:22 PM,

Agree by saying that people's memories are relatively short. But if I really had to take a stand, I'd judge him by what he said/did when it mattered…when we were down and needed support…it's easy to wax lyrical on a player during our glory years, but it's show of incredible character to show uninfluenced support to a club in it's dark days (Buffon, ADP, Pavel, Camo, heck even Lippi!)

On the pod, you guys talk about the Traore deal and are resolute that there is no option to buy at the end of his loan. However, I've heard some contrasting reports that Juve actually does have an option to pick him up permanently if we wanted.

I know that Arsenal was shopping Traore around this summer for a permanent transfers (Benfica being a club whose name kept coming up). Seems odd that 1) Arsenal would suddenly change their tune and want him back at the end of the loan, and 2) that Morotta wouldnt secure some kind of right to buy, when he's been so keen on that model, as we've seen with pepe, aquilani, motta, quags.

Last year, what I remember that he was shrugging off was the personal criticism against him, not showing indifference toward Juve. He has always been positive in the media against all odds. If you think it didn't affect him or his family, why do you think he left Italy?

And as for the World cup, that was class, not attitude. He encouraged Quags not to be strong and not to completely lose it in public, and he personally waited until he left the pitch to cry. (I have that pic on my desktop.)

The guy is a natural leader, and as NT captain an Italian hero. Plus an amazing player (the only defender to ever win the FIFA world Player of the Year award.) I understand if he is not popular w/Juve fans, I even understand if you even dismiss his entire Serie A career. But what he did w/ the NT alone is highly valued outside of Torino for sure, so I am just surprised that you all are willing to “throw out the baby with the bathwater.”

"Podcast- Aaron's Back, It's Recording, But There's No Football",The Offside Juventus,"Dec 30, 2010, 10:13am PST",,"There are lots of natural leaders and world class players in the national team. Look at the expression on Buffon's face during our matches in SA. Look at the passion, the sense of occasion, the dedication in Buffon's face when he couldn't play and had to watch on the side. Now compare it with Cannavaro's expressions during and after matches. What's the difference?

No, it was not “class” that made him give happy little smiles all around while the team was struggling, tooth and nail, to get into a semblance of competitive spirit, of taking things seriously. Look how he reacts when he screws up a defensive play and it results in a goal. Does he apologize to teammates? Does he make an embarrassed or frustrated face at the very least? Nope, the guy just brushes his hands on his shorts, smiles and runs along.

The loss of spirit in Juve last year rests squarely on his shoulders (and Camoranesi among a few others, if we're to believe the media). He was certainly one of the best defenders in the world, and he deserves every praise for 2006.

However, NO player in my book has the right to smile around when his team, whether club or national, is going down the drain. The role of the captain is to stay cool, to be sure, but when your teammates are putting their blood and skin on the field, but losing, you DO NOT smile around. I have a picture of Quagliarella crying while this nincompoop was smiling vaguely towards the crowd. Look at Del Piero as a captain; look at Gattuso as a captain; do they yell, get frustrated, and direct their teams as best they can when these things will serve the situation? By all means. Are they cool when necessary? Well Del Piero is, and Gattuso, er…but anyway, you get the point.

The captain of a team LEADS the team in ambition, in spirit, in competitive will. Sets an example on and off the field. When he needs to calm the team down, he does that. When the team needs a kick in the ass, he does that too, and puts his blood on the line. Did Cannavaro do any of these things in the last 2 years? Come on.",juvealways ,"Jan 1, 2011 ", 1:11 PM,

Now the question is: are Marotta & Co. gonna honor that contract, or will they try to buy Cannavaro out of the deal? I too trust the current management, so whatever they decide will be in Juve's best interest.

-Intelligence and hard work.
He doesn't have an ideal height for a top class central defender but yet he was one of the best at his position in the last decade. His superb positioning and timing and and jumping ability certainly helped but I don't think one with such physical limitation can achieve the tag “one of the best” without hard work (ronaldinho, take note) and having superior intelligence (compared to most of the players).

-Leadership skills.
When he played during his height of the game, aside from the technical skills, two things stand out to me: calm and confident.

Ex-players with these kind of quality of characters are rare so he will be a good director. But then again, I'm just analysing with limited info so I could be totally wrong.",dwicarta ,"Jan 1, 2011 ", 2:59 PM,

I cant get mad at Juve if Dzeko signs with Man City in Jan, b/c Juve literally can not do anything about it b/c of the transfer rule in italy about signing more that one non EU player. But if somehow Dzeko stays at Wolfsburg until June, and Juve lose out, then I would pissed b/c Juve have the money, especially with the new stadium bringing alot of $$$$. Also, you can say that Man City can out bid every other team in the world, but the asking price for Dzeko is 40 mil Euro, and no team in the world will pay more than the asking price. Juve have 40 mil( 30 plus Sissoko) so they have no excuse to try to get him.

Pretty soon they'll hold a fire sale for their bench players, and savvy teams will end up with rejuvenated stars like Inter did with Schneijer and Spurs did with Vandevart. So Juve should be patient, keep integrating the terrific new players we've added (Krasic, Quagliarella, Sorensen, Aquilani and Storari), start working in some of the others waiting in the wings like Traore and make strategic acquisitions when we can. Dzeko isn't the only fish in the sea. Beware other clubs trying to unload “name” strikers for huge transfer fees. The same goes for Van Persie, whom Juve should avoid at any cost. Good strikers who would represent huge upgrades from Iaquinta or Amauri are languishing at struggling clubs. Wigan's Rodallega. Make a play for Jovetic on the bet that he recovers and shines.

Is anyone here remotely perplexed at our January transfer market strategy? I'm still trying to figure out if we'll end up with anyone. What a mystery.

For me, in January, we need a back up Aquilani, and a striker. OFFLOAD AMAURI, sell Sissoko for the summer Dzeko deal, loan or buy Cigarini, and get someone up front who has played with Quagliarella and Iaquinta. I prefer Pazzo but Ill take Gila over Amauri any damn day of the week. I'd take Floccari too.

Now with that out of the way, what I meant with playing and winning in Europe in part due to our misfortunes for them is related to the fact that they got off the hook fairly easily in '06 while Juve was used as the scapegoat (when we all know Milan was no different than Juve or inter in their relationship with referees/designators etc). It was a reference to Juve being humiliated, Milan getting a hand slap instead. It has nothing to do with how great they played or what they showed against Man Utd, they shouldn't have been competing in the UCL to begin with. They should have been facing Rimini and Spezia just like Juve. I'm sure you've heard all the Galliani-Pairetto, Galliani-Bergamo, Meani-Bergamo, Meani-DeSantis, Meani-Mazzei phone calls.

Berlusconi also asked for the revoked scudettos to be reassigned to Milan more than once when the 'scandal' was still fresh back then. Hypocrisy everywhere.

I don't know, although Rino might come off as a real stand up guy/man of his word etc, I can't take him seriously/nurture the same respect for him as I do for Maldini for example.",jorid22 ,"Jan 1, 2011 ", 11:15 PM,

But it is not fair to put blame on the players then or now. Everyone knows that Gattuso, for example would have never been able to mastermind anything, other than maybe the headbutt that was originally suggested. :) And while Maldini may be more respectable, he lifted the 07 CL trophy – doesn't that make him equally culpable? No, neither of them were involved in matchfixing.

Calciopoli hurt the players and fans most, and Juve 100 times more than anyone else. But to say that hurting more players and fans would right the wrongs or cure the injustices is not right, either. There is no undo for this one, only doing as much as possible to make some things right – like returning Juve's 2 Scudetti – or maybe awarding bans, fines, and other punishments to those who were actually responsible, like directors and club presidents.

There is no fair in Calciopoli, there never will be. All we can do is to right as many things as we can away from the game, and to slowly erase its horrible memory by focusing on winning on the pitch.",MrsShankly ,"Jan 2, 2011 ", 1:50 AM,

-I don't think I ever said that Ringhio could have been behind Calciopoli lol. I don't think I've ever said that Totti or Materazzi were behind it, just like I don't think any other Serie A player (Juve players included) is to be held responsible for any possible irregularities/corruption in the league (then and now; unless we're talking about betting on matches which is a completely different topic). I said Milan should have not been playing in that UCL. Again, it's not about Milan's players, how they played in that season's CL, how the team handled the turmoil of the '06 summer, how they fought against the punishment they were given or anything of the sorts; a player's job is to kick a ball. It was a normative statement. The comment about Gattuso being Berlu's servant was simply a stab at Rino being a lifelong servant of the team owned by one of the shadiest men Italy has ever known. He didn't pick the president of the club he plays for and I'm not expecting him to present a grad level dissertation on why Calciopoli was a gargantuan schadenfreude anytime soon either.
I also said that despite Gattuso's words being refreshing, they didn't strike me in a particular way-partially because Calciopoli has desensitized me and left me cynical about calcio in general but also because although he's a funny guy, I've never taken him too seriously (because it's Gattuso after all lol).

-When the topic of what can realistically be expected out of Casoria's judgement and the Naples trial for Juve specifically and Serie A in general has come up, I've always sided with those who have said “don't expect anything major, no relegations, no considerable fines, no 180 degree turns, at the most Juve will get back the 2 Scudetti”. I'm often not too bright but I'm not dumb enough to expect FIGC to use its magic wand and make inter vanish into Eccellenza in an attempt at restoring justice. In comparison, there's a far greater chance of the sun revolving around the earth than such measures being taken anytime soon or ever for that fact. Hope dies last they say however, so I shall continue to wish for San Siro's pitch to be hit by an asteroid next Tuesday, a sudden fire to engulf Pinetina on Wednesday, Berlusconi to finally lose a trial for once in his life, Massimo Moratti to pay a visit to Facchetti within the end of the year and so forth. :)

Hopefully I didn't enter MAD territory with the wall of text above (although my writing is far less suspenseful as it's dirt-poor of his trademark aposiopeses). And I've honestly enjoyed the debate with both you and Marco, I like talking about Calciopoli.",jorid22 ,"Jan 2, 2011 ", 3:00 AM,

You are right, nothing could erase the memory of Calciopoli. The only thing I can compare it to is having a loved one murdered, in which there is nothing that can take it back only a mockery of justice to be served.

On the asteroid at the San Siro, can we plan that for when Inter are playing? Because it would still hurt Milan, but I'm partial to my boys. :)

And if hell should freeze over and Berlusconi ever be punished for ANYTHING, (even a parking ticket) the party is at my house, you are so invited :)

And if you ever compare yourself to MAD again, I will never speak to you again. Suspenseful writing requires something interesting to be written in the first place, and I have never witnessed this anomaly with him.

On one hand there are rumors that the deal with Man City is done, on the other hand, Highlander_mak posted here either yesterday or today saying that Dzeko had been interviewed by Croatian media after he had taken part in an indoor tournament in Split, Croatia and had said that none of the rumors about him reaching an agreement with a specific team were true.

On one hand there is today's Tuttosport edition, which on its main page has: “Dzeko close to City but Marotta is on his way to Wolfsburg to 'block' the player for June!” and on the other hand Marotta has made it clear as day numerous times that Juve will not waste their time with bidding wars. Just a week ago, Italian media posted supposedly an interview of his that said: “I want to play in the same league that Ronaldo and Sheva have played in.”

I won't pull my hair out if he ends up at City but I'll admit I'll be a bit disappointed as I think he'd fit our needs perfectly. I will be angry if neither him OR Pazzini are in a Juve jersey come next summer though.",jorid22 ,"Dec 30, 2010 ", 3:18 AM,

First Beppe says he won't be coaxed into a war, then claims that the Dzeko dream is over. Meanwhile, Dzeko speaks to Diego AFTER the start of the season about Juve and Turin. Then Man City makes a huge bid again to sign him next year while Wolfsburg is quiet about it. Then Dzeko rejects it and still claims that he'd like to play in Serie A…

My guess is that Marotta is trying to calm the rumor mills down by down-playing it for now, but is definitely in talks with Wolfsburg. I'd say this because of his recent claim that the coming summer will see Juve make some 'major' signings.. I have my faith rooted in Beppe, but I will not be able to hide my regret if either Dzeko, Pazzo or Romelu don't come in next summer…all of the three would be perfect fits for a bomber…",vidder911 ,"Dec 30, 2010 ", 5:36 AM,

"Old Faces Return To Vinovo, One Hopefully Temporarily",The Offside Juventus,"Dec 29, 2010, 9:44am PST",,"It's all good, sorry if my initial response was rash.

I've been trying to keep up with Wolfsburg too and although Dzeko is NOT playing like he did in 08-09 or 09-10, he's still doing pretty well IMO.

-He's got 9 goals and 3 assists in 17 Bundesliga matches. That's a very nice >0,5 goals scored/games played ratio.

-He's got 1 goal, 2 assists and 1 og in 2 DFB Pokal matches. Again, his goals scored/games played ratio is 0,5+.

With Bosnia's NT, he's got 2 goals in 5 games, which again is a pretty decent ratio. I watched him when he played against my NT (Albania) and although he was fairly quiet for most of the match (Lorik Cana's marking of Dzeko was great and Ibisevic played a greater role for Bosnia), he still played ok and hit a post if I remember correctly.

The Serie A defenders are tougher than the Bundesliga ones IMO but there are 2 promising points out of all this IMO:

-this is one of Wolfsburg's worst seasons in a while so far, if not in their history. As Juve fans, we know something about those after last year and we also know that when you have a torrid season, good players look average and average players look horrible (Buffon's season was not bad but far from his best, Melo struggled A LOT, Grygera who has been fairly reliable this year looked atrocious last season etc).

-Dzeko's mind is not at VFL, he wants to GTFO already.

When someone is still producing as consistently as he is despite the 2 above mentioned points, that's a pretty good sign of the type of player he is.",jorid22 ,"Dec 30, 2010 ", 2:25 PM,

Also, you can say that Man City can out bid every other team in the world, but the asking price for Dzeko is 40 mil Euro, and no team in the world will pay more than the asking price. Juve have 40 mil( 30 plus Sissoko) so they have no excuse to try to get him.

It's bullshit so far. Absolutely nobody else has reported anything relevant to it yet, only a few outlets who have copied the same story pretty much.

Rumored that the offer was of 45 million Euros to Wolfsburg and 6/year to Dzeko. Although they have boatloads of money, I don't think Al Mansour and co are dumb enough to waste an extra 50% of a player's value when the latter's club just came out and said that 30 million is his price.",jorid22 ,"Dec 29, 2010 ", 4:27 AM,
"Tuttosport's ""Big Pagelle"" of the Year",The Offside Juventus,"Dec 28, 2010, 1:21pm PST",,"All throughout last season, when Blanc was pretty much the head of the club, he showed an inability to hold such a position. For someone who possesses the sporting world experience he does and who's technically the head of a club like Juventus (even for just a few months), to display the ridiculously poor media handling he did is pitiful. And I thought Cobolli was bad at it.

He failed to publicly come out and offer his clear faith and support for the team/Ferrara above all when it was very much needed (even Zamparini comes out often and does this for his managers and it's Zamparini we're talking about here), he looked like an utter imbecile when he said: “When we win the Scudetto we're putting that 3rd star on our shirts!” during pre-season, as it only made him look premature and added unnecessary pressure on a team filled with doubts.

Is this all fair? Maybe not.
Did his work probably look even worse than what it really was due to the horrible season we had? Most likely.
JCB is a grown man and a professional though and I'm sure he consciously accepted the responsibilities of the positions he was given last season, therefore, I don't see why it's so ridiculous to blame him for having failed as a CEO, club president etc.

TL;DR: JCB is to blame for failing as a CEO, he should stay as part of the club AS LONG AS all he does is handle the financial side of things, nothing more. I have much more faith in Marotta for everything else.",jorid22 ,"Dec 29, 2010 ", 4:22 AM,

Heartbreaking.

A 17 year old teenager (only child too) in Switzerland named Vincent was killed by a reckless driver last Wednesday. Him and his whole family were huge Juve fans and as you can see from the link, his funeral was filled with Juve gear. Him and his dad drove to Juve games often and after the liturgical service, his coffin was taken to the cemetery while “Storia di un Grande Amore” was playing.

The dad said: “Now in the Curva Nord there will always be an empty seat”.

But whem you compare that to his ground skills, which really sucks, you get a pretty average striker who add something to a club as Udinese. But not to a club like Juventus. What we need is a good combination of ground and aerial skills. Like Quags is showing at the moment.

We need another striker, and in my opinion, sign Lisandro Lopez. Perfect striker who can guarantee of a certain 15-20 goals a season. Capable on the ground and in the air. Age 27, so should be at the top of his performance, and should be able to play in the first team for at least 5 years. He might be a little expensive, Lyon bought him for 24 million euros.

Christmas eve. Another night, another bridge. A foggy and chilly night and it seemed that no living creatures would be sane enough to be out of their comfort home. But to the trained eyes, they would be able to see two shadowy figures on the bridge. Both had incredible aura, with tension was high in the air. The older one smoked a cigar and the younger one looked cool but determined.

Younger: So how are your bunga bunga doing?
Older: Not too bad… They make me feel young (grinning widely, and with that, the tension dropped)…. but those newspapers just wouldn't let it go!

Younger: Yeah you know how they are… It's nearly christmas and these are slow days to them. Hell, they even had enough bullshit to claim that my Krasic was going to work for Arsene.
Older: (Chucked)… Yeah I dig what you said…. By the way, nephew, your agent just blew everything apart.

Younger: Yeah sorry uncle, you know how he is. But like we talked before, and as I promised, my agent would last at least until christmas… and he would. Tomorrow, tough, he's as good as gone.
Older: Yes he is. And I know you did your best to keep him there this long. Anyway, just like we predicted, my agent is ready and if all goes well, he'll be activated tomorrow.

Younger: Don't worry uncle. He will be. And of course, your agent will keep those merda no higher than 5th and no lower than 7th, won't he?
Older: Of course, nephew. You can trust me on that.

Younger: Of course I trust you, uncle. Like you promised you would lay your hands off the Fantatonio?
Older: ……

Younger: It's allright uncle. We like him but it seems you need him more.
Older: Sorry kiddo. But that kid Dinho is just killing me… Sigh…

Younger: It's quite allright uncle. Of course you won't disturb Dzeko, Schelotto, and that Piazon kid, won't you?
Older: C'mon kid! Three for one? That hardly seems fair!

Yonger: I know uncle, but you don't have enough money for Dzeko so essentially just keep your hands off Schelotto and Piazon. And I'll help you with your bunga bunga case.
Older: ….. allright kid (smiling fondly). You really know how to make old people like me happy.

Younger: I'm also fond of you uncle. It's getting late. Shall we uncle?
Older: Let's go nephew.

They hugged and go their separate ways. Just as the younger guy nearly reached the steps, he turned, smiled, and said, “Oh uncle, Buon Natale!” The older guy, with mist in his eyes, replied, “Buon Natale, nephew.”

Just as the younger guy got into the car, he said to the driver, “You got all of that, Beppe?” “All good, boss,” replied the driver.

The boss: My dear uncle did promise that his agent will keep those merda between 5th and 7th but I'm not entirely convinced with this Leo guy. Have you got OUR 2nd agent ready?
Beppe: I have, boss. Ready to be activated anytime Leo screws up.

The boss: And is Ziegler in the bag?
Beppe: He is, boss.

The boss: Good. Great work, Beppe.
Beppe: Thanks, boss. You're no slouch yourself (grinning). Oh and boss, buon natale.
The boss: Buon natale, Beppe.

Very happy with those high up there listening to the fans and taking action accordingly. Boniek's name should not be within 150 km of that of Boniperti, Scirea, Sivori etc.

To think that Andrea Fortunato was not given a star and Boniek was…I'm surprised and disappointed his name is once again not on the ballot for the 50th star though. Once the new stadium is up and running, there needs to be some kind of recognition for him, whether it's naming a curva “Curva Fortunato” or a part of the stadium “Sezione Fortunato” w/e, as long as there is some homage to him.

Unfortunately, I don't know most of those on that list either, although I'm sure that Davids will win. In the same poll going on at Vecchia Signora, Edgar is winning by quite a lot.

I don't think Dzeko is a mercenary or that he conned Juve, although I agree that Dieter Hoeness is a **** who wants to turn his team into a feeder club for Bayern.

PotD: Yet Another Draw,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 20, 2010, 6:48am PST",,"Okay, lemme put out a few things i've thought out after i cooled off. For one, while Krasic should have finished that off, watching the replay show we should at least give him credit for carving out such a wonderful scoring opportuniy. Thing is, after beating the goal keeper, he foundf himself in a rather tight angle from which it's rather easy to miss. Couple that with the fact that a defender (not sure which still, watching videos on my phone makes it rather difficult to recognize certain players) was running back to cover the little space Krasic had to put the ball in the net. The best way to score that was to try to put it where the defender could find the ball difficult to reach – in the air. Too bad he put it a tad too high. Gotta give im credit though. That said, i've got no defence for Iaquinta's miss.

I thin I partly blame the draw on GDN. I'm not as good as he is, but i think i'd have left either Krasic or Quags on the pitch to keep the Chievo defenders honest. I'd also not have six defenders on the pitch at once; that's inviting too much pressure and I tell you, that goal was a long time coming.

Grosso did okay (his crosses were still terrible, however, when they were existent) but I must reitirate that he's too slow and almost always lost out when put on the run. I don't think I will be missing him once PDC returns.

I mean, yes, Amauri has been a sack of sh*t this season but we all know he's one helluva striker when fully fit and on form. Iaquinta, on the other hand is never really a prolific goal scorer even on top form. Sure, he does provide assists but right now, we've got too many players that can do that. It's obvious that our problem is not creating scoring opportunities but finishing them off. And I thimk an in form Amauri does that better than Iaquinta. So what d;you guys think? Personally, i'd like my christmas gift this winter (apart from a new prima punta) to be an in form Amauri by January. Who's with me?

PotD: Yet Another Draw,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 20, 2010, 6:48am PST",,"I needed a couple of days to clear my head from the draw against Chievo, we were so close but then we ended up loosing two points in the dying seconds. I guess we now know what Lazio fans felt a week ago.

Now, if we had to win one game and tie one, I rather we beat Lazio and tie Chievo. This brought us two points from 2nd place instead of the three we would have had with Napoli and Lazio, so I will take what we got.

This game really highlighted how strong our starting midfield is and the lack of depth in the dressing room in those positions. I already said that Marchisio makes Melo and Aquilani look good, but also Melo makes Aquilani and Marchisio look good. With one of Melo or Marchisio available we would have won this game handily.

This brings me to the depth of the midfield. I am all up for youngsters and all but Marrone and Ekdal would have been great for the Chievo game and I think better than Giandonato overall. Marotta has said he is not bringing anything amazing for the winter period, no Dzeko (we knew that), Suarez, Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Maradona, and any other player that Tuttosport will link us to int the next month. Marotta however has said that the summer market will be good. This points to the team not changing its original plan, we are going to qualify to CL, maybe in second place, if we win it with what we have, great, if not, as long as we finish 4th or higher the season will be considered a success in the eyes of Andrea and Beppe. He has said that we might bring a few reinforcements to make the team stronger and if that is the case then I think we can make it much stronger with little money and set us up well for next year.

We need a vice Melo, specially if we sell Sissoko, in that case I hope Marrone comes back, he can play all the Copa Italia matches and the Serie A matches that Melo is injured or suspended, he can do likewise for Marchisio. I think if Sissoko leaves and Marrone comes, the kid will not be hurting for playing time. We need a vice Aquilani: I have always liked Cigarini, but if not Poli will be a welcome addition as well. There is no other player in our team that can do what Aquilani can so having a replacement to give Aquilani a break here and there is just great. Those players will come at a higher price than Marrone but they won't break the bank, that is for sure. The last one that I read on this blog was Schelotto. Of him I am a little unsure, he can play RB or RM, in RM he has to compete with Krasic and that is simply not going to happen, not this year at least. In RB he will compete with Grygera or Sorensen (sorry Motta, I see you out of our team). But Grygera and Sorensen are very different players to Schelotto. A right wing with Krasic and Schelotto might be lethal but it might also leave some huge holes at the back. With that being said he might really help Juve when we are trailing.

In the absence of Pazzini coming this January, those three players (Marrone, Cigarini/Poli, and Schelotto) will not affect the starting 11 greatly but will certainly help with the depth problem that has made Juve pay one too many times.",Jose ,"Dec 21, 2010 ", 8:06 PM,

PotD: Yet Another Draw,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 20, 2010, 6:48am PST",,"I have posted about Farsopoli here before. It nearly converted me to Juve, because the whole world was against them and it was so clearly unfair. I was so inspired by the players like Buffon who opted to stay and play in Serie B when they could have easily furthered their careers. However, I don't blame the ones who left, there was no way they could have afforded to keep them all, even with gigantic salary cuts.

Unfortunately, I chose Milan for what they do on the pitch, not for the wicked, horrible, ridiculously powerful owner. Yes, he has and does and always will use his power and influence to damage opponents and further his own cause. Our points deduction that year was reduced at the last minute so that we could still play in CL, which is even more ridiculous than everything else that happened. I am not proud.

They were dark days, and unfortunately, the dark lord is still in power over my beloved team. But I am hoping that the new trial brings some semblance of justice and closure, with the 2 stolen Scudetti restored to Juve. Even if it brings more justice in whatever form to my Milan.

And while the league is healthier now, I wouldn't say that things are back to normal. The image of Serie A (and especially Juve) is forever tarnished, stadiums are still empty, and players opt to play in other leagues. But I am glad it is competitive now, and truly hope that Juve and Milan are the 2 teams that contend for the scudetto this year.

5. which one january purchase would make the most-significant impact on our fortunes in 2011?",Denny ,"Dec 22, 2010 ", 7:48 AM,
PotD: Yet Another Draw,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 20, 2010, 6:48am PST",,"Here are some of my opinion (pardon me if i am wrong).

1. I think Giovinco has potential. But he has been quite injury prone this season. I think we see how it performs in the rest of the season. If he does well, we take him back. This will bring me to another point on which I hope we bring a left winger on loan to end of season.
So at the end of the day, we can choose: either the Winter Transfer guy or Giovinco

2. I don't think Storari might leave. He came to Juventus knowing full well that once Buffon recovers, he will be 2nd choice.

3. For Lazanfamme. I got no opinion on it… wondering what went wrong too :D

4. We still need the full back. If PDC is injured, we shouldn't be depending on Grosso
and on our right, Motta aint doing well. Grygera is not that good. While Sorenson is just young. That being said, I think this problem should be fixed in the summer not January.

5. A striker?! Prima Punta to be exact. Pazzini? Or very hopefully, okezD.

There's no way Iaquinta is light years ahead of Amauri when both players are on top form. You guys are obviously still pissed at Amauri for being a total pine for the last year and half but let's be truthful, in Amauri's first six months with us, who would've picked Iaquinta ahead of him? We've forgotten (and unavoidably so given his form) that he could dribble, hold up play, dominate in the air, make good movements in the opponents box (yes, move) and above all score goals. Were we not rather glad to have got him from Palermo and thought he was worth his price in his first few months? Granted he's been beyond terrible in recent times but that doesn't remove that the fact that on top form, Amauri is really good. Hate him all you can but GDN and Marotta kept him for a purpose; to see if they could revive the old Amauri. If they succeed, we would probably forget about all the missed goals and tree standing and shiny hair and probably call him a sex bomb (kiddin' :) ). Remember Melo last year and Melo this year. Last season Melo was the evil bastard in midfield and we all wanted him out. Now there's possible no line up we think of for Juventus without Felipe Melo in center midfield. Melo was terrible last season but that did not take his qualities (which he's shown really well so far) away from him. Look beyond the hate, we would only be too happy to have the old Amauri back.

Also, I really hope we go after Balas Dzudzak…I'm not sure what other left wing types are out there, but getting a top-flight player on the left flank would also allow Marchisio to get back into the middle, where we all agree he belongs. Everyone seems very content to let Claudio play out his prime years out of position Please lets let him grow in the middle of the pitch where he belongs! You can see every time he plays in the middle now he is disappointing, obviously because hasn't had enough time practicing and playing there all year.

Amauri is simply an inhumanly mediocre striker who was extremely lucky to play the best football of his life at the right time, causing idiot Secco to dump boatloads of money on him.

He possesses the right physique required of a top notch striker but his skill set is average while his mind seems to be frail and not cut out for playing at the highest level or producing consistently. He relies a ton on confidence and his confidence has been lost for over a year now, it ain't coming back anytime soon.

Buying a 28 year old striker who has never scored more than 15 goals a season in his career for 20+ million was stupid (Secco…).

As for the VS gurus, nothing lately about Gilardino. The last 'guru confession' says that Juve have been following Andrea Mantovani of Chievo for 2+ months and Beppe has made an official inquiry for him. Fiorentina are also interested in him and have promised Juve freedom in trying to sign Ziegler (they are also interested in him) if Juve leave the Mantovani race.

Chievo v. Juventus: End It With A Bang,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 18, 2010, 3:30pm PST",,"Ok, observations from the first half:

1) A tactical observation: we are constantly shifting the play to the left, and then overloading there. Aquilani and Quagliarella play close to Grosso and Pepe, while Krasic moves to the center. This happened so many times that it's clearly a studied tactical move. Delneri probably realizes that opponents are going to be very careful with Krasic from now on, and devised a way to deal with it by overloading them on the opposing flank. If they react to this by putting more men there, Krasic gets the empty spaces he does the most damage in. Well-thought, Delneri, well-thought.

2) The youngsters are a bit shaky, but despite a few mistakes, I'm very hopeful, especially about Sorensen.

3) The rhythm between Quagliarella and Krasic is excellent, I wish Iaquinta had more of that natural thing.

4) Aquilani is working hard, and wherever there's a close call in midfield, or wherever Chievo players outnumber ours, he is the man I want to see because he knows how to get the ball out, when to pass it, and where to pass it.

5) Kudos to Storari for that excellent save. Few penalties are really saved, they're mostly missed or not well-shot, but this one I feel, was saved.",juvealways ,"Dec 19, 2010 ", 11:57 AM,

Sorensen has to constrain Constant, and he really is a hell of player when in-form, with Pellisier as well dropping to the left sometimes. Not an easy task for him, with Krasic moving more centrally when defending.",Robee ,"Dec 19, 2010 ", 11:59 AM,

Iaquinta is a decent striker who ideally, deserves to be the 4th striker for a team like Juve, maybe 3rd if he could stay healthy. He's not horrible but he's nothing better than a Michele Padovano.

Amauri is an ok striker who ideally, deserves to be the 5th striker for a team like Juve, maybe 4th. I don't rate him any higher than a Daniel Fonseca/Marcelo Zalayeta etc.

Chievo v. Juventus: End It With A Bang,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 18, 2010, 3:30pm PST",,"let's start with the main conclusion from today game:
WE HAVE SERIOUS LACK OF GOALSCORER! IF WE SIMPLY PUT THESE 2 OPPORTUNITIES ONE ON ONE 100% IN WE DON'T have to cry right now and to blame somebody. Accept the reality- Iaquinta is not finisher neither Krasic.
Apart of this i can blame only one person – The referee!
Bad call for the penalty, bad call for the red card (which changed the game).
We honestly made a good game having in mind the injuries for today.
I see the light IMO, i can say that even Grosso look decent today.Sorensen made a bad start but later get in the game better. Giandonatto is young and we all knew that he will not manage today. Anyway, we are still in the race but the thing which bother me is that we are not able to win easily against this calibre teams which definitely is not bring scudetto yo us.I do believe Milan is not the team to look out, we need to look out Lazio,Roma, Napoli and Palermo behind us – they will be in better position soon if we don't win. Yes we are unbeaten but what will do with these all draws – to be contender we need to WIIIIINNN!
Positive game – don't forget we played 10 for the first time and we almost did it, lack of orientation in the last seconds but God give us 3 against Lazio and God took it today in final seconds.
Anyway, We are still in the top so expect more positive results with 2-3 addition.

-Juve need a striker more than anything else in the January transfer market. Pazzini should be their main target. Iaquinta as I was saying before I left was a waste of time and I return and he still plays like a bag of garbage. No killer instinct at all, Juve can't be considered serious title contenders with him as our main prima punta.

- What i've heard throughout the season is the Krasic, Quagliarella, Aquilani, Cheillini, Storari, Pepe and Melo have been playing brilliant for Juve. That's what I like to here.

- Where is King Alex Del Piero? he already retired? lol

- We have shown we are good enough in defense and we don't have any European fixture to contend with (idk how they manage to crash out of the EL with 6 draws but it's ok i'm not sweating that competition anyways). A top class finisher is a must to partner Quagliarella and King Krasic in attack.

While we are all disappointing about the draw today which stole second place going into the break, we really need to remember what the goal was at the beginning of the season. Although many people were doubting that this Juve with these players and this coach would make it to a cl spot, its now winter break and were sitting just 5 points behind milan (and its not like we have europe to worry about).
Halfway through this season things arent looking too bad, especially if you consider the way our performances have been (steadily) improving, compared with last year by this point at which we were blowing hot and cold. Im just waiting for marotta to come out and say what the goal is for the rest of the season. If were simply planning on qualifying for the cl as before, having a transition year, and waiting for the new stadium, fourth place is reachable.
But the thing is that the the top of the table and the s****** are close and there is very very very little that is missing from this squad. Sure, the team is not “world class”, but looking at the state of the seria a this year, all that is missing is just that one player who could add a few points here and there, be it a striker who could score a few more goals than the rock (amauri) or a fullback who would be able provide more support in the back and offer more options going forward.
Despite the fact that the early comments regarding the winter mercato from marotta arent all that reasuring, im hoping that the board take some time over the holidays to think about what this juve can really accomplish this year.

You put in Marchiso and Melo in that game and everything changes. The decision would have been better, aqua would not have had to drop down as deep and over compensate for the youngster growing pains. So we can feel a sense of calmness that if we had all the pieces together the outcome would have probably been a little different.

Just saying.

Furthermore, Pepe is playing amazing. He played some great defense, covered plenty of ground, provided some calmness and tempo to the game. I was always a fan and now i find myself really pulling for the guy. Storari was on form tonight as well. Buffon is un replaceable but this man with the 1980's haircut is playing rock solid for our beloved Juve. It seems as though he has a great connection with his defense they are always smiling, talking together and it shows on the pitch.

First of that was the semi-juve Melo and Marchisio were missing and that´s a BIG missing. Krasic is awesome, the guy plays with 2 sometimes 3 players breathing at his neck all the time, and still manages too give it all. Pepe is really starting to get to my good side, since the Fiorentina goal. Sorensen is young, but has a lot of potential. I didn´t liked the changes, but realized they were forced because of the red card, which was correcto.

I'm not singling your specific post out or anybody else on here but we (Juventus fans in general) have never been whiny, paranoid, complexed f****** like intertristi and can't allow ourselves to become like them.

Do I think Serie A is corrupt? Of course but I don't believe every official steps on the pitch with a clear, ill-intentioned plan of doing everything in his power to favor one team while making the other team's experience a nightmare.

Due to the farce known as Calciopoli however, I do believe that there exists a “Juventus are the source of all evil in calcio, maximal awareness needed when dealing with them due to their previous, Moggi-era conniving ways”-mentality all over Italy. This has led to Juventus continuously being collectively frowned upon at the slightest suspicion of a possible irregularity while receiving exemplary punishment at times for fairly normal occurrences (see Krasic's dive VS Bologna and the shitstorm that ensued).

We were, after all, merely rebuilding after a terrible season. Losses to Bari and Palermo, and a draw against Sampdoria, and I was sure we wouldn't qualify for the CL. I didn't totally blame Delneri; at that point, most of my anger and frustration were aimed at Marotta's ridiculous transfer decisions – a Martinez who doesn't fit a 4-4-2, a lack of a proper striker, not selling Amauri, not buying a new LB, getting rid of Giovinco and Trezeguet, and us buying the worst player from WC 2010, one Simone Pepe.

Generations Of White & Black,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 17, 2010, 4:34pm PST",,"A lovely, heart warming story…but more important to me, is how promising our youngsters really are?

In relation to what was mentioned in the enjoyable to listen to as always podcast…if we all agree that our major problems are these:
Lack of a prima punta- Vinny Cenzo is a battering ram, who when fit, will score goals, but nowhere near to the rate of our unfortunately departed Trezegol. Amauri is injured, and I agree with the main centre point of the podcasts…Aaron? in that Amauri, is deadweight, and has had so many chances now, and proven only, that he is awful. We are not talking about a bad period, we are talking about 18 months of patheticness. He simply should never be allowed to don the beautiful bianconeri maglia ever again. Its great to have optimism, but for those who still believe he can come back to fitness and do the business…that seems to me, more lunacy, than objective optimism. He managed 5 goals in 30+ games last season, and when he has played this season, he has shown zero threat to goal. I was one of those who was optimistic at the start of the season. Reverting to 4-4-2, would surely present so many chances for a player who even with shocking feet, has shown talent in the air previously…but alas…no. Still wretched.

Left Back- De ceglie was looking much improved before his injury, and I have hope that he can return to such levels of output on the field, when he returns. Especially with the definitely more defensive Marchisio in front of him. Perhaps I could be happy with Grosso as a backup. But would prefer to see the former world cup winner put out to pasture. As ideally, we want TWO decent players fighting for every position. Competition is healthy. Assuredness of first team selection, for any player, is unhealthy.

Right back-
Sorensen has been absolutely wonderful. A real gem in the rough, and whoever scouted him, and made the decision to have him on loan, patriaci?? should be praised. With Grygera returning to fitness, and like Sorensen, much happier to provide mainly defensive cover, im less concerned as i was a few months back, about the right back position.

Regista-
A position Ciro made a huge mistake in asking Big Phil Melo to play last season, has been finally, after many years now needing improvement, found its saviour, in Aquilani, whose defensive prowess has astounded me. Against Lazio, Hernanes was a ghost, and not only shackling their main man, but also getting several decent efforts on target from a fair range…Alberto is indeed proving to be wonderful for our team. Now with a player so prone to injuries over recent years, and becoming increasingly pivotal to our play, he needs a backup…which presently is who???? Nobody. Its essential that we have another player in the squad capable of playing that role. Yes, Krasic is a demon, at times, completely unplayable, but we are clearly a better team when our attacking thrusts can come from more places than just the right flank…

The rest of the team seems fine. We have Pepe, Lanzafame (although I reckon he will go out on loan in January, as he is fit now, and not even making the bench) and the soon to return Martinez (who NOBODY can yet judge as to his suitability to the left flank, as he simply hasn't played enough).

Quag can ably share the prima punta role with Vinny Cenzo…and also, as I would prefer to see, take DP's spot, and play alongside, lower in the lineup, with our battering ram.

Add to this the blossoming partnership of CHiellini and Bonucci, and we are really looking rather decent.

Of the areas I highlighted, most important to me, is a decent prima punta, and even more essentially, a decent backup/challenger to Aquiliani…

Do we have these players in our primavera?

Other than that…does anyone know anything about our apparent signing of Lucas Piazon? And if so…also…who is he?? does he have the option of an italian passport???",thegutterpoet ,"Dec 18, 2010 ", 4:29 AM,

He took part in 2009 in the South American U15 championship in Bolivia, 10 goals in 7 games and won top goalscorer.

look at it, your defence/midfield consist of players over 30 years of age, i.e pirlo, nesta, zambrotta, seedorf, gattuso, oddo. just to name a few. they're finished buddy, i don't think they'll last another season, but time will tell. as you saw with inzaghi, when you get injured and your of some age, it is very hard to heal up to your potential. (no disrespect to pippo, he is a legend along with most of the 06' world cup winners in the squad) i must say, you have an impressive line of offence, but it'll take more than pato-ibra-robinho and dinho to get the scudetto. what happens when all the 'pensioners' start to tire, injure and faulter? you think ibra can just get it from the defence and run past the whole team? no way mate. so just think about what you say before coming onto this board and mouth off, why did you think we beat you? we're a young, strong, passionate side who even with the injuries we had managed to beat the 'retirement home of milan'

Reports of Cassano going to AC Milan keep popping up. That can go one of two ways, he strenghtens an already strong team and is content switching with Seedorf and Boateng. for the trequartista role or with Robinho for the second striker role. If this is the case then it is going to be tough for us to beat Milan to the scudetto.

The other option is: Cassano wants a starting spot and he tries very hard, Allegri gives it to him and causes problems with the rest of his teammates. Given the number of forwards or CAM that Milan has, I think this scenario is more likely. Robinho, Ronaldinho, Pato, KPB, and Seedorf play in a position where Cassano can possibly play. With the exception of KPB I don't know if any of the others will just sit back and be ok with this.

I think Juve was a place where Cassano could thrive, I don't know if Milan is.

The other thing that baffles me is when are they going to stop buying forwards. It is just like us when we bought every possible mediocre defensive midifileder on the face of the earth. Kudos to Galliani, he has bought great players, not mediocre ones, but great players come with ego, and great players come with a desire to play and that can be more costly on the pitch that having mediocre players.

If it is true, I say, Juve's chances are not diminished by this, Juve needs to worry about Juve and win all the games we have left. I am sure that this tournament won't come down to the return match against Milan therefore one squad strengthening doesn't affect us that much, it is not like Cassano is going to play in all other 19 teams in the league except for Juve. What I do hope is that if this rumor is indeed true, and if we win against Chievo that our management buy mindfully to make our squad better, and if they can't then just leave it as is. Right now I am sure Allegri is trying to figure out whether this is a good thing or not, while Delneri can go to bed happy that we tied against Man. City and learned lots about ourselves.",Jose ,"Dec 16, 2010 ", 10:23 PM,

After watching the Lazio game and listening to the podcast I started to think how this Juve could be right now if De Ceglie wouldn't have injured himself. He was starting to defend decently and his crosses are excellent. Compare that to Grosso who doesn't know what he is doing in defense and whose crosses are not quite Molinaro style but poor for the most part.

I want Juve to try Traore on Thursday and for 45 minutes on Sunday. If he convinces then he should be our starter, if not then we should go for Ziegler who I believe will be head and shoulder over who we have now in that position.

As for the forward, it is a hard debate. I think Benzema will score a lot of goals but I don't know if he will be good for this locker room. If we get him I hope it is on a 6-month loan and that we send him packing in June. Amauri for Gilardino will be a dream come true but is Corvino that insane?.",Jose ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 11:26 AM,

on another note, i found something that i found infinitely interesting last night on wikipedia. the article for catenaccio included the following paragraph while discussing the zona mista. check it out: “The most famous example of Zona Mista was the Italian team playing in the 1982 FIFA World Cup Final. Classy and skillful Gaetano Scirea was the libero, the then 18-years old Giuseppe Bergomi the holding midfielder, and Fulvio Collovati and tough tackling Claudio Gentile the centre backs. As the system required, Gentile who was normally a fullback extended his defensive cover wide to the right; sometimes Gentile and Orialli switched their roles (when Gentile man-marked Maradona) – Gentile as holding midfielder, Orialli – as right centre-back. Gabriele Oriali played right (often central, holding) midfielder, Marco Tardelli centre midfielder and Bruno Conti the playmaker. True to the call of his role, Conti played an instrumental role in Italy's win. He was a central figure in Italy's second goal that was scored by Tardelli and single-handedly created Italy's third goal by breaking down the right side from the half-way line and crossing to Alessandro Altobelli, who came on as an early substitute for the injured Francesco Graziani (left forward), to score from the top of the box. To complete the roster, Paolo Rossi played the other forward position and Antonio Cabrini was on the left wing as wingback.” – from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C…

Now I know that its not fair to compare our current squad with one of the best italian sides ever assembled but doesnt this type of system seem to be PERFECTLY well suited given our current players? while leo is not scirea (RIP), i think he could fill that same role aptly; playing with one fullback that is more of a central and defensive player a la Gentile (sorenson anyone?); cabrini role filled by De Ceglie/Traore/Pepe/whoever we have fit to play wingback; marchisio filling in where Tardelli was; Aquaman for Conti as playmaker; Melo as holding midfielder a la Bergomi; Milos MF'in Krasic on the wing with offensive responsibilities like Orialli; Quags and Vincenzo (or if another prima is purchased) up top like Altobelli and Rossi.

Now I understand that im taking this a bit far, but it seems like the abilities of each player are PERFECT for these roles and this kind of tactic (slight alteration on a 4-4-2 that we already seem to be undertaking) would not take too much coaching or learning curve. The best part? our squad only needs to add a prima if the players are in these positions in order to become a phenomenal squad! what do you guys think?",dweb ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 12:38 PM,

I will even give Fiorentina 1m for their troubles, certainly no more. On that note, Is Corvino that insane? I don't think so.

With Amauri's huge salary off our backs we can think Dzeko in the summer, who just as you said Jorid is who I want starting in the black and white next year.

So with us looking bfor a lw, what do we do with archisio? He's Far too talented to be on the bench. Personally what I think we should do is very simple, forget a left winger, and go for a very attacking wingBACK, such as maggio, vargas, or hoefully contento. Then wed have aCrooked 442 with quags and a new fenter forward up front, with a defensive left midfielder (marchisio) and an offensive left back (contento) on the left side, and then an offensive right midfielder (krasic) and defensive right back (tasci). That would work well. And with archisio as the left midfielder, quags has filled in as the eft winher for counterattacks where marchisio and the left back ave been or will be busy. Marchisio can also move to thr center when auilani or melo are out, and then we should buy a simlar playrr to marchisio like ivan rakitic to fill in on he left while martinez can fill in for krasic, del piero can fill in for quags, etc. I think we hould go for a striker in january, as well as contento, and then go for rakitic and tasci at the end of the season when pepe and mottas loans run out.",Armando ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 9:24 PM,

Podcast- Milos Milos Krasic! Krasic!,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 11:53pm PST",,"I posted this on the Juventus podcast site in the comments section, but I'll post it again here too. I added to what I said anyway lol:

Great job, guys! My thoughts on why Grosso is so often out of position is possibly because Delneri has given him much more freedom to push forward. Sorensen almost plays as a third CB rather than a RB, so it’s almost like a back 3 at times. And because Marchisio often moves into the center, Grosso is usually the one providing width on left. So I think he simply just isn’t given as much defensive responsibilities….which is a good thing because we all know he’s not great defensively. If we do come across a team that wants to exploit Grosso’s defensive weakness or exploit the gaps in that area, one of Chiellini or Marchisio is going to be helping cover that area. Grosso obviously does need to improve defensively when he is asked to defend though. And his offensive contribution has been poor as well. He’s obviously been below average and needs to be sold, but I don’t think he’s been awful when you consider what his actual responsibilities during the game are. But he definitely needs to go because he does suck lol.

Regarding a striker, I’m kind of torn on what Juve should do in January. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to bring someone in on loan providing they don’t have a huge salary. I totally understand where Aaron is coming from because I think Quagliarella and Del Piero will rotate at seconda punta, and Iaquinta and at the moment Amauri rotate at prima punta. But anyone Juve bring in will probably be better than Amauri. The question is though, will they be significantly better that it’s worth investing money that could instead by spent for someone better in the summer. If it’s someone that requires a significant investment like Gilardino probably would, then that would jeopardize our chances of making a big signing (like Dzeko) in the summer as we wouldn’t have as much money available, but he would help us significantly right now…and he’d be good in the future as well. If its a cheaper option like say Crespo or Di Vaio (just to use him as an example), then yeah, he would come for cheap and is better than Amauri. It might be worth the investment (especially if Iaquinta picks up an injury), but it might not. And since he’s only a short term solution, its kind of a waste in that sense as he doesn’t help the team’s future. But if we can bring in a striker on loan and at the same time manage to sell off Amauri, then I don't see how that's a bad thing. And Marotta was prepared to bring in Di Natale this summer, so older players aren’t necessarily off limits (granted, Di Natale has a very good goal scoring record in Serie A and is pretty much a guaranteed goal scorer, so we can’t compare him to Di Vaio).

Signing someone like Matri (which might be achievable for a good price if we give up Ariaudo and/or Lanzafame) would be a longer term solution. If he puts in solid performances when he plays, he could replace Iaquinta in the starting 11. He’s no Dzeko, but he’s young and there is plenty of room to grow. He would fit Juve’s project and I don’t see the harm in signing him. Sure, he might not make a huge contribution as he’s not significantly better than anyone we have (other than Amauri of course), but he’d be a long term player that would develop. And if Juve go on to buy Dzeko in the summer to replace Amauri, they could sell Iaquinta too and keep Matri. It follows Juve’s policy of renewing the squad.

The best thing would be if Juve manage to sell Amauri in January. If they can sell Amauri in January, how is bringing someone else in (especially on loan), going to waste money? If the player brought on loan has a smaller salary than Amauri, then it may actually SAVE us money.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 11:37 PM,
Podcast- Milos Milos Krasic! Krasic!,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 11:53pm PST",,"Regarding Trezeguet’s sale, I think there were a few different factors. One was that he’s said on numerous occasions that he wanted to end his career closer to family. By playing in his wife’s hometown, he’s doing that now. Another factor was that at least one striker needed to be offloaded this summer. I’d much rather have had Amauri been the one sold, but it wouldn’t have been easy to find a solution that would have satisfied Amauri and convince him to leave. But Trezeguet and his agent found a solution that they liked, so it ended up that he was the one let go. Could Trezeguet have been convinced to stay? Yeah, but we’d still have the problem of having to offload a striker. Delneri reassured Trez that he would have been a part of his plans, but Trez still chose to leave. He made a decision and we should all respect it. I don’t think he was forced out. Marotta wasn’t actively negotiating with teams for his sale like he did for Diego. Trez and his agent were the ones that proposed Hercules. If Trez wanted to end his career in bianconero then him and his agent would have worked something out with Agnelli and Marotta and made it happen. Del Piero obviously doesn’t want to sit on the bench, but when he does, it won’t make him want to leave the club. Trez doesn’t want to sit on the bench either, but he decided it was time to move on somewhere where he would be a guaranteed starter every game. I respect that decision. Should Trez be starting ahead of Iaquinta and Amauri? Yes. And I think if he stuck around that he would have earned a starting spot on the team. But he decided to move on.

Oh and obviously Trezeguet could have helped significantly this season, but we didn’t know the title race would be wide open. We assumed that the strikers we had would be enough to reach our objective of a Champions League spot, and that the money we saved from offloading a striker could be reinvested in the team next summer. And for that purpose, offloading a striker was important. And I already mentioned in my previous post why Trezeguet was the striker that was sacrificed. As far as we know, there were no opportunities to offload Amauri, and there were no destinations that Amauri was happy with.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 11:44 PM,

Podcast- Milos Milos Krasic! Krasic!,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 11:53pm PST",,"The King of Pop has been spotted in some unusual places since he died last year – at a port in Norway, building an underground bunker in Australia – but this sighting really took the biscuit. On Sunday night in front of some 20,000 fans at Turin's Stadio Olimpico – and many more watching on TV – Michael Jackson went dancing down the right side of the area, cut inside and clipped over a cross that Fernando Muslera would palm into his own net for the decisive goal in Juventus's 2-1 win over Lazio.


That, at least, is how Milos Krasic's friends back in Mitrovica would tell it. “It's a nickname they gave me when I was seven or eight years old,” explained the Serbian winger to Italian reporters shortly after joining Juventus. “They said my style of football was like a dance by the great Michael.”

If no one want amauri, why dont we just promote Libertazzi to the senior level? give him playing time and who knows he will turn into our 2nd sorensen. I agree with aaron in anybody is better than amauri, but bring in a new striker while amauri is still on the team is not a long term solution.

Podcast- Milos Milos Krasic! Krasic!,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 11:53pm PST",,"2 (pretty exciting) rumors:

-According to various Italian media, Juve are finalizing a deal for Lucas Piazon of Sao Paolo. He's a '94 (!!!), 182cm tall already, heavily linked with Chelsea and Milan for 1.5+ years, dubbed 'the new Kaka' by many scouts/Brazilian pundits due to him looking like Ricky's clone pretty much(same position, same club, same physique, same style of play, same f'n hair lol). He took part in 2009 in the South American U15 championship in Bolivia, 10 goals in 7 games and won top goalscorer. It would be a Pato/Coutinho type of move since he's not even 17 yet and it would cost ~6 million.

I have not seen him play. From what I keep on reading around though, he's pretty talented. Also, on FM11 he's a monster, that's gotta count for something, right? Daniels: your input in regards to Piazon would be great.

-Perhaps the better of the two rumors, Giorgio Perinetti, Siena's current sporting director, when asked what he predicted was going to be the big January mercato move in Italy said: “Juventus are going to make the biggest move come January, they are going to insist for Pazzini because they want a striker at all costs. I think the deal is going to be completed successfully and it will be a great move for Juventus.”

Perinetti is not just a nobody in terms of calcio knowledge. He's a lifelong Moggi friend, after having worked with Luciano as a director of Napoli during the Maradona period and he even held the position of head of the youth sector at Juve from '98-'00, once again working alongside Luciano.

He was the sporting director of Bari from '07 to May '10, when he quit that position and became the Siena DS. He's one of the people responsible for Bari's resurgence 3 years ago in B, their promotion to A and even their very successful season last year.

I just got excited as fuck for the winter mercato lol.",jorid22 ,"Dec 16, 2010 ", 2:52 AM,

Chiellini should man mark him and we should be ok. The main thing about this team is that besides having a good defense the attack is starved from the midfield, Aquilani, Marchisio, and Melo really cut out a good chunk of the play in the middle and that leaves the strikers having to track back or the other teams' midfielders having to try the long pass which a tall defense can cope with easily.",Jose ,"Dec 16, 2010 ", 3:02 AM,

Do I think Garrone wants to leave his Samp with no Pazzo after pretty much kicking out Cassano for the rest of the season? Nope but money talks and ~20 million will make Garrone wrap Pazzini nicely in time for La Befana to drop him off to Torino lol. Also, like Papai once again mentioned, Andrea made it clear last week that if the club believes there is a chance of silverware this year and there is good/reasonable deals around that would improve our above mentioned chances, Juve will spend.

It's a good opportunity to test him, though playing Motta would also make sense.

I imagine that Sissoko, Lanzafame and Pepe will all play. Up front who knows. Iaquinta might have picked up a knock against Lazio. Quags isn't on the UEFA list.

Photos Slash Line-Ups Slash Injury Updates,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 9:59am PST",,"Anyone read Ciro Ferrara's comments about Juve recently? He said he believes this Juve is equal to his Juve last season because they have the same amount of points in the table.

""The statistics say Juventus have as many points now as they did at this time last season,"" noted Ferrara.

Ferrara should know better than to just look at the amount of points Juve have though. Juve's performances have been much better this year. And while they started the season shaky, they've improved steadily. Last year Juve started strongly, but steadily declined. That was a combination of many factors obviously. Secco didn't build the team properly, and Ferrara didn't have the same type of support from the management that Agnelli and Marotta have given to Delneri. That surely had to contribute to the player's loss of morale and Juve's lack of character last season.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 2:26 AM,

Traore is our only option at LB unless we play Pepe there (Grosso and Brazzo not on the list). Grygera played well at RB before he was injured, this is a good opportunity to see if he can pick up where he left off. I don't mind playing Motta though.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 2:18 AM,

Juve are also Serie A's highest scoring team at the moment, and our defense has been steadily improving. And just the fact that Juve give their all to the end of every match this season says enough. Last year they used to give up as soon as they'd concede a goal, which is why the fans got so restless last year.

Photos Slash Line-Ups Slash Injury Updates,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 9:59am PST",,"Great job on the podcast as usual!

My thoughts on why Grosso is so often out of position is possibly because Delneri has given him much more freedom to push forward. Sorensen almost plays as a third CB rather than a RB, so it's almost like a back 3 at times like you guys said. And because Marchisio often moves into the center, Grosso is usually the one providing width on left. So I think he simply just isn't given as much defensive responsibilities….which is a good thing because we all know he's not great defensively. If we do come across a team that wants to exploit Grosso's defensive weakness or exploit the gaps in that area, one of Chiellini or Marchisio is going to be helping cover that area. Grosso obviously does need to improve defensively when he is asked to defend though. And his offensive contribution has been poor as well. He's obviously been below average and needs to be sold, but I don't think he's been awful when you consider what his actual responsibilities during the game are.

Regarding a striker, I'm kind of torn on what Juve should do in January. I don't think it's unreasonable to bring someone in on loan providing they don't have a huge salary. I totally understand where Aaron is coming from because I think Quagliarella and Del Piero will rotate at seconda punta, and Iaquinta and at the moment Amauri rotate at prima punta. But anyone Juve bring in will probably be better than Amauri. The question is though, will they be significantly better that it's worth investing money that could instead by spent for someone better in the summer. If it's someone that requires a significant investment like Gilardino probably would, then that would jeopardize our chances of making a big signing (like Dzeko) in the summer as we wouldn't have as much money available, but he would help us significantly right now…and he'd be good in the future as well. If its a cheaper option like say Di Vaio (just to use him as an example), then yeah, he would come for cheap and is better than Amauri, but how many goals would he realistically score? It might be worth the investment (especially if Iaquinta picks up an injury), but it might not. And since he's only a short term solution, its kind of a waste in that sense as he doesn't help the team's future. But Marotta was prepared to bring in Di Natale this summer though, so older players aren't necessarily off limits (granted, Di Natale has a very good goal scoring record in Serie A and is pretty much a guaranteed goal scorer, so we can't compare him to Di Vaio).

Signing someone like Matri (which might be achievable for a good price if we give up Ariaudo and/or Lanzafame) would be a longer term solution. If he puts in solid performances when he plays, he could replace Iaquinta in the starting 11. He's no Dzeko, but he's young and there is plenty of room to grow. He would fit Juve's project and I don't see the harm in signing him. Sure, he might not make a huge contribution as he's not significantly better than anyone we have, but he'd be a long term player that would develop. And if Juve go on to buy Dzeko in the summer to replace Amauri, they could sell Iaquinta too and keep Matri. It follows Juve's policy of renewing the squad.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 4:10 AM,

Photos Slash Line-Ups Slash Injury Updates,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 14, 2010, 9:59am PST",,"Regarding Trezeguet's sale, I think there were a few different factors. One was that he's said on numerous occasions that he wanted to end his career closer to family. By playing in his wife's hometown, he's doing that now. Another factor was that at least one striker needed to be offloaded this summer. I'd much rather have had Amauri been the one sold, but it wouldn't have been easy to find a solution that would have satisfied Amauri and convince him to leave. But Trezeguet and his agent found a solution that they liked, so it ended up that he was the one let go. Could Trezeguet have been convinced to stay? Yeah, but we'd still have the problem of having to offload a striker. Delneri reassured Trez that he would have been a part of his plans, but Trez still chose to leave. He made a decision and we should all respect it. I don't think he was forced out. Marotta wasn't actively negotiating with teams for his sale like he did for Diego. Trez and his agent were the ones that proposed Hercules. If Trez wanted to end his career in bianconero then he would do what Del Piero has been doing, and that is signing 1 year contract extensions with a reduced salary because he understands that the team need to renew, and paying a large salary for someone who is not in the long term plans is not smart business. Del Piero obviously doesn't want to sit on the bench, but he can accept it and it won't make him want to leave the club. Trez doesn't want to sit on the bench either, but instead of accepting it like Del Piero, he decided it was time to move on somewhere where he would be a guaranteed starter every game. I respect that decision.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 4:30 AM,

And for that purpose, offloading a striker was important. And I already mentioned in my previous post why Trezeguet was the striker that was sacrificed.",Anthony ,"Dec 15, 2010 ", 4:40 AM,
