While it's true that the damage is done, calciopoli could be (I said could be) a blessing in disguise. Yes we were dominating serie A but we're simply not good enough in Champions League. To make things worse, the squad's avg age was getting larger and larger. It was only a matter of time before we lost our hold on the serie A summit.

Then bam! Calciopoli arrived and we're forced to enter a rebuilding mode. Yes there were risks like we didn't win anything for a period of time and the direction could take a wrong turn (like the last couple of years had proven) but also we get to reduce our behemoth salaries and our squad's avg age.

This year, I believe we're on the right track and next season world class players will arrive to strengthen our your core. We'll also be playing in our brand new money-making stadia and with the money flowing, we'll have the most advantage with the new UEFA financial regulation (which states that clubs can only spend as much as they earn) which will take affect starting from the 2012 season.

With Milan having issues with astronomical salaries and squad's avg age and decaying stadia, Roma with the changing of ownerships imminent, those scumbags black-and-blue will also be having Milan's issues in the near future, we'll be dominating serie A again starting from the 2012 season.

All in all, we lost six years (2006-2012) and 2 scudetti (which we'll take back once the new 171,000 wiretaps evidence were analyzed) to farsepoli and the rebuilding mode; and when we start winning in 2012, it's a small price to pay.",dwicarta ,"Sep 18, 2010 ", 2:19 AM,

“Blessing in disguise”?? Really!! Good grief, no one enjoys pushing the “New Game” button in Sim Meier's Civilization more than me (as soon as my nation isn't working 100% as I would like it, I start over… lame I know). But to think that at its apogee, Juventus needed to be demolished in order to be rebuilt from scratch… well that is just madness.

The truth is, Calciopoli not only decimated our first team by taking away half its most talented players (we can hate Cannavaro, Zambrotta, Zlatan etc. etc. all we want, but the truth is when they left in 2006 they were world-class elements who just had won a Scudetto and who for the most part, would go on to win the FIFA World Cup); It not only severely damaged our image (something which, when tarnished, takes a very long time to recover its polish); it not only hit us hard in the nads in terms of financial losses (not only Champions League TV rights, but also those of Serie A).

Nay, the damage ran for more deep. What truly hit us the hardest post-Calciopoli, was the damage done on the echelons of upper management, the very heart & motor of the club operating machinery, and this was a type of damage which only today we are starting to recover from.

All of a sudden, Moggi, Giraudo, Bettega were gone, and we were left with Secco & Blanc. A trio of all-powerful, intelligent, shrewd individuals who knew every bit and piece of running a football team were replaced by a sad bunch of incompetents, who moved us forward inches (Blanc's financial work, some of Secco's transfer) only to set us back miles in the next stroke (Blanc's club management, and as for Secco his work clearly speaks for itself). I am not telling a joke when I say and believe our post-Calciopoli management set Juve further back than the actual scandal ever did.

So 4 years later, to say that all of this was a small price to pay so that we could enter “rebuilding mode” I'm sorry, that just sounds like utter insanity to me.",Marco P. ,"Sep 18, 2010 ", 3:14 AM,

Now, tell me when you saw our games before 2006 you can honestly say we didn't get favorable calls? Sure some were dubiously called against us but we DID get more favorable calls more than other teams. Nothing more clearer than when Iuliano held Ronaldo and we weren't punished for a penalty.

I'm not saying calciopoli is fair to us. It's not fair at all. In fact I agree with Moggi when he said that either everyone was guilty or everyone was innocent. In my opinion all teams have contacts with officials. Some more than the others because, well, some have more powers than the others. When the avvocato passed away, that scumbag owner of the scumbags black-and-blue seized more power and voila! Calciopoli.

What I'm saying is that:
1. Calciopoli was inevitable and we had to work with what we have, and off course, tried to get as many advantage as we could from the dire situation; and
2. The whole system is corrupt. All teams (and their owners) should not be able to influence officials. The regulations must be clear about it and then those regulations must be upheld and upheld fairly to all teams.

Once the playingfield is fair, serie A will be cleaner and as a result, quantitatively and qualitatively better.

I agree the post-calciopoli management, the blanc and secco era, set us back further by making disastrous sporting decisions but they did make us healthy financially. Also, it's only fair if the judges find in the new 171,000 new wiretap evidence that those scumbags black-and-blue did contact officials like we did, they must be relegated as well.

So, is calciopoli fair to us? No. Did we loose a short-term financial income and a five year sporting achievements? Yes. Did we loose our reputation? For the moment, yes. But if those scumbags black-and-blue are also caught, it will re repaired.

Is it a small price to pay to have a cleaner and fairer serie A games and therefore, better games? Yes.

And at the same time, is it a small price to pay to be way ahead in terms of financial opportunities and therefore, better chances to win consistently? You bet.",dwicarta ,"Sep 18, 2010 ", 7:01 AM,

Why ? First of all because the FIGC don't want to damage the image of Serie A any further and when they relegate or give any punishment what so ever to them, there will be many other teams to follow if they want justice. They won't let that happen. In this case it's rather everyone not guilty than the opposite…

Also, without Calciopoli, I don't think people like marchisio or giovinco would even have sniffed the first team, they would have been probably been loaned out or sold.

First of all… The Iaquinta sub
I was even surprised to see him on the pitch for about 80 minutes when all he has played is one little friendly at Vinovo and 15 mins this weekend after being out just how long ?
I would've thought and hoped our defence was strongh enough and taken off Iaquinta as well. The risk of a relapse in his thigh is just too big to take…

The start of Melo-Sissoko
Obviously for the same reasons… Aquilani is cup-tied and Marchisio just got fit for this weekend. He even had cramps at the end of the game. I was happy to not see him start the game.

The start of De Ceglie
Hmm with Traoré out and Delneri not wanting to rape Chiellini at left-back; who else was there to choose ? Rinaudo maybe, but that wouldn't have been better for our result as well…

On a different note: Please do not mention Caceres too many times. I can't take it anymore :). I simply love the guy, but it looked like he was too expensive after all…

All-in-all we should consider that many factors played a role in this game and this was simply put almost a reserves squad. Drawing at home against Poznan is not good at all, but we can still easily manage to go through.

Melo-Sissoko is just utterly stupid, I'd rather start Giandonato in one of their places because it simply doesn't work. A half-fit Marchisio would have been better than playing the two of them together.

I also agree on the “black hole” but starting Giandonato over Sissoko or Melo while they're both fit would definitely be the wrong signal while Delneri is so busy working on their confidence. We'll need them both this season, that's for sure. And a half-fit Marchisio is not a risk we want to take at this stage of course.

All I'm saying is I don't think the blame can be put on Delneri.

Take out a forward, bring in a defensive midfielder against a team that already put two goals in our net was only going to encourage the opposition. Bringing in Libertazzi would have put pressure on the CBs and prevented the last goal. Psychology more than tactics at that point.

With that being said, if Juve would have defended that last shot better or if the striker would have shot it over the crossbar no one would be talking about this now and we would all be praising the non molla mai attitude.

To me more than psychology, bringing in Marchisio confused the team, he didn't know where he was playing and that confused Krasic, Pepe, Melo, and Sissoko. Keeping the same formation (ie. bringing a striker for a striker) would have kept our team more focused.",Jose ,"Sep 17, 2010 ", 12:17 AM,

"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back: Juventus 3-3 Lech Poznan",The Offside Juventus,"Sep 16, 2010, 3:52pm PDT",,"Here is what the great man says

Probabilmente in pochi mi credono ma vedere la Juventus subìre tre gol in casa dal Lech Poznan (fino a ieri non sapevo neanche come si scrivesse) fa male. All'orgoglio juventino, ai ricordi che mi riportano alle sifde di Champions e agli scudetti vinti. A Tokyo per fare un esempio. Tre gol ieri, altri tre domenica scorsa con la Sampdoria. Mi sento come un leone in gabbia, se potessi aiuterei subito questa squadra che, per me, ha significato quasi tutta la mia esistenza calcistica. Lunedì sera, nel corso di “Notti Magiche” su Sportitalia, un tifoso, via internet, mi ha chiesto se fossi disponibile, un giorno, a rientrare nella Juve. Certo, è stata la mia risposta ma chi è al comando, tranne Andrea Agnelli, ha preferito fare piazza pulita e puntare sui volti nuovi che oggi sono presenti a Torino. La Juve va vissuta con cuore e anima. Come recita l'inno “Juve, storia di un grande amore”. Andiamo avanti, altrimenti la malinconia prevale sul commento calcistico. Zlatan Ibrahimovic si prende il Milan, non avevamo dubbi. La doppietta dello svedese ha sorpreso molti, specie quelli che dopo il difficile avvio di Cesena speravano, più che crederci davvero, che l'acquisto del bomber arrivato dal Barcellona potesse rivelarsi un buco nell'acqua. Erano pronti a sparare su Ibra e sul Milan che lo aveva acquistato. La voce di Moratti non si è fatta attendere: aveva definito sabato, il giorno perfetto per gli interisti. Durante la settimana il giorno perfetto dei rossoneri forse non è andato giù al Presidente. Lì dove Ibra ha segnato una volta si rivolgeva alla curva insultando i propri tifosi, oggi si becca baci e abbracci di tifosi e compagni. Berlusconi si tiene stretta la palma di assoluto re del mercato, con l'apporto del buon Adriano. I motivi per i quali il Presidente del Consiglio abbia deciso di riprendersi uno scettro che non era mai stato felice di lasciare, sono molteplici. I più importanti, a mio avviso, vanno ricercati nell'orgoglio di un vincente, stufo di essere ormai da troppo tempo il semplice sparring partner di un'Inter dominatrice in Italia ed in Europa. Con i due botti Ibra e Robinho, invece, Berlusconi è tornato ad essere l'idolo degli sportivi. E questo è importante per lui, sia sotto il profilo politico che sportivo. Vedrete che ne trarrà giovamento anche Ronaldinho: il brasiliano ormai gioca da fermo, ma Ibrahimovic gli aprirà spazi importanti per ritornare ad essere pericoloso quasi come un tempo.
Altri problemi, ben più seri, sono quelli che affronterà la Juventus. I bianconeri subiranno, e tanto, quando il centrocampo non sarà in grado di fare filtro. Con Melo non si fa un centrocampo, lui è una parte difensiva della mediana. Così non si costruisce niente e gli avversari continueranno ad arrivare uno contro uno, mettendo in grave difficoltà i difensori, che in realtà non hanno alcuna colpa. Oltretutto Bonucci e Chiellini non hanno capacità di recupero se sfugge un giocatore lanciato a rete, quindi è normale che si incontrino delle difficoltà. La composizione è sbagliata in partenza, non si può affiancare a Chiellini uno della sua stessa stazza. Della Juve ne ho parlato tutta l'estate e mi hanno criticato per aver avuto spesso una posizione contraria alle strategie di Beppe Marotta. Se dici che va tutto a gonfie vele non fai il bene del malato. Il malato va curato!
È anche per questo che vedo le milanesi come le favorite assolute di questo campionato, anche se devo ammettere che le accuse che il Milan ha rivolto alla classe arbitrale mi sono sembrate del tutto fuori luogo. Il Milan non dovrebbe attaccarsi a due-tre errori, a favore o contro, per vincere una partita: dovrebbe vincere e basta, come faceva la Juve nel passato e come ha fatto poi l'Inter negli ultimi anni. Da sempre gli arbitri sbagliano, a favore e contro. Oggi se ne accorgono tutti, quando lo sostenevo io era passata la favoletta che la Juve vinceva perchè avevamo più amici. Che ridere. la Juve vinceva perchè era in assoluto la più forte, come lo è stata l'Inter nelle ultime competizioni nazionali. È questione di mentalità, ed i nerazzurri l'hanno capito subito, tanto che alle prime avvisaglie hanno tenuto a mettere le mani avanti. Attenzione, quando reclameremo noi, non prendeteci in giro.
Proprio gli interisti, però, non riescono a convincermi del tutto. Credo che abbiano perso quel mordente che avevano l'anno scorso con Mourinho, manca la scintilla che ha permesso ai milanesi di primeggiare in tutta Europa pur non essendo la squadra più forte. A Benitez manca qualcosa. Lui non è Mourinho, in tutti i sensi. Il vantaggio che devono essere in grado di sfruttare, continua a derivare dalla pochezza delle avversarie: il Milan deve ancora essere assemblato mentre Juve e Roma sono guidate da due tecnici che si sono affrettati a chiamarsi fuori dalla corsa scudetto dopo nemmeno due partite. Inconcepibile buttare giù così il morale dei giocatori e della tifoseria.
La Roma ha bisogno di una svolta. Se avverrà quella societaria, sicuramente Unicredit cederà il club in mani buone ed affidabili. La scelta non sarà sbagliata.

It's a shame that a 36 year old Del Piero is still to pull the team through (3 goals for Alex in 4 EL games). Delneri kept Marchisio on for 90 mins against Sampdoria, he was just back from an injury.

However, if we look at the classic CB pairings over the years (Scirea-Gentlie, Cannavaro-Thuram etc), we can find that its always a partnership of the strong and the fast. However, I agree thats not the major problem facing Juventus right now. The biggest problems are, as you suggested

1) Lack of solid fullbacks – Marotta's first screw up – letting Caceres go
2) Lack of a ball playing CM – Secco's double cock up – Giving up D'Agostino and buying Melo
3) Marotta's BIGGEST Mistake – Selling Diego and Giovinco. At the time I thought (rather consoled myself) that selling Diego was some kind of tactical readjustment of the team, but now I realize that it was what it seemed at first – a colossal mistake. Its sad when our number one goal threat is our center back.

The defence is weak (we all know) and suffers from the same problems of the Ranieri era which is the counter attack. Why then are they playing so high up the field when only 10 minutes of the match have been played. Rudnevs first goal was on 13 min when we were caught scrambling back. We should set up for more defensively from the start, it may not be entertaining but we can't keep leaking goals (and at home). We don't have a true goal scorer or a regista, we have weak full backs and Melo/Sissoko. We need to accept this and know that if we are going to win we must not concede. The defence needs to play deeper especially early in the match and Motta and PDC need to stay back. Melo and Sissoko can't play together and so Marchisio and Aquilani must play besides them (fit or not) so that they can only concentrate on protecting the defence. They are not capable of doing anything else. If we can sort out the defence we can start building confidence and the play will start improving. The tempo was too slow in the beginning, it might be fatigue but we need to step up the pace.

I understand that there are budgetary constraints, but what I have a problem is with spending whatever dough we have on 2 mediocre players rather than one world class one. See, it is very evident from watching us play who the really good players are and who suck or are just plain average. The reason why Krasic is standing out so much is not only because he is a good player (which he undoubtedly is) but also because he is surrounded by very average players.

Squad depth is one thing, but it cannot come at the cost of compromising on the quality of our first team. Do you really really think that we are better off having Motta + Traore + Rinauldo rather than Ariaudo + Caceres??? Do you really think that we are better off having Lanza + Martinez + Quags rather than Giovinco + Diego? What Moggi says, and I agree, is that Marotta went for quantity rather than quality.

I dont want to flog a dead horse here, and I understand what is done is done, but isnt it necessary for us to objectively criticize what is turning out to be a potentially flawed mercato? As supporters of Juve, we get behind our beloved team no matter what happens. But then again, as the same supporter, we have the right to disagree with the direction our current DS is taking us, at least until the team manages to shut us all up with consistent performances and victories.

I do not wish to display Moggi fanboyism here – however, the reason Moggi gets so much attention from the press and from the supporters is that he built a winning team that was second to none in the whole world. I will not go into the whole farsopoli debate here, but suffice to say not only Marotta but any Juve DS will have to compete with the shadow of Moggi until we recapture our rightful place in calcio. It is the sad reality my friend – unfair to Marotta yes, but the world is not fair.",Papai ,"Sep 17, 2010 ", 9:15 AM,
"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back: Juventus 3-3 Lech Poznan",The Offside Juventus,"Sep 16, 2010, 3:52pm PDT",,"You definitely can criticise the direction, etc. etc. I'm not saying you should shut up or anything if that's what you thought ;).

Anyway with last year in mind I do think it was the best choice to go for squad depth instead of a quality injection. Especially with the injury flows surrounding our squad for a few years now…

I do think it makes sense to pay about 2.5M for Motta, Traoré and Rinauldo instead of 10-12 M for Caceres. About Giovinco and Ariaudo we need to be clear and say they really needed to go temporarily. If you see Alex play now you know it wouldn't have been good for Gio to stay and we discussed the Diego deal many times already. I stand by my point that he wouldn't have made any difference (yesterday).

You know it's unfair, but yet you're always posting this way and your opinion is respected so others take over that behaviour as well. It's not the time to cry over spoiled milk, we need to support our team and hope we get the train on the rails with 3 points this weekend.

Btw: We've done everything to create a new atmosphere at Juventus, with young directors, scouts, medical staff, president, even the players… Add Nedved and Alex next year and it'll all be fine. No need for a 73-yr old with a bad reputation there. I don't like the comparisons. Most here don't want to compare Krasic with Nedved, so why compare Marotta to Moggi ?

Fitness An Issue Ahead Of Lech Poznan?,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 15, 2010, 11:47am PDT",,"My two cents: I only watched the second half

The good:

- This team shows that they have more character than last year, they do not give up nearly as easy as last year and seem to be getting the coach's ideas better.
- King Giorgio is a beast, if his defending wasn't as good as it is he would make a better striker than Iaquinta, Amauri and probably Quagliarela.
- Del Piero, what a strike, devoted to defense and attack but not the Del Piero from two years ago, his years are showing.

The so so

- Krasic, lots of running but lacks vision sometimes, he needs more time to adjust, certainly lots of work on his wing but nothing spectacular, far from the next Nedved of course, but he has only played 3 games with our team.
-Melo and Sissoko. They have been long enough with this team specially Momo and their performances hover around mediocre to descent, far from the world class center midfield that most winning teams need and have
- Iaquinta, some good movement, the wings need to know what he is doing and where he is going, the understanding between Krasic, Pepe, and the forwards can only get better.
- Del Neri brought in Marchisio for Iaquinta, all that caused was great confusion in our team. With time they will understand more what he wants them to do but the problem is we are running out of time. Bringing in Marchisio for Iaquinta was logic in the sense that we needed to hold to our lead.

The bad, ugly, and disastrous

- The wings, Motta had a couple good plays but generally he was very poor, the fact that most of the attacks came from Motta's wing and not Grygera's shows how bad defensively Motta can be. I hope he gets better soon, the January transfer window might be too late to fix our right wing, oh Caceres, how much do I miss you!!!
- Our center midfield was horrible with three players. Melo, Sissoko, and Marchisio or Krasic whoever was playing in the center did not work at all. I am pretty sure that Marchisio was playing on the wing, why???… I don't understand, he is a CM and that is all he can do, a year ago he was labelled the next great CM of Italy, not the next winger, forward, or goalie… for crying out loud play him where he belongs and nowhere else, he is not a versatile player and that is fine. We gave the ball away more often with 5 midfielders than we did with two, simply ridiculous.
- The last goal is our midifields fault, simply ridiculous, at that point in the game we should have the ball as far away as possible from our goal.

Conclusion from this game? One of Melo and Sissoko must go next summer and be replaced by a defensive midfielder who can PASS THE BALL. We are going to have to improve significantly if we are to qualify for CL next year, if we don't make that objective then the harderst and longest our recovery will be.",Jose ,"Sep 16, 2010 ", 5:05 PM,

Fitness An Issue Ahead Of Lech Poznan?,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 15, 2010, 11:47am PDT",,"Jorid, you couldn't be more right. Chiellini saved us today and destroyed many more plays than anyone can ask for, if anyone has doubts rewatch the game and see that Chiellini tackles on the left wing, on the right wing and in the center of midfield. The guy is multiplying by 4. If we had a clone of Chiellini we wouldn't need fullbacks, and if we had two we wouldn't need a partner for ADP.

If you don't think Chiellini is good, heck, if you don't think Chiellini is a great defender then go watch poker on ESPN, you have little chance of understanding football.

The problem is team playing, Chiellini has three new players around him. Bonucci can be good but he is not great, at least not yet, and mostly he doesn't understand Chiellini yet. Motta, wow, I have faith in the kid but I am running out of arguments, he is bad, never mind bad, he is scary. PDC??, in the game against Sampdoria he started to look a little better, mostly because Cassano picked the right not because PDC scared Cassano from his wing.

Don't blame Chiellini because the team hasn't bought a competent defender since Calciopoli (Bonucci is a promise far from a reality yet).

Marchisio is another story. If some of you choose to call him overrated, sure, but he showed to be a great box-to-box midfielder when played properly and consistently. You can't expect Marchisio to be something he is not, and he is not a winger, unfortunately he has played just as many games as a winger than as a CM in recent times. I still have faith in the kid, but Delneri needs to play him consistently where he belongs, and today, he didn't do that.

Juve has quite a way to go to become a great team, many more players need to be bought and many more need to be sold. But I assure you that placing the blame on Chiellini and Marchisio for our poor showing will not solve our current situation.",Jose ,"Sep 16, 2010 ", 8:05 PM,

At the end of last season he had played in every single position except for goalie (ok, maybe I am exaggerating a little, but you get the point) and he got confused. South Africa didn't help with the confusion issue.

I am however hopeful he can improve his defensive role in the team. As the Sampdoria game showed, Felipe Melo is not enough to have control of the midfield and Aquilani is certainly not the answer defensively. If Marchisio can solidify his defensive game and go up only when the defense is well organized we will have control of the game.

-we save money by using the above mentioned to complete the roster instead of exercising the purchase option on people like Quagliarella(meh), Rinaudo(no), Traore(early and unfair to judge him but he doesn't look/sound much different than PDC as a player),

Ekdal-Had a pretty decent season at Siena and once he comes back from injury, I think he'll establish himself at Bologna. Maybe no starter potential but can definitely become a good team player IMO.
Marrone-I've started to like the kid a lot the last few months. Before his loan, in the few games he played during pre-season, he showed he's got balls, good stamina and is fairly disciplined tactically. Pretty impressive with the Azzurrini too, I think.
Pasquato-Looked inspired during pre-season and has 2goals in 2games in Serie B so far. What more can a man do?
Immobile-Definitely talented but he needs to get his shit together lol. A missed PK AND a red in about 25 minutes of play in his debut? Good God.
Rossi-See above. Still pretty young and has talent but he's constantly injured. If he can't stay healthy now, no chance of him ever having a decent career. Needs play time BAD.
Ariaudo-Should come back and be used in rotation next year for sure. Chiellini would be grateful too. Seriously though, he needs to gain weight; he's way too fucking skinny and fragile to try to establish himself as a Serie A CB.

Whenever I watched Siena (6-7 times) he was one of their better performers- very confident, a solid passer of the ball, good tackler as well.

Two things leaped out of my mind:

1. Do we really prefer Cassano to Giovinco?
While FantaTonio is currently the best fantasista in Italy and in the form of his life, he is 28 years old (not to mention his fragile temper) and will cost us around 20mil. I guess he's good only for another 2 years. Meanwhile, Gio is 23, considered one of the more promising young fantasistas (and there are not many around), and he's already ours! Whom do you choose?

2. Sissoko could be out for 10mil. He doesn't fit GDN's plan and cost us 12mill a few years back so I wouldn't hesitate one bit. A replacement is a must though, and one with a steady brain who is a great passer with good coordination skills will suffice. Anyone in mind?",dwicarta ,"Sep 14, 2010 ", 7:20 AM,

VotD: Krasic v. Sampdoria,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 13, 2010, 7:54pm PDT",,"1. I´m absolutely pro-Giovinco.

From December 2008: “Alessandro Del Piero has told Sebastian Giovinco that he’ll one day inherit the Juventus No 10 shirt – but he’ll have to be patient. The Under-21 international is a rising star in the Italian game and has inevitably been likened to Juventus skipper. And although Del Piero does believe that Giovinco has the X-factor, he’s going to have to wait for his chance. ""I won’t be here in five years,"" noted the 34-year-old. ""But Giovinco will be. The future is his, along with Claudio Marchisio and Paolo De Ceglie.""”

Even Gattuso said, one month ago or so, when he talked about the lack of talents in Italy, that Giovinco alongside Balotelli is the only expectation or something like that.

I also think it´s quite possible that everyone at Juventus feels like Giovinco is the natural heir to Del Piero, it´s only that Del Piero still plays. Actually, when do you guys think he´ll retire?

VotD: Krasic v. Sampdoria,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 13, 2010, 7:54pm PDT",,"very very sage words from Moggi –

Firstly about the transfer campaign :

Io invece sono tra quelli che vuole spingere la Juventus a far meglio, vuole spingere la Juventus a fare quello che il papà di Andrea faceva con noi: cioè portare i giocatori di qualità, che rappresentino l'immagine vera della Juventus, per tornare competitivi. E noi lo facevamo senza soldi. Qui si compra, si spendono 60 milioni per 11 giocatori, quando invece potevano essere spesi per due giocatori. Le squadre di calcio si fanno con due-tre giocatori per volta, non con 11. Con 11 si crea un casotto. Adesso vi do appuntamento all'anno prossimo: vediamo quanti di questi 11 se ne vanno via"".

Secondly on the Bonucci-Chiellini partnership:

“La difesa ha problemi quando il centrocampo non fa filtro. La Juventus ieri aveva un centrocampo con Melo, però con Melo non si fa un centrocampo, perchè lui è una parte difensiva del centrocampo stesso. Così non si costruisce niente e gli avversari arrivano sempre uno contro uno. La difesa della Juventus non è una difesa eccezionalmente veloce: i due centrali – Bonucci e Chiellini – non hanno capacità di recupero se sfugge un giocatore, quindi è normale che si incontrino delle difficoltà. Quindi la composizione è sbagliata in partenza. Avete visto il terzo gol fatto da Pozzi? Quello lì sta a dimostrare prima di tutto che non c'è concentrazione e, secondo, che non c'è l'esperienza necessaria. E poi mettere Chiellini accanto ad un giocatore della sua stazza non è una cosa ben fatta. Perchè quando Chiellini ha accanto un Cannavaro che recupera, è tutto diverso. Ma se Chiellini ha vicino un giocatore che non si integra con lui perchè ha la stessa velocità, diventa un problema. Se incontrassero Giaccherini o Miccoli…. con Miccoli i giocatori di stazza notevole hanno sempre trovato grosse difficoltà, perchè è uno rapido. Se incontrassero Giaccherini ora, Giaccherini li farebbe sedere per terra tutti quanti”.",Papai ,"Sep 14, 2010 ", 10:18 AM,

De Ceglie starts every match, making some mistakes in the first few games, but getting better every game. At the end ot the season he´s the Italy first choice left back.
Pepe, Aquilani, Quagliarella and Rinaudo fight like hell, to be hopefully bought by Juventus next year. Thus helping the team reaching a Champions League spot. However, only Aquilani will be bought for much cheaper than the fixed price, because he doesn´t want to go back to Liverpool, or better, wants to stay at Juve.
Chiellini and Bonucci work really well, because Bonucci is young (!!) and can improve a lot, to compliment Chiellini perfectly.
Meanwhile, Giovinco returns. He developed into a world-class striker, becoming capocannoniere in the progress.
To partner Giovinco up-front, we´ll buy Dzeko for 25 million, because of a fixed-buy-price-clause Marotta included in the Diego deal.
Krasic, of course, already owns the right wing, so we only need a left winger and a right back. (Which could be Netherlands-duo Van der Wiel and Elia)

Forza Juve and Forza Marotta. He did a good job and I suggest we all focus on that instead of thinking about what could've been.",Robee ,"Sep 14, 2010 ", 1:33 PM,
VotD: Krasic v. Sampdoria,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 13, 2010, 7:54pm PDT",,"I think Moggi doesn't realize what he is suggesting is impossible. We only had 30m to spend, how could we have bought 3 stars or even 2 star players for 30m?. How could we buy two or three of Dzeko, Pazzini, Schweinsteiger, Alvez, Coentrao, Suarez, for 30m?. If we buy only one of them could we have gone to CL next year?… doubtful.

Marotta bought 2 squads, admittedly, mediocre squads, with 30m. Our starting squad is not on par with Inter or Milan and even Roma, but it is certainly more on par with Genoa, Fiorentina, Sampdoria and the others we will be fighting for 4th place. The difference is depth, when the crunch of the season comes in February or March Genoa, Sampdoria, and Fiorentina will have injured players and their quality will drop considerably, for us, not so much, at least not on the midfield or forward department. Our reserve defense, except for Legro is dreadful, and hopefully some of that can be corrected in January. I think it will be in those months when Marotta's job will really come to light.

After that, with 4th place achieved we can start buying champions, 2 or 3 at a time while selling older successful players. Moggi said recently he would have kept Ballotelli and sold Milito, because Milito at 31 has only one or two more years, while right now we can get lots of money for him. I don't know if I would have kept Ballo, but selling Milito to bring in Lukaku, or a rising star or two would have been a great move. That is exactly what Juve needs to do and what we needed to do after Calciopoli. We sold our stars for peanuts, specially Ibrahimovic, we got little money and decreased our ability to become the top Italian team once again in one smooth shot.

I wish Marotta would have bought Bonnuci and half of Rannochia, that would have been a genius move but we had no money to do that. Also, I don't know if Presiozi would have allowed us to strengthen our defense to that degree knowing that Genoa and us will be fighting for 4th spot, that would have been a Secco like move.

Speaking of defenders, I agree that Rannochia would have been a better partner to Chiellini but he came from a grave injury and is still a gamble. Also, he was substituted after half by Gasperini in the last game. So either he said something to really upset Gasperini or his injury is still hunting him down, both of which would be a problem for us. Bonucci is not the ideal partner for Chiellini but it is certainly an improvement for our defense. Maybe at the end of the year we can sell him for a profit somewhere else and mount a chase for Rannochia, or at least for half of him.

Last year's issue was money, we didn't even get a second sponsor, and now that the mercatto is closed it is clear we had 30m to build two new squads. I think Marotta did a descent enough job with what he had, and honestly, I don't know if Moggi could or would have done better. If we make it to the CL next year, then we can see if Marotta has what it takes to sign a couple of stars that would improve our game significantly so we can fight for second place, and after that, we can see how to catch Inter.",Jose ,"Sep 14, 2010 ", 3:12 PM,

THIS Juve has just begun its climb back up the mountain.

Besides, THIS Juve is already a massive improvement on post-Calciopoli Juve, and while it is obvious that not only Moggi & Marotta have somewhat different market strategies, we mustn't forget Moggi's amazing ability at getting future star players for cheap was also due to the enormous influence he had in the football world (particularly in Italy).

Moggi was great for us, but also made some transfers that were way off and people tend to forget that. Like it or not, but bringing Moggi back would hurt us more than it would help us.

I have to disagree with people that were excited with Marchisio's performance. To me, the kid still needs to grow, and quite a bit more. Yesterday he scored a goal and was a lot better than the Bari game but he is still not the Marchisio we knew from the Ranieri years. If he gets back to that level then a salary increase should definitely be offered. He also needs to understand the the high salaries to Amauri and other non-performing players was the work of Secco, and that with the new management you really have to deliver to get an increase (hopefully).

I also read that Marotta has admitted that this Juve team has no champions but is a well constructed team that is aiming for 4th place. I don't know how that will sit with the squad, I know they are trying to keep expectations low and that is always good. I just hope the squad takes this as an encouragement to demonstrate that some of our players can become champions (Marchisio for instance). However, the fact that Marotta recognizes this team for what we all know it to be is encouraging. Last year Secco thought our Juve will win the scudetto and Blanc was preordering a jersey with 3 stars… we know what really happened after. Now, at least Marotta knows there is a long way to go to get us that third star, and that can only be a good thing.",Jose ,"Sep 13, 2010 ", 3:43 PM,

To me Chiellini is a great defender, probably among the best three in the world beside Pique and Vidic (of last year, I haven't seen Vidic play this year). But the truth is he hasn't won anything). A champion to me is someone who has won something of value (sorry Melo, the confederations cup doesn't count). A Scudetto or La Liga, or a Champions League, or at least someone that has carried the team on his shoulders to a final. Take Nedved, he was pivotal for us getting into the CL final against Milan. Or Del Piero who scored so many free kicks in the dying minutes to help us win games and got us championships. That is why I don't consider Chiellini a champion even though I think he is one of the top three defenders in the world.

To me, a player who has won something of value, someone whom without his contribution that title would not have been possible, that is a champion.

Melo is playing well generally, but making some major mistakes from time to time

17 Reasons to Celebrate,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 11, 2010, 1:45pm PDT",,"So in general:

Let's start with good things

- We have potential for sure

- Krasic and Pepe worked finally in second (nice touches, especially Krasic)

- We show a bit of our charachter (for a while)

- GK ( he is good, no doubt)

- PDC (till Marilungo came in he was our stable man on the back,later a bit tired.GOOD)

- Melo he has a will and desire to prove himself (finally, ecept 3-4 wrong passes,BAD)

THE BAD THINGS

1. Our defence more leaky than last season for now ( It can be improved for sure, they need games to gel i think, but..???)

2. Motta – guy was good in pre-season but if he keep playing like this soon GRYGERA will be starter.He was the main reason to conceed so many today and all totally outplayed from everyone on the right side,BAD MAROTA)

3. Concentration – we do the same again,again and again especially in defence. (Bonucci 3d goal,NO WAY)

4.ADP – you are great but we need young freshy legs and fast moves upfront(Visibly stop some good play for a moments because of his ages)

5. SUBS -i dont know what is wrong with this coaches these days but…KRASIC and PEPE? …come GDN you are a bit better than Raniery it seems (late a lot to change Mota and guess 2 more goals,especially second)",JIJI_PL ,"Sep 12, 2010 ", 1:08 PM,

Serie A worst sporting director of the Year: Silvio Berlusconi (NOT Galliani)
Serie A mercenary of the Decade: Zlatan Ibrahimovic

Note:
I have nothing against Milanista (in fact, I have no ill-feel towards Il Diavolo), but I agree with Mr. Arrigo Sacchi:

“Milan made some great additions, but Ibrahimovic is individualistic and he has trouble trying to play a team game.

”Robinho is the classic Brazilian with all the skill and movement, but again he finds it hard to play collectively.

Final Table:
1. Roma
2. Inter (They are more realistic, but I just can't stand them)
3. Juve
4. NOT Milan.",dwicarta ,"Sep 12, 2010 ", 3:29 PM,

Krasic did not disappoint. He looked completely lost for the first 35 mins. Pepe worked hard on offense and defense. He whipped in some decent crosses that were full of venom. Our midfield was impressive. Melo is starting to get my attention and looking more of his fiorentia self. He had two really stupid passes but made overall had a solid game. Marchisio took his first goal well – and celebrated like he had something to prove. Nice to see some fire out of that boy. The defense had some gaps and they were exploited.

- Absolutely loved the fact that the intro song when Juve team came out to warm up before the game was Thunderstruck by AC/DC!

- They also sung 'Milos Milos Krasic Krasic' in the second half, in exactly the same way like 'Pavel Pavel Nedved Nedved'.
- The fans were generally satisfied with the game and performance (to my surprise). I assumed they'd all be very angry to give away the lead twice, but may be after last season's disaster & the Bari game, everybody had low expectations.",rhaaj ,"Sep 12, 2010 ", 8:24 PM,

First off, look at the source of that article… goal.com!! I looked up the original article in Italian on Tuttosport.it, couldn't find it. Unless it was in the paper edition, I have doubts on the truthfulness of that quote. Also, it might have been mistranslated. So let's avoid turning this into another “burn Melo at the stake” rally.

Secondly, even if Gigi Del Neri's quote was indeed correct, I find the fact Melo jokes (i.e. stands out among the crowd) in the changing room revealing. This follows the same trend of some of his tweets: when Inter lost the European Super Cup he was all like “Hahaha Inter 2 goals down. Forza Juve!!”, and before our return leg vs. Sturm Graz again, addressing the Juve tifosi “Let's go guys! I want to see you all at the stadium this evening. Forza Juve” etc. etc.

Quite simply, I think the man is overcompensating. Considering his last season, he's got a lot to be forgiven for and he is determined to turn his performances around. For that Melo must be commended, and I for one have no complaints of his performance vs. Bari (in fact, he should never have been subbed off).

In the same light, I think Blanda_Amania and jorid22's psycho-analysis of Melo is excellent:

Remember this is a man who we signed while he was completely dominating the Fiorentina midfield, and did so for a short while for us too before our season went to shit.

some differences (and this was before i consulted wikipedia):

1) between Gianluca and Luca, i've thought of Zambrotta and Pesotto (can't decide which is which), Vialli slipped my mind, d'oh! (thanks, SUW)
2) totally tricked by Angelo, Di Livio slipped too (and just know about that room-sharing fact)
3) i thought Simone was Perotta. i already knew he was at Juve, checked the fact at his wikipedia page confirmed that he was at Juve in the proper timeframe. the only doubt is he was only played five times, thus perhaps doesn't deserve an “ADP's honorable mention” (if that's what it is, in that case the current Simone isn't particularly more deserving IMO, that's why i missed him in the first place)

well that was fun!

although if you, or anybody else, want we could stretch the game onto the question: who's the most prominent player that was NOT mentioned?

Correction on the first Gianluca: it must definitely be Vialli. It corresponds to the time-period (Ravanelli-Baggio-etc.) of the names mentioned after him.

I suppose Simone could be Perrotta, but notice he mentions him last? Must be a new arrival, hence Pepe. Plus Perrotta didn't really stay very long at Juve to make an impact.

Marcelo is most definitely Zalayeta. Salas didn't stay long enough.

I'm still stuck on Luca. I suppose it could be Pessotto or Zambrotta, but I'm not aware of either of them being called without the “Gian”…

Juventus once had an all star team (Zidane, Trez, Del Piero, Tacchinardi, Deschamp, Ferrara, Baggio) that made every average player that just joined the team had the motivation to achieve the star level as the rest. I remembered Camoranesi when he was first joined the team, he was only average winger with above average technique but then he evolved into one of the best winger in the league with Zidane, Nedved, Del Piero and the rest setting the limit.

Now all the new players do not have those players that can inspire them. It makes players like Krasic looks like a God. I think our transition has messed up due to the relegation to Serie B.

Fortunately I think Del Neri realizes this also, and he just needs some time to hammer the schemes and repitition into their thick heads!

Werder=We'll see how they'll do with no Kroos and most importantly Ozil. If your GK is Tim Wiese though…No better than us.
Lyon=Their lineup is great too. On a second thought, Lyon should be placed in the teams above us category. Cissokho, Bastos, Toulalan, Gourcuff, Kallstrom and Lisandro would all start in this Juve. Pjanic, Ederson and Grenier aren't bad either.

Music to my ears.

If he's got 1/2 of his father's ability, he should do a great job.

Legrottaglie: ""I would like to stay at Juve for life""
So much youth and a will to do well: The new Juventus 2010/11 is based on youngsters but without forgetting the experience of its veterans, players who have been wearing the black and white jersey for years and who have learnt to bear its weight. Amongst these is Nicola Legrottaglie.

The defender from Bari is one who knows Del Neri’s instructions by heart, having been one of the central players in the Chievo of miracles and his presences is fundamental. This is not only the case on the field but also in the dressing rooms. With one month to go for his 34th birthday, Nicola has still a great deal to give to the team: ""Physically I feel better then when I was 20 years old – he confessed during an exclusive interview on Sky-. I have an expiring contract but I would like to spend the rest of my career at Juventus. It is obvious that the team must believe that I can be an added value"".

Legrottaglie would like to remain in an environment he knows well and which is appreciated even more when away from Turin. ""When we move away you can see the differences in organization, reputation and support. This jersey is missed and this is why it is difficult to leave it. Football is like this. The seasons end and others open even in the history of your career. When you make a choice and you find yourself in another team, I think there should be no controversy but peace and serenity just like mature men. This should not give way to anything else. This year mates like Trezeguet and Camoranesi left us and I thank them and send my most affectionate regards to them. They are and always will be a part of my life"".

With the championship on a break due to the international matches and seeing the absence of Chiellini and Bonucci, Legrottaglie took up the role of tutor for new signing Leandro Rinaudo. ""A great team which fights until May must have three/four central defenders capable of being part of the staring line-up. I think that with Giorgio we had two great championships. Now the starter is Bonucci and I must respect the choices made but at the same time I will not give up because I believe in what I do and will fight to win back my place"".

Finally, a look at the season which has just begun and the role that Juventus might have: ""Inter and Milan are ahead of us. The rossoneri have given a sign by signing Ibrahimovic. Our minimum objective is to improve on last year and enter the Champions League zone besides doing well in the Europa League"".",agiamba ,"Sep 3, 2010 ", 5:00 PM,

I have no problems with having the backbone of the team made up of Italians, or the ItalJuve idea. However, if this idea is being pursued with a narrow-minded, nationalistic reasoning, we all have to be very careful. Juve has never been a club with a dominant right-wing fan profile (there are right-wing groups among the fans, but they do not DEFINE Juve, unlike, say, Lazio); it has always been a global team, and there's a reason for that. You can be global, you can be cosmopolitan while still retaining your Italian identity (something the Interastri never understood).

If Delneri really wanted Diego and Marotta went against his clear judgment, that's also a bad sign for things to come. The Alex Ferguson model of management (as much as I dislike the man) might be of some use to Juve, especially now, since a long-term future plan is being put into place.

If Delneri and his successors are going to be treated like the secretary at the club (not that I support disrespect towards secretaries, but you get my point) how much personal investment in the team will they have, and how quickly will they become frustrated?

Here's a thought: did Marotta sell Diego because he wanted to decrease the Brazilian contingent to one? I mean let's face it: Amauri is now an Azzurro so he gets to hang out with the cool kids (Buffon, Del Piero, etc.). All that is left is Melo!

So perhaps Marotta, the evil genius, thought:
Diego + Melo + Amauri = Samba.
Samba = poor focus in training.
Poor focus = garbage performance.

So, you eliminate Diego and you turn Amauri into an Italian. No more samba. And Melo can finally play decent. Doesn't this make perfect sense???

I agree with all your individual grades except for 3.

Pepe: D; He's average at best, and even then he's rarely at his best. Like a midfield version of Molinaro, the only thing he can do consistently well is run. It just goes to show the dearth of wide options in Italy when Simone Pepe starts for both Juve AND the Italian national team.

Martinez: F; Maybe I'm being biased here, but I just think he's shite. Definitely not worth anything near what we paid for him (I would say he worth half that at most). Having seen him play here and there for Catania the past couple years I can safely tell you there is absolutely nothing special about him. Sure he's scored some goals, but most of them have been scrappy “bundled the ball over the line goals” or tap ins. He's definitely no winger and would be better as some kind of forward. Add to that the fact that he's been training since the start of pre-season training and he's STILL not 100% fit, and gets promptly injured first game…I'm willing to bet that (unless Ibra, Robinho or maybe Hernanes massively bomb) he'll be Bidone d'Oro come December.

Marotta: C; I understand some points (especially the need to balance the books and the lack of UCL football), but I still think better could have been done. For one, we should have had something close to our final squad a lot sooner, and having organized specific targets and alternatives we may not have had to scrape the barrel for, for example, Rinaudo (I remember pointing out earlier that Cesena signed Swiss international Steve von Bergen on a free, why couldn't we have done that? Or Bocchetti before Rubin Kazan got in there?). The late moves will hurt us in the short term, as the team needs to gel. And after losing our first game, with Samp, Udinese, Palermo and Cagliari one after the other, there could be more points lost. Sigh…And then there's the Diego debacle. So yeah, I think he should get a C at best.",Nnahoj ,"Sep 2, 2010 ", 10:25 PM,

That Wolfsbur mercatto cannot be compared with ours. They bought 4 players (according to your list), we bought 11. We needed to pretty much change half of the team. 4 players wouldn't have made a difference.

Now the conservatism/mediocrity arguments:

- Age: we are building a young squad (the youngest in serie A in fact).
- The world changing tactics to offensive wingers: that's exactly the kind of wigers we will have in our 4-4-2, offensive ones.
- I assume you meant here a Giovinco comment: I agree it could be seen as conservative to send him on loan, but I don't think that's a bad thing. He stays and we have problems (plus lots of pressure), he won't play that much since we have a clearly objective which is 4th place. He goes to Parma: he gets lots of playing time and has more chances to develop than at juve. Why risk Seba's development when we don't need him for our current objectives?
- Average italian: some of the palyers we hired are average (pepe, rinaudo), agreed, but their averagness reflect on their cost, and we needed to sign lots of players to accomplish our objectives (as Marotta said), hence we needed some cheap players or players willing to come on loan (since we don't have money to sign permanently 11 players at once).

I just got back from my vacation in Mexico a few weeks ago. The place where I stayed at had various bars. One of them was a sports bar which predominantly showed soccer games. Anything from the Mexican League, to the Community Shield, E.L, summer friendlies etc etc etc. The walls of the bar were decorated with dozens of jerseys, scarves, flags and other stuff from teams from all over the world. Anything from Real, Barca, Bayern, Liverpool, ManU, Borussia Dortmund, Ajax, Chivas, Morelia, America, Sao Paolo, Boca etc.

You're gonna say, “So there was no Serie A/Italy stuff there at all?” Wrong.

Nothing from Inter, nothing from Milan, just a big Juve flag and a NT Luca Toni jersey up on the wall.

Also, while playing beach soccer every noon, I met an Abruzzese (born there) living in Vancouver who was also a huge Juve fan. What's funny is that he confessed having been an Inter fan when he was a kid but (and I quote) “Got sick of Inter and everything they stood for very soon”.

But he did and unlike the others started almost EVERY game. Which means that marotta didnot believe in the words of his manager (or his wishes) and THAT is a serious issue. All marotta had to do was to bring in 1 winger, 1 striker and 3 defenders. We had enough depth in midfield with the likes of de ceglie, giovinco and camo (for one more season). That's 5 players and if you want another midfielder that would make it 6. That's as simple as it gets. We weren't aiming for honours. We were looking to build a team season by season. So we get quality in this season finish 4th or 3rd and then build on that the next season. With players like martinez, pepe, lanzafame, rinaudo, traore, (not to mention an ineffective defensive player in motta)…we have taken a step backwards. Ranieri achieved third place with the likes of tiago, poulsen, sissoko, molinaro, grygera and last seasons squad was a def improvement in quality. All they had to do is work with a squad that knew each other well and was willing to play for the shirt.

Diego Hits Out at Marotta,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 2, 2010, 1:50pm PDT",,"1 winger, 1 striker and 3 defenders eh?

Camo is injured most of the time so he won't be starting, and as I mentioned in a previous post, we needed a substitute who could actually play and not be injured (what if the starter needs to rest or gets injured while camo is still injured?). We could have kept camo, but we needed to buy 2 right wingers nonetheless.

Then you have Gio and PDC on the left. As I mentioned above, keeping Gio was a risk that we didn't need to take. And PDC is not a great winger either (he's average I'd say). He can do the job against a slow and old zambrotta, but we played him as a winger a couple of times last season and that wasn't encouraging (ok, everybody sucked last season, but he could easily play badly as winger, as he is doing right now as a fullback). So we need to buy another winger, cuz when you base your game on the wings (4-4-2), you can't have only 4 of them while one of them is very injury prone.

3 defenders: I'd say we needed 4, two starting fullbacks and a starter CB plus its substitute.

What about a goalkeeper? Buffon isn't magically coming back from his injury anytime soon, and having only Manninger for so long (who already got injured once) would not have been a wise call.

1 striker… agreed :p… specially since we were losing Trez.

There you go, that's 9 players (with your midfielder, taht we needed cuz marchisio, melo and sissoko are not enough). Now you get a couple of loans really cheap to have some depth, just in case, and you have Marotta's transfer campaign.",pablouv ,"Sep 2, 2010 ", 11:57 PM,

Diego Hits Out at Marotta,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 2, 2010, 1:50pm PDT",,"There seems to be a lot of people here who are unhappy with Marotta's work in the transfer market. I just don't understand it. Marotta did everything that was asked of him. He rejuvenated the team, lowered the average age, lowered the wage bill, balanced the books, and improved the team compared to last year. This team is fighting for 4th place and they have what they need to do that.

As for the sale of Diego, he problem is that no other big teams put in bids for him. There was no bidding war and that helped Wolfsburg get a good deal. I think Diego should have been kept, but I guess Marotta just believed he was more valuable in the bank than on the field. If selling him helps Juve keep their finances stable and healthy into the future, then it will help Juve make more reinforcements next summer.

We might have been able to get a higher price for him next summer, but would the price have risen enough to have paid his wages for this season? Juve are going to have an extra 20 million to spend next summer (because we're not paying Diego's wages this season too). And considering we're only fighting for 4th this season, saving that money isn't such a bad idea. Del Neri is the coach, but Marotta has to look at everything long term. He has to do what's best for the team long term.

And when I said Juve are going to have an extra 20 million to spend next summer for selling Diego, that was being conservative. Wolfsburg paid 15.5 million to sign Diego, but could pay an extra 2 million if they fulfill certain sporting achievements. So the price for Diego could go up to 17.5 million. Then keep in mind that because we sold Diego before he fulfilled certain sporting achievements, we save the 2.5 million we would have owed Werder Bremen. So that only really creates a negative economic balance of 4.5 million.

Then keep in mind that Juve are saving the money from paying his wages, like I mentioned earlier. And with that money they brought in Quagliarella (who they would have needed anyway to help cover for the loss of Trez).

What if Trez and Giovinco were the ones who requested to leave? I wouldn't blame Giovinco for wanting to leave after 2 seasons on the bench. I expected it actually. And Marotta was very accommodating for both Trez and Giovinco and made sure they both went to clubs they wanted to go to. Gio preferred Parma to Bari (but we know he's still a part of the clubs future plans or else they would have sold him outright), and Trez wanted to move to his wife's hometown and end his career there.

It was Trez's agent who suggested Hercules as a location for him. And Juve was extremely accommodating so that Trez would be able to play for Hercules.

Lets wait until we see how all the pieces come together this season before we judge. That's what I think. A lot of people thought we'd be challenging for the scudetto after last seasons transfers, but things clearly didn't work out that way. Now people are less optimistic, but I think they'll do better than last year. The team needed a rejuvenation and needed to bring in new players.

Diego would have helped a lot this season, but I still think we'll finish forth even without him.

We replaced: Storari for Chimenti, Motta for Z3BINA, Bonucci for Cannavaro, Rinaudo for depth, Traore for Molinaro/Grosso, Krasic for Camoranesi(injury prone), Aquilani for Tiago/Poulsen, Lanzafame(home grown) for Giovinco, Quaglierella for Trezeguet(wanted to leave) and Martinez for Diego. It seems like except for Diego we have gained in quality. Trez & Camo are legends, but lets face it they are past their best and only stayed on because of their high salaries which made it difficult to blood youngsters or to get new players. I see Milan players taking pay cuts but none of our older stars were willing to do that or to except a sub role. I think this is selfish.Camo spent most of last year injured or serving suspension but took his full salary. Onyewu of Milan was injured and offered to play for free! Tiago, Z3BINA & Grosso are all pricks and never loved the jersey. Secco over paid on their salaries and gave them long contracts. Marotta can't be blamed for this. Over all I think he did a good job, we need hard work some luck and hopefully 1 striker in Jan and we can get 4th.",Wonder Maker ,"Sep 3, 2010 ", 4:32 AM,

There's not a lot of fantasy, but right now the focus is on grinding out results.

Also, as much as I love Camo, I could tell when I watched him play that he was playing without enthusiasm. Compare that to Krasic who is psyched to be at Juve right now. Trezeguet was the one who wanted the move to Hercules as I understand it. His agent was the one who suggested it as a destination. Juve weren't actively looking for offers for him. Giovinco needed to be loaned out to get experience. If he put in a few bad performances this year then the coach would be forced to bench him.

Moggi this, moggi that.. I cant believe people on this offside would like to see him back. he is an embarassment and even looks like a criminal. he should never be allowed to ever come withink 500KM of this team. if u actually think moratti was allowed to do this, your living in a fantasy world.. the league hasnt been the same since and will probably take another 10 years for juve and serie a to be where it was.. its sad, it really is sad and all that we are seeing now is a direct offshoot of what happened in 2006.",juve1 ,"Sep 4, 2010 ", 11:20 AM,

anyway, gave the same scores with you on the polls except 3/4 players that i gave a grade below. and it’s kinda hard judging buys without thinking about the sales, esp. in the same department. for example, i’d readily give Aquilani an A if not for the fact that his arrival, combined with Poulsen’s – and Ekdal’s – departure, has made our CM dept. defensively poorer. we only have Momo as a pure DM who’s [supposed to be] able to shield the back four, while the rest are more of a box-to-box type",hant00 ,"Sep 1, 2010 ", 11:37 AM,
An Early Look at the Mercato Signings,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 1, 2010, 9:52am PDT",,"Defense
Incoming: Storari (GK), Bonucci (CB), Rinaudo (CB), Motta (RB), Traore (LB).
Outgoing: Canna (CB), Caceres (RB), Zebina (RB), Molinaro (LB).
Analysis: Beppe did good and massively shore-up the defense. Storari is a bit pricey but Bonucci and Motta are major upgrades on the starting defense. A bit disappointment on the LB and backups, though. And Grosso stays. Not perfect but great job!
Grade: A-.

Midfield
Incoming: Krasic (W), Martinez (W), Pepe (W), Lanza (W), Aquilani (AM).
Outgoing: Poulsen (DM), Tiago (CM), Camo (W), Diego (AM), Gio (AM).
Analysis: Major change. Out goes the AMs and in comes the wingers. Krasic and Martinez should be good; Aqua, if healthy, can prove to be a steal. Pepe is not a juve material, though. Too bad couldn't sell Tiago permanently and no buyer for Salihamidzic. Moreover, we need a heady def midfield who can pass consistently. Melo and Sissoko are not that player. The biggest question remains: can the wingers replace the trequaristas as the playmakers?
Grade: C-.

Attack
Incoming: Quags.
Outgoing: Trez.
Analysis: An inconsistent (albeit sometimes spectacular) striker for a legend. Failed to have Borriello on loan. With Amauri and Iaquinta out for at least one month, only ADP and Quags are available for GDN. Yikes!
Grade: F

Spending
Expenditure: 56mil.
Revenue: 33mil.
Total: 23mil.
Analysis: Lost 10mil from the diego sales. Paid too much on Martinez. Also paid too much on Pepe and Quag's loans. On the other hand, we essentially only purchased Storari, Bonucci, Martinez and Krasic. All solid buys. Of the loans, Motta and Aqua (if proven healthy) can have major impacts.

I rated him in a similar fashion to the ratings players receive for games. If he would have kept Diego and told Hoeness to f*** off, he would have deserved a 7,5 IMO.

There was the brilliant such as:
-the Aquilani move,
-the Storari move. 4,5 but it's being paid in 3 rates and Storari is a GK so no big deal if he's 33,
-dictating the negotiations with CSKA,
-upgrading the RB position while paying simply 0,5mil,
-bringing back Lanza for pretty much no money,
-finally purchasing a good/promising CB,
-the Poulsen move,
-JZ's contract getting rescinded

and there was also the downright stupid like

-wasting time negotiating with Hoeness for Dzeko for as long as he did, while the team had more pressing concerns,
-dragging the Krasic negotiation for over 2 months when (according to the media at least), the deal had been concluded weeks before (verbally with CSKA at least)
-the panic-induced, out-of-the-blue, 12mil donation to Catania so early in the mercato,
-getting shafted by Genoa for the Bonucci and Criscito deals (acquiescing Preziosi and Capozucca's policy of 'either Bonucci or Criscito, not both')
-getting rid of Trez pointlessly, just to get rid of him while we still have to pay 3mil/year to him and no replacement was brought in. He could have been crucial for us for this upcoming month,
-selling Diego for 15,5 with a week to go, just days after having confirmed him and to the exact same douchebag who had been playing with us for weeks, while downgrading to FQ. Also Marotta's biggest mistake.

Ultimately, I'm of the opinion that Beppe did a lot, put together a team capable of what's being asked of them (3rd place finish) and I believe that as long as the team achieves this objective, next summer we are going to witness Marotta's ability at its best.",jorid22 ,"Sep 1, 2010 ", 6:42 PM,

An Early Look at the Mercato Signings,The Offside Juventus,"Sep 1, 2010, 9:52am PDT",,"I think Marotta has done well in terms of preparing a team, with some depth at most positions, to compete for a CL place.

Most of these deals, especially Aquilani/Quags/Traore/Motta/Pepe are deals where these are “good” players, and unless they perform TREMENDOUSLY over and above what is expected of them, we are not going to sign.

of these loans, I would want Aquilani and Motta, as I think they have promise…Quags..dont really car about because he's just that, Quags!

Pepe…hard worker, but kinda reminds me of Molinaro? has heart, but has no technical abilities, or the “genius” required of non-technical players!

so if you take out Quags (10.5M) Pepe (7.5M) and Traore, dont care to know what he would cost, as I think he is just “cover” for a “cover” player anyway.

so that saves us from 18M with only the 16M and 5M commited for Aquilani and Motta….

so with 21M or so gone out of next years transfer kitty…considering we “spent” close to 55M this year, WITHOUT CL money albeit!…I think that next year, with CL qualification and new stadium….Marotta will go for a BIG name, and I can bet that Dzeko is coming in, as that was a “down-payment” what we did with selling Diego to Wolfsburg..to ensure CL qualification for Wolfsburg this year, hence losing Dzeko and having CL money would be good for them, and we would get our guy for next year….

i think we have a VERY solid midfield with Marchisio/Melo/Sissoko(if he learns HOW to pass)/Aquilani…solid only if they hit form, and reach potential.

wingers…krasic and lanzafeme/giovinco next season, IF he wants to come back…and we get Dzeko and Pazzini/Cassano/Rossi…I think we would be a bad ass team!

the only thing left would be a GOOOOOOOOD LB!

Giovinco had to go on loan, that was the best thing for us and for him. Imagine if he came in a sucked for two games in a row, he would have been benched for another year.

Is he listening ENOUGH to what GDN thinks, then again, is GDN voicing his opinion loudly enough?
I thought about the Diego sale, and I realized that now we have no seconda punta WITH defensive capabilities… I'm not saying that Diego is a Chiellini, but due to his experience in attacking MIDFIELD rather than SS, he will naturally have more defensive capabilities than eg Quag (he might help a little bit defensively), ADP (he prob will be most likely to help out defensively), Iaquinta, and (sure as hell) Amauri… This is also apparent from how frequently he drops deep into midfield during attack and (a lil less here but still good enough) defending… My point is that, after following Zonalmarking for the last 8-9 months or so, I realized that with our 4-4-2 we MUST have one of our strikers help out defensively to harass (especially vs. a 4-3-3) one/all of the CM of the opponent, if not we get outplayed in Center of Mid… With seemingly/probably none of our strikers willing to do that, we may encounter serious problems when playing against AC, Inter, Man Shitty and more teams that may many players in CM…
Hence, did Beppe listen enough to GDN when he was told GDN's (tactical) desires for Diego? That's the only thing that I may doubt with Beppe, as management-coach relationship/communication is crucial for a team (see Liverpool under Benitez with the 2 Americans and Perez's way of not listening to RM coaches concerning transfers) for the rest Beppe is just fine=) Sorry for the long post btw^^",Chukwueku Akinyemi ,"Sep 1, 2010 ", 7:59 PM,

I think you rate some transfers far too well. I expected a lot more. Tottenham spent €8m to sign Van Der Vaart just before the window closed. That's half of the value we got from Diego. Even though VDV has been a failure at Real he could have been a good option for Delneri's 4-4-2. We also badly needed another striker when we let Trezeguet go but that didn't happen. I like Boriello but he wasn't ideal for a 4-4-2. He would have been useful had we stuck with last years formation but I'm happy he didn't arrive this year. Pazzini was vital but it didn't happen. Marotta should have made sure the holes left from Diego's and Trezeguet's departures would have been filled before the window closed but he didn't. To me that is somewhat of a failure. I do however believe that Marotta did relatively well considering the mess the previous management had left for him.

Looking at the other teams in the league; I think we have a somewhat consistent squad that can last through the season but not one that will get us to the Champions League.

i share your point 100% about van der vaart,…

martinez looked first a bit expensive, but seeying vdvaart leaving for 11m(it was 11 not 8 but still cheap) both diego and ozil, robinho leaving for 15 or less,…makes suddenly the martinez move the most retarded signing of the entire transfer campaign,… did we even try? did we even knock on reals door to inform?? no… besides van der vaart there where other players is saw going for pretty good deals and would have been fram any perspective a better reinforcement than some we did.

the fact we did not even try to lure vd vaart class, try attemt on rossi( villareal are in desperate need of finacial injection) but we did try borriello, did try for 33 old di natale, did try for quags,…
and then above all sell diego, and crush giovinco's trust , probably forgood,…

well to me it says we've entered an new era, with new standards and they are definetly LOWER than the standards suited for a club like juve,….

luring a vandervaart would have been from any angle a better reinforcemetn than martinez, letting diego and giovinco stay would have been an better reinforcement than aquiring pepe and quags. can it be any more clear then krystal?",bekhele ,"Sep 2, 2010 ", 12:23 AM,

benzema: in spanish media 2 things were clear :1 mourinho wanted an extra 3rd striker 2 he was denied by the president or in other words benzema will be only available after real buys other strikers

giovinco: why people think he will come back? we showed no trust in 2 years, guess what signal is it then to loan him once again, if he remains fit he will play of course great and attract many suitors; why would he go back to a mediocre juve if true great teams are attracted to him?

as AL posted here before me out of diego's comment

""Marotta decided to sell me because he wants just Italians""

well that scares the shit out of me,…truly, ??? true juve have great tradition to be nr 1 supplier of the national team,
but much more "" truer"" is every great squad has always been a mixture between locals and foreigners.

i fail to share optimism with some of you think “yeah its a good plan for next year then the big names will come”,…

first of all decreasing quality in your squad is a retarded vision in my opinion from any perspective.
I read comments which APPLAUDE the fact we never purchaised any great champions? seriously?

let me remind our targets for offense were from start of an unrealistically dzeko and then 33 old di natale, static boriello and quags,….
if we wanted cheap why we didnt puch for EXAMPLE for mladen PETRIC, according german media he was available for around 6-7m(!) and clearly the Croatian international is better and faster than amauri and iaquinta together

And I haven't seen any comments (besides Melo's) about how much we will miss Diego.

I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much. But attitude problem fits better in my mind than quality problem, Diego is certainly a quality player.",pablouv ,"Sep 2, 2010 ", 11:15 AM,

(a) An ok step in the rejuvenating direction with the acquisitions of Bonucci, Lanzafame (returned form loan), Motta, Krasic, Aquilani & Traorè… But I don't see how Quagliarella, Pepe, Martinez fit in the idea of “rich in experience at the highest level”. I do like Storari as our back-up keeper.

(b) I'm not sure what “renewing the atmosphere” means… In the dressing room? In the stadium? In the board room?

PotD: The Grinta is Back,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 30, 2010, 6:48pm PDT",,"I'm going to have a go at the player ratings..
Storari – 7 – pulled out some great saves, was not to be blamed for Ibra's goal. Solid performance from the veteran.
Motta – 6 – good in some areas, but sloppy in others. looking better than he was at the start oif the season, has learnt to go forward less.
Bonucci – 7 – great performance by the italian international, looked shaky in some instances but eventually handled pato pretty well. had not many problems with legro by his side.
Legrottaglie – 6.5 – good solid performance by legro. couldn't have asked better of him, done chiellini proud in his position.
Paolo De Ceglie – 7 – this kid keeps getting better, game by game he continues to impress me. made many good tackles and interceptions during the match. taken off due to injury.
Jorge Martinez – 6.5 – no doubt that he surprised everybody. great performance, made some nice tackles and ran pretty hard until his substitution also because of injury.
Felipe Melo – 7.5 – arguably the man of the match for juve. del neri has turned him into a warrior. he fought for every ball, if he lost it, he'd win it back. made good passes and commanded the midfield. also has a very funny dance to celebrate each goal.
Alberto Aquilani – 6.5 – strong performance from the so called 'liverpool flop' im sure everybody is eating their words now. he was a key man in midfield, passing was good, was back when he needed to be. not so much of a flop now is he?
Claudio Marchisio – 6.5 – much of the same to be said about 'il principino' good solid performance in his out of favour position. really symbolises the never say die attitude of juventus.
Fabio Quagliarella – 7 – good old quags showed us once again that he is worthy of an italian national team spot. great performance, made nice runs, good passing and used great vision to pick out momo and a great headed goal midway into the 1st half.
Alessandro Del Piero – 7 – the legend himself put in a great show to break boniperti's goal scoring record of 178 goals. he continues to inspire all juventini world wide and showed why he is a legend, GRANDE CAPITANO!!!!
SUBSTITUTIONS:
Mohamed Sissoko – 6 – the malian wall put in an average performance. didn't do much wrong, set up del piero in very weird fashion with his trademark 'fall over like an idiot' but then get up and pass it. He still got the assist, none-the less.
Simone Pepe – 6 – the out of favour winger was put into the backline and showed us that he is capable of being in the backline. ran like hell as usual, average performance.
Amauri – N/A – not much to say, only touched the ball once when he came on, good to see his injury wasn't as serious as once thought.
GIGI DEL NERI – 9 – made great work of this juventus squad. everybody thought -'no krasic, no juve' but they were heavily mistaken. well done gigi.

I know there are plenty of you who are not sold on us signing Quagliarella but I have a feeling he'll step up. He seems to be a team player and adds another dimension to our attack. Lets look strictly at the numbers. Also, I'd sell Amauri and Keep quags in a heartbeat. Just sayin. In retrospect, Marotta had a fantastic summer mercato. Krasic alone can justify the sale of Diego. We may even get Dzeko out of it yet.
BRAVO Marotta!

I was so sad yesterday to hear that PDC had a fracture and wouldn't be returning for 3 months. HE has grown so much in the last 6 games. I'm a bit gutted about that. It will take a while for him to return to form.. GDN has suggested that PEPE may play as a fullback for a temporary solution to the problem. I have a feeling that we will be getting a leftback in January. I don't think Grosso will play and rightfully so.

I don't have a problem with Marchisio playing on the left since Aquilani is playing so well. Marchisio is a low flyer player who is versatile enough to play any position…Even Lippi tried,though unsuccessfully, to play him as a trequartista. His impact on a game is huge but can go unnoticed. I think he will be good with playing on the left, especially if we are playing against teams with strong fullbacks. Our problem will be getting more width on the left, but I almost feel that our leftback can overlap with Marchisio and attack too. With Pepe as a quick fix as Lback and Marchisio solidifying the back left side, we may have been gifted a new partnership???

Can't believe I'm saying this but Grygera>Motta at the moment and should be played before him once he's fit.

The only Italian team to have never been relegated. That is why that punishment was suggested, I am sure. Now that Juve are a threat again, it only makes sense that someone else would step up to try to keep them down.

But the great thing about Juve is that they are champions. You can't relegate the class and dignity out of a team. You can't ban it, either. If Berlusconi and his cronies think that by banning Krasic, they've set Milan up to win, they may be sorely mistaken tomorrow. On any given day, any number of Juve players can step up to the occasion. Krasic is only one of many champions.

I am always sad for the politics of football, and hope that tomorrow's game is truly decided on the pitch. As much as I would love for Milan to win (politics aside,) I look forward to a great game. In bocca al lupo!",MrsShankly ,"Oct 29, 2010 ", 4:20 PM,

As much as I like watching him play, he has a track record as a team cancer. Do we really want to bring someone like that into Juve now, considering we are in a rebuilding-mode this year….

This is also the same Cassano who 2 years ago in his autobiography said regarding his lifestyle of excess: ""I spent the first 17 years of my life dirt-poor.

My qualm is that Cassano is the antithesis of what Juve stands for. He's not hard-working, he cares only when he feels like it, and most importantly he will have absolutely no loyalty to the Juve shirt. I want players who put the club above personal glory and ego, and Cassano has never done this in any of his previous stints.

We have done an incredible job so far of reJUVEnating this squad (see what I did there), and yes the talent is still lacking, but the mindset and spirit is refreshing. Sure it sounds all flowery and cliched, but I think we've seen what happens when we bring in players like Krasic who WANT to play for Juve and understand what it means to represent the club.

Storari: Great saves and calming influence at defense.
Motta: Improved but the weakest link in the team. Constantly passed by the opponents.
Bonucci: Getting better and better every game.
Legro: thrown in at the last minute but didn't disappoint. A champion.
PDC: Superb cross for the opening goal, and great overall display before getting hurt. Link up with Martinez on the left wing surprisingly well.

Marchisio: Super plumber. Great covering the wing and link up well with others to attack.
Melo: Shield the back four nicely and his passes were greatly improved.
Aquilani: Our regista. 'nuff said.
Martinez: Getting better by the game. Punked bonera often times. Shame he's injured again.

ADP: Rarely lost the ball and you can always count on him to score. He did. 179 baby!!!
Quags: Play well all game and a great header to score. Amauri take note please.

Subs:
Pepe: Finally Zambrotta'd. Shaky but shown a lot of grinta.
Sissoko: Fucked up a one on one but superbly stayed on his feet and passed to ADP. Got an assist for his trouble. Not bad momo.
Amauri: Great job holding the ball and wasted some minutes to close the game.

Guest Post: Milan Juventus - Against The Hypocrites,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 29, 2010, 8:03am PDT",,"Just finished watching the game, with a Milanista by my side (my brother). The stakes were high for me too, if we lost he gets to bug me for another 4 or 5 months until we meet again. Anyway, thoughts on this great game

- Delneri taught our boys how to defend. I started watching the game after 10 minutes so I didn't know the line-up. We were defending so well that I didn't even notice Chiellini was missing. I am sure if he would have been playing Ibra would not have scored. Nonetheless, an attack of Robinho, Ibra, Pato and Inzaghi scoring only one goal against a defense that was made-up in the last five minutes of the match and revamped during the match is a great outcome.

Side note to Secco. Do you see what inveseting in defense does to the team????. I also want to give kudos to Marotta for recognizing this and getting us a coach with a great defensive record. Delneri is no Capello, or Mourinho but he is working well for us

Midfield was solid as well. Without Krasic we played an amazing game. This game would really help us realize that we don't need La Furia Serba to win every game and that can only be a good thing. Don't get me wrong, having Krasic would have helped matters but have in mind that the winning goal came from a Sissoko, Marchisio, Melo, Aquilani midfield.

- Forwards. Del Piero and Quagliarella did great. When Del Piero scored the goal I told my brother. Our defense last year was like yours in the Del Piero goal. No one covered Del Piero and our capitano put it in. Quags run for all he is worth, did a great job, should we buy him?? No, unless he plays like today for 90% of the remaining matches. Amauri even did a descent job of holding the ball

- Other thoughts: Marchisio with the captain armband… wow, I think I am going to dream about that tonight. Melo was a beast, although his celebration when he stopped that shot burned my retinas. Aquilani is such an elegant player. Legro and Bonucci had a great understanding. Having an experienced player organize the defense really helps, Chiello should learn that. PDC, is our fullback for the remaining of the season, if we buy someone it needs to be a substitute for him.

Lastly, I am going to borrow the words of Adam Digby in a previous post. Juve doesn't buy champions we make champions. Watching Juve today was like watching Lippi's Juve, never give-up, never back down, grinta pouring out of their ears. All of our players were disgusted at the whole prospect of loosing a match. Until the next game all 14 players that took part in this match played like champions, our coach, coached like a champion and us the fans could not have been more proud of wearing the black and white.",Jose ,"Oct 30, 2010 ", 10:02 PM,
Guest Post: Milan Juventus - Against The Hypocrites,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 29, 2010, 8:03am PDT",,"My hat off to GDN, last year Melo was rubish, this year he's like a new signing.

Guest Post: Milan Juventus - Against The Hypocrites,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 29, 2010, 8:03am PDT",,"My thoughts on the match:

As I said before, a win against all odds and could very well be a season defining game for us.

On the defense:
Storari, solid as ever, dont know why Milan sold him to us and kept Abbiati?

Bonucci and Leggro worked as a great combo and complemented each other very well.

Motta, still a little clumsy, but hes still showing signs of improvement.

De Ceglie, I am really starting to love you. I love what Del Neri has done with him, that cross was just delicious and defensivley was solid yet again. Playing very consistently atm, hope he isin't injured for too long.

Pepe, looked okay, wasn't goalside of Ibra when we conceded. A mistake that is acceptable from a rookie. I would really rather persist with him than recall Grosso, Salihams back.

On the Midfield:

Melo and Aquilani, these two seem to be te best pair of CM's in the league. There possible can't be anymore Melo haters amongst Juve fans. All must be forgotten from last season. When on form this guy is one of the WORLDS BEST DMC's, and hes creativity from deep is great to watch. And Aquilani is just showing Italy why he is a gun, ove how composed he is on the ball, WE HAVE TO BUY HIM BACK.

Marchisio, as i said before if worst comes to worst we can chuck him in as a centre back. He is just such a complete player and a great asset to have in the team. Another solid performance. Loved it when he got the captains armband.

Martinez, looked good, but a little slow and had a pretty heavy touch (FM 11 got that right). Dissapointing he got injured hope its not serious.

Sissokko, bahahaha, bahahahha, bahahhaha, that is all

On the Forwards:

Quags, full of running, great header and great ball to Sissokko. Usually the man who scores the most useless of goals, finally hit an important one!

Del Piero, do i have to say anything? I LOVE YOU!

Amauri, meh…

Defending Krasic- A History of Video Evidence in Disciplinary Measures,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 27, 2010, 2:39pm PDT",,"As Jorid posted in the last blog-

“Look, I don't know if I should call the decision made about Krasic through TV-proof and succeeding comments an idiocy or a load of bullshit (his words of choice were 'cazzata' and 'puttannata' lol). Since when is a player expected to come out and admit he actually dove? This might happen in the future generations, maybe in 2148! Now if the proper technology would have been present on the pitch, a real time decision could have been made, instead, they (the league) prefer to pay close attention to whether the managers are moving out of their designated areas on the sidelines! The 4th referee could prove useful if he had a monitor of sorts which he could use to better inform the head ref. If this would have been available in Krasic's case, he would have most likely gotten a yellow card for his gesture and still been present at San Siro against Milan.”

-He didn't use a shred of tact or professionalism and pretty much allowed the interviewer to get him to say what he wanted.

-He sounds bitter about Del Piero and Juventus in general but at the same time he 'throws the stone and hides his hand' as they say in Italy while contradicting himself. He hints at him and Del Piero not being on great terms, yet doesn't really reveal much and simply throws a “Maybe he doesn't like me?” around. Funny enough, someone posted this interview of Del Piero from 2008 over at VS:

http://www.lastampa.it/sport/cmsSezioni/quijuve/200812articoli/18206girata.asp

Its title is “Del Piero: 'Giovinco will take my place within 5 years.” and this part sticks out:

Journalist: “Was Giovinco being truthful when he mentioned he was learning everything from you or was he just joking?”

ADP: “He would have no reason to lie. Within 5 years I won't be around anymore and he will have taken my place. The future is his just as it is Marchisio's and De Ceglie's.”

Regardless of his relationship with Del Piero, admitting you don't even give a damn about the club that made you who you are and still owns you in full is idiotic.

I've always been of those who would have liked him to have gotten more chances the last few years after all.

Instead, he seems to be trying really hard to display this 'holier than thou', 'Juve is dead to me, I don't give a damn about them' type of attitude.

-You do know Telecom Italia played a major role in the Calciopoli process by providing 'proof' such as phone recordings right?
-You do know that Provera quit his Telecom position just a month after Calciopoli had been concluded right? In September of 2006 to be exact.
-You do know that Telecom Italia and the SISMI (the Italian Military Intelligence and Security Service) were involved in a wire-tapping scandal which was uncovered in 2006 and consisted of more than 5000 individuals(journalists, football players, celebrities, fashion world figures, government employees etc) getting their phones recorded right?
-You do know that the above mentioned scandal saw Giuliano Tavaroli, the head of security of Telecom Italia, former head of security at Pirelli and the one who directed the wire-tappings get arrested for it in 2006 right?
-You do know that during Provera's reign at Telecom Italia, the latter company helped (in some cases more in some cases not so much) the SISMI in such world renowned scandals as the Abou Omar kidnapping, 'Nigergate' or the 'Niger Uranium forgeries' right?
-You do know that the Angelo Moratti-founded and owned Saras, of which Massimo is the CEO posted an equity of 1,29 billion Euros as part of their 2006 budget report right?

This is a “prize” you receive from this TV program for something stupid, or silly you have done. I know Buffon received one last year after the papera he did in one of the games. It seems to be done all in good fun. Here is the video, the whole thing is in Italian. I don't understand everything but they do say he need to learn from Inzaghi and Toni if he is going to dive. The other thing that I found great is that Krasic speaks very little italian but he knows how to say:

I just got back from class, ate, turned on my computer and saw this. Definitely surprised.

Thanks to everyone for your words but I really didn't do much. I listened to the phone calls (Tuttosport had both of the recordings up on their page yesterday-they actually posted something worthwhile for once!), read the texts of each and tried to offer a bit of an insight of my own.

I figured if I just copy and pasted the recordings in Italian, less people would have had the chance to read and truly comprehend what Pieri, Pairetto and Bergamo were saying.

My sole purpose was to share all of this with my fellow Juventini, the more of us know what really happened, the closer to the surface the truth will get.

I appreciate the suggestion for future posts and if the opportunity will arise (if school allows me also lol), I'd be more than glad to collaborate with Roberto and Aaron in a one-time Calciopoli-related article, although there's still a lot more to Calciopoli that I'd like to learn beforehand.

Ultimately, thanks to Aaron and Roberto whose tremendous work has continuously made this page not only the most visited page on the entire Offside but an excellent source for Juve-related information and discussion (well maybe that Milan samefag troll has been helping the last few days too lol).

This is what he had to say about the Krasic episode:

“Look, I don't know if I should call the decision made about Krasic through TV-proof and succeeding comments an idiocy or a load of bullshit (his words of choice were 'cazzata' and 'puttannata' lol). Since when is a player expected to come out and admit he actually dove? This might happen in the future generations, maybe in 2148! Now if the proper technology would have been present on the pitch, a real time decision could have been made, instead, they (the league) prefer to pay close attention to whether the managers are moving out of their designated areas on the sidelines! The 4th referee could prove useful if he had a monitor of sorts which he could use to better inform the head ref. If this would have been available in Krasic's case, he would have most likely gotten a yellow card for his gesture and still been present at San Siro against Milan.”

I hope for Juve, Milan, and really all of calcio that this ban is reversed. Even if for no other reason than it ended up having no effect on the outcome of the match.

The FIGC should consider the timing of the new trials and this crucifixion once again of the bianconeri.

* Someone suggested that Chiellini move to the left and PDC push forward. As I said in the last comment, I think this would probably a good idea. It all depends on whether PDC can contribute more to attack than defence. Anyways, it's a good sign that he seems to be improving on both fronts.

* Motta was very poor. He was caught out of position on several times and contributed nothing forward. At this rate, we are in the market for a right back.

* Don't agree that Martinez was good on Sunday. I remember that one run in which he slipped b/w two defenders and hit the side-netting, but nothing apart from that. That's OK for now, especially since he might not be fully fit.",Comrade88 ,"Oct 25, 2010 ", 11:42 PM,

(ca. 14:35). my opinion regarding this is, i'm all for putting PDC in more attacking role, i'm all for playing Legrottaglie, but for me the slight downside is that it would deprive us an already-established CB. i think this could only work for short term (esp. regarding Legro). for long term, i'd rather we look for a new LB than putting Keyser on the left and look for new CB, if we do want to establish PDC as LM that is..

2. agreed, but while Grygera's injured he's going to get a lot of playing time under his belt, therefore a huge chance to improve. we'll monitor his progress for sure

3. well, perhaps you cannot say 'good' but you can definitely say 'improved'. i missed watching a couple of earlier games this season where Martinez played so i might be wrong, but that was the first time i saw him attempting to take defenders on, and successful at that. i think the deathly stare from ADP in previous game has spurred him, lol",hant00 ,"Oct 26, 2010 ", 2:48 AM,

1. like shakespeare said , there's no art of telling the mind's construction from the face. perhaps in his mind krasic jumped (read dived!) to avoid contact ( and possible injury!) but on TV it did'nt come off like that. there'a sufficient eveidence from the replays to suggest that MMFK conned the referee and on those grounds the odds are that he will be punished.

i choose to ignore the comments of trolls and other variants of conspiracy theories. the FIGC will do what it will and muthaf****** can yada-yada all they want, BUT i am convinced krasic will come away from the incident a better & wiser player and even moreso that though Juventus' ressurgence may be delayed, we WILL return to the top

Last four games – Juve concede two goals, one to Salzburg, one to Manchester City, with cleansheets against Inter, Lecce & Bologna. That's with “bums” like PDC, Motta & Bonucci.

Milan. A goal from Napoli, two from Madrid & one from Chievo. Watching Papa get torn a new one v Lavezzi last night must have really hurt. Bonera? Yepes? Really?

In those same games Milans expensive, much vaunted world class attack has notched 5 goals. Juve's collection of has beens, never will be's & useless strikers has erm SIX.

The only way we can beat Milan is if we cut their midfield from passing and if we attack more than they do. Pato, Ronaldinho, Robinho and Ibrahimovic are not selfish players that will dedicate energies to defend, no matter what Allegri tells them.

Melo needs to pin Pirlo down, Bonucci has to cover Ronaldinho and Marchisio has to follow Robinho or Pato to the ends of the earth and back. I wish we had Krasic because our extra man in midfield will really help but oh well. I will go like this:

Motta—-Bonucci—-Chiellini—-De Ceglie
Marchisio—Aquilani—Melo—Martinez
————-Quagliarella—ADP—————
or

Pepe—-Bonucci—-Chiellini—-PDC
Marchisio——-Aquilani——-Melo
Quagliarella—-ADP——Martinez

We can win this if Delneri gives the players the right mentality. If Mourinho was our coach he will show the videos of players diving and not getting banned to all the players every day.

Their attack is scary if you look at the names but Robinho, Pato and to a lesser extent Ibrahimovic are very selfish players and that is why they don't score.

After those games we found a better formation placing Marchisio on the wing and moving Grygera to the RB position.

Last, Juve is not playing to win the Scudetto, Milan is. Juve came from a ridiculously bad season, Juve changed the management, coaching staff and players. Milan reinforced.

Those are the facts.

Does Milan have better individualities than Juve? Yes they do. Is Milan a world beater like the one from the early 90s or 2009 Barca or 2010 Inter, or 2004 Juve? No way.

Marotta went on Mediaset Premium Calcio, a cable calcio show.

A few things I read about it:

-Marotta talked about the Krasic case and how Juve are going to appeal it. Interestingly enough, Serse Cosmi who was also a guest on the show, defended Juve saying “I was listening to the game reports while driving in my car on Sunday and just moments after Krasic won the penalty the reporters were already discussing his gesture, how long he should get banned for etc.” Cosmi underlined how the media blew this out of proportion.

-Marotta said: “In January we are not going to make any huge moves but he will pay extra attention to sales and opportunities that will present themselves, especially players who have struggled to cement a spot while playing for big clubs.”

As some of you know, Pierluigi Pairetto and Paolo Bergamo were the 2 referee designators up until Calciopoli emerged on the scene in 06. As the 'scandal' became public, these two were chastised and believed to be part of the “Moggi System” which allowed Juve to monopolize the refereeing in Serie A (and to some extent even in C.L) to its benefit. They were both believed to be guilty while the media (Gazzetta dello Sport above all) helped display them as Moggi's servants.

On 12 December 2004, Juve played Bologna in the night game and the match was decided by a Nedved free kick from just outside the box with 4 minutes to go. The free kick was heavily discussed after the game, since some believed it to be an erroneous call, others found nothing wrong with it. The referee was Tiziano Pieri who was later found guilty for 'being part of the system' and banned from refereeing altogether at the age of 35 (referees can serve until 45, so he was banned at a very young age).

Today, 2 recorded phone calls emerged. They were both made the day after the game and one of them is between Bergamo and Pairetto, while the other is between Pieri and Pairetto. Here's the first one:

BERGAMO: Una bolgia è stata nel se condo. Undici leoni, anche nel primo tempo. Questi (quelli del Bologna, ndr) sono andati di già col nervosismo
PAIRETTO: Su quella punizione…
BERGAMO: Lui (Pieri, ndr) era molto lontano, uff.
PAIRETTO: Dice che ha tirato, è an che vero. Però lui (Ibra, ndr) allarga il braccio.
BERGAMO: il primo fallo lo fa Ibrahimovic.
PAIRETTO: Avevo detto: speriamo non segnino su questa punizione, te lo giuro.
BERGAMO: Io lo pensavo: sono quelle fischiate che poi… E' a trenta metri, che ti metti a fischiare. Aspettiamoci una valanga di polemiche.

The two designators discuss Pieri's decision to assign what ended up being the game-winning free kick. Bergamo shows his frustration as he hints that Pieri might have made a mistake while mentioning that the latter was very far from the foul itself and this made the decision very hard. Pairetto confesses that as he was watching the game he was hoping Juve wouldn't score because he knew that had that ball gone in a shitstorm would have ensued. Bergamo acknowledges this by saying: “Now we'll have to endure an avalanche of criticism and debate for this…” Keep in mind that these men were condemned as Moggi puppets and lots of people still believe they did everything in their power JUST to help Juve out.

Here's the second recorded phone call:

PIERI: Ho provato a chiamarti da ieri. Ho rivisto.
PAIRETTO: minchia questo episodio
PIERI: Ho fatto questo fischio perché ho visto questo fallo.
PAIRETTO: Tu hai mimato la tratte ìnuta
PIERI: Io ho visto… C'è Ibra… La since ra verità: per quello che è successo non lo rifischierei. …Ho mimato quello che ho visto. Se non riesce a saltare uno di una stazza così, però tornassi indietro non lo rifischierei. Il discorso che ti ho detto io: non lo ripeterei quel fischio. Quel fischio e quella rete hanno offusca to una buona gara.
PAIRETTO: Se facevi un ammonito di qua e uno di là, non avresti fatto male.
PIERI: Luci (l'osservatore, ndr) ha detto: fino al 40' avevi ragione te.
PAIRETTO: T'ha trattato male, forse era un eccesso.
PIERI: Pareva contento, quanto m'ha dato?
PAIRETTO: 8.20 (un voto molto bas so, ndr)
PIERI: Mi dispiace per questo fischio che magari mettono in difficoltà voi
PAIRETTO: Io non ho problemi: io non brigo, mai rotture di cazzo, non mi chiama Carraro. Me ne batto, non so altri…
PIERI: Figurati se gli davo un rigore al la Juve… Mi fucilavano.

This second recording throws the “Juve were favored thanks to Moggi's system of control” completely out the fucking window. Pieri claims in a disheartened manner to have seen a foul against Ibra (which led to the free kick) but confesses that with the huge criticism and discussion this decision ended up generating, if he could go back HE WOULD NOT call that foul. Pairetto tells him that he should have taken the safer route by giving a yellow to each side and avoided this criticism. Pieri asks Pairetto what rating Luci, the referee observer (the person who grades refs on their performances) gave him and he once again seems disheartened that he was given an 8.20 (a very low rating) due to this dubious call. Pieri then offers his apologies to Pairetto by saying: “I'm sorry if this call of mine has caused you (Bergamo and Pairetto) any trouble” and ends the conversation saying: “Imagine if I would have given a pk to Juve, they would have rifled/executed me!”.

Again, these 3 men were all believed to have been under Moggi's control and the media-generated opinion on them was that they used all the power vested in them to favor Juventus. The above phone calls, make this notion seem laughable at best.

I am a Milanista, and I hope not a total douchebag. I agree with everything about Milan in the podcast, except I like Abbiati. He has made some incredible saves this year. He has had to. We have no defense. Our only hope is to maintain possession and feed the ball to our strikers, other than that we are screwed. I don't even know how we are in 2nd place. (But I'm not complaining, a scudetto is always nice!)

I hope for Juve's sake the Krasic ban is overturned, I would rather lose w/ Krasic than win without him. I also hope Del Piero plays a lot for the same reason. It's not sport if it's not sporting.

To that end, this week is always interesting, as I am married to a Juventino. I guess it's good in a way, because we either draw or one of us wins!

VotD: Because these obviously didn't deserve bans,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 25, 2010, 9:09am PDT",,"I actually think Krasic should get a ban. Not because that's fair or other silly arguments like that, but because it might teach him a lesson. He looks like a pretty intelligent guy, and according to Aquilani's words Krasic feels bad for the incident. IMO a ban might make him think it twice before trying that again.

I know that diving is (sadly) part or nowadays football, and I can even see why someone would “dive” after a soft foul (you are getting kicked the whole game, it's a way to show the opponent they can't foul you whenever they want), but dives like the one in our last game are too much.

It's kinda tricky, because sometimes you actually get fouled and if you don't fall the referee won't give you the penalty, and it kinda makes sense (or I'm deluding myself to believe it makes sense) what Marotta said, that probably Krasic thought he was going to get fouled (as he usually is) so he fell, but he never got fouled. I can get behind that (like you have to play one step ahead of your opponent all the time, so you even react to the foul before getting fouled, if that makes sense), but if you don't get fouled when you thought you would be I think one should get on their feet and if the referee already gave the penalty, correct him and tell him that you didn't get fouled.

Sometimes players dive when there is minimal contact but yesterday there was not contact. I for one was glad that Iaquinta missed the penalty. If we are good enough we will win fair and square, if not we shouldn't. I see what Aaron is saying by posting the videos and I hope Krasic learned his lesson regardless of whether he gets banned or not. He knows he is important to this team and missing a couple games with us on such a stupid thing should make him learn his lesson.

I was also reading some posts from yesterday and people were discussing whether PDC will look as good if Marchisio wasn't playing ahead of him. I am going to say he looked just fine yesterday when Martinez came on. Martinez was sent to attack and PDC really held his own. Will he become the best LB, probably not, but he should help us get that 4th spot. What concerns me is whether Marotta will buy Ziegler or not. That will certainly add much needed depth in the LB position, but would that hurt De Ceglie's confidence?. With that being said, I think PDC can play as a LW if Ziegler is bought.

Lastly, a few posts back Papai said that we should not even be saying the word scudetto and I wholeheartedly agree. After the last month we have shown that we can play some good football and win the games (Lecce, Udinese), bad football and loose games (Palermo), and good football and loose games (Bologna). That is what teams that make Europa League or that squeeze into 4th place do. In the next few markets we need to become a team that can play bad football and still win games, that's what will make us scudetto contenders.

This team needs a lot of work but at least I feel we are in good hands. It took four years for Secco to undo everything good that Moggi did for this team. I hope it doesn't take that long to be back to where we belong.",Jose ,"Oct 25, 2010 ", 3:18 PM,

-I'm disappointed with this game but I'm not feeling down, though. I always believe that in teamsports (eg. football, NBA, NFL), defense wins championships and we improve tremendously compared to last season AND the start of this season.

-The lack of a world-class prima punta will loose us some points this season, but with the improved midfield (this season's rate:A, last season: C) and defense (this season: C, last season: D) we have a better chance to win the winnable games.

-Look at the goals we scored vs conceded. In Aug, our record was 0-1 (1 game, lost). In Sep, it was 16-12 in 6 games (2wins, 3draws, 1lost). In Oct so far, it is 5-1 in 4 games (1win, 3draws).

-It is obvious we are much improved in defense but still looking for the right balance between attacks and defense. So as long as there are no major injuries knock on wood 3x, I'm not worried about top 4 by the end of the season.",dwicarta ,"Oct 25, 2010 ", 2:42 AM,

It's not about luck as mufin already said. It's just that we're missing that magic upfront that can drag you through those difficult games with one moment of brilliance. I bet your ass we would've won this game with Dz…

I'm not thrilled about having De Ceglie in front of the supposedly defensively weak Traoré. De Ceglie should hold his position while finally delivering good performances. But I'm still doubting since he only seems to play like that when covered by Marchisio. But that means we're losing the chance to field a natural winger there.

And we need more than just Aquilani. Pepe would do a better job at LM compared to Marchisio if you ask me. Since he can combine the defensive work and attack when needed. So buy him, even as a fullback he may come in handy. Aquilani of course. Quagliarella hasn't done great, but I'd buy him anyway. We can not judge Traoré, Motta or Rinaudo yet, so give them some time. And keep in mind that when we strenghten again, they'll probably be players on our bench. We do NOT need any Messi's or Chiellini's sitting there.

Secondly with Giovinco coming back from injury; I couldn't help but to think what would've been if he was still with us. One of the problems he was confronted with at Juve was a much less creative squad than the one we have right now with Aquilani, Krasic and even an in-form Melo. This always hurts players like him, it pressurises them to deliver while being tightly marked and fouled by the opposition. About the same happened to Diego, but he was the 25 mil transfer, so he wasn't benched as easily.

Bologna v. Juventus: Tell Me We're Still Ok...,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 24, 2010, 12:04am PDT",,"Here's my pagelle stuff for tonight:

Amauri – Not too bothered about his injury…nuff said..

Iaq – Here's a request…please change the blog's URL to juventus.theiaquinta.com!!!! He was caught offside SO MANY times, even his mother was seen entering the stands and screaming at him!

Quags – Will be packed up and sent soon enough, but he wasn't as bad as the others…atleast he wasn't trigger-shy

ADP – Too slow, but we already knew that…and his form has dipped alarmingly since the Salzburg game…

Aquilani – Good show, did as much as was required and kept peppering the ball to the strikers' feet and heads….

Melo – A couple of mistakes aside, is showing his consitency and his workmanship in the middle with Aquilani.

Marchisio – Contrary to what the others would think, he actually had a pretty tactically sound game and is showing his versatility and quality on his touches. Scuffed one from outside the D, but overall decent in winning the ball back and made a few good passes… the sad part is, I think he's feeling a little miserable coz of Aquilani's form and praise…. he needs someone to talk to….anyone game for a one on one at Vinovo? :)

MMFK – Good touches and good pace…but looked tired and out of sorts.

Martinez – looked less nervy compared to the EL game and ran a lot to hassle Busce…but not worth anything in defence. Did a pretty little manouvre between two defenders late in the game but blasted it wide…decent try for someone who's returning from injury.

PDC – My player of the day – Didn't put a STEP wrong and seems to slowly learn the art of positioning and communication in the defence…have a strange feeling the reason is Storari (he's contantly shouting out orders in PDC's direction…. one positive from an otherwise worrying scenario. It was only bologna, but at least he's marching along his learning curve.

Bonucci – His lack of speed was crudely exposed by Di Vaio and Jiminez… and his late tackles are going to be costly some day…. he needs to put in a LOT more to really make himself worthy of us…

Chiello – His performances, like today, are usually never as great as the charisma and confidence he brings to the defence. He didn't have too much to do except clean up the loose balls and talk to his defence. Did it perfectly.

Motta – Naive. Can attack, hasn't learnt the D of defence. Was made to literally spin on his toes by Jiminez…kind of insulting for a defender really.

Storari – What a committed man and what a committed save! His save literally kept us on our wasteful toes! Good stuff Marco!

Ref – Piss-poor refereeing and was constantly calling fouls based on player protests….takes me back to a calcio a decade ago :)

GDN: Have a LOT to say on him..but will reserve until my cockles are calmer.",vidder911 ,"Oct 24, 2010 ", 3:08 PM,

At this point, I think Libertazzi and Gianetti couldn't be any worse than Amauri or Iaquinta. Last season, we thought the problem was poor supply to our strikers. This season, we realize our strikers are simply awful. By January, we need to get rid of one of Amauri or Iaquinta and get a new striker. The wing back positions used to be the most pressing need but now, if we don't get new strikers, fourth place may become pretty far despite the fact that we currently sit in fifth.

As for the reported shameful diving by Krasic, well, what can I say, he did get a penalty for it (and I hope nothing worse eventually). Iaquinta fluffs the penalty. That is discouraging to say the least.",Godson Hernandez ,"Oct 24, 2010 ", 4:34 PM,

Ciro Ferrara appointed Italy U-21 Coach,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 22, 2010, 9:21am PDT",,"Here's my read on it.

Zaccheroni said Del Piero never asked to play, never pressured him or anything. Ferrara never explicitly said “Del Piero pressured me” but said “it becomes a problem when he wants to play all the time.” And Zaccheroni said this to the Gazzetta the other day:

Do you see what's happening at Roma between Ranieri and Totti? It will punish them. Ranieri does what he likes, and he has all the right to. But the conflict between two personalities that strong does not help the team. Either the two come to an agreement, and Roma becomes strong, or Roma breaks down. Ale is totally different from Totti. I say it, because it's a reality that I have experienced first-hand. Del Piero would do anything to win with Juve. And by “anything” that also includes to accept without the bench without complaining, and to score decisive goals entering late in the game. Ale is not a danger, he is a huge added value.""


Del Piero and Ferrara both can't really be taken for their words, because they obviously have a vested interest. Zaccheroni has no reason to say anything but the truth, he's in Japan now so it doesn't matter what he says. I think Zaccheroni is right, but Ferrara isn't lying.

Essentially, Del Piero has a strong desire to play, always. And as he says, that's a good thing, it would be a problem if he didn't. Ferrara, given his inexperience and friendship with Del Piero and other members of the squad, probably felt pressure that might not have existed. He might have imagined Del Piero was challenging his authority, because the idea “Ferrara can't manage friends” was repeated so much in the media. If Del Piero asks in the locker room, “Am I playing today?” Zaccheroni, or a normal coach might interpret that as a simple question. It's easy to see how to Ferrara, a friend of Alex, that might be looked at as a pressuring question.



Hope that kind of explains my thoughts.",agiamba ,"Oct 22, 2010 ", 3:25 PM,

Ciro Ferrara appointed Italy U-21 Coach,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 22, 2010, 9:21am PDT",,"I don't know if Ferrara is the best choice simply because of the stance he had with youth players while managing Juventus. His stern refusal to play Giovinco even when the player had put in starting-11 worth performances was another aspect of his failure as a manager and judge of talent.

And Giovinco wasn't the only young player dismissed by Ferrara. De Ceglie also had difficulty getting playing time. He would put in a decent substitute display one week, start the next week, and simply because of one mistake he would be left off the pitch for the following months. Is that how a manager should treat younger players?

If the objective of the FIGC is to move forward with youth and have a new Italian Renaissance, then how does Ferrara's record with young players fit in? Also, let's not forget that last season under Ferrara, Giovinco was 22. That's the same age as Lionel Messi. I'm not comparing talent here, but I am saying that if Ferrara was in charge of Barcelona, he may have looked at Messi and thought “not enough experience”, “too small”, “lacks physicality”, etc. If the FIGC really means what it says about relaunching the Azzurri, it will require people who actually believe in the new generation of players.",Alvi ,"Oct 22, 2010 ", 10:38 PM,

Diego got injured against Lazio, before that game we played a 4-3-1-2, a fomation which couldnt accomodate both Diego & Seba. Once Diego got injured, Seba was used as trequartista against Bordeaux, Genoa & Livorno. Thing is that, he failed miserably in all 3 games which led to his benching when Diego got back from injury. Was he given enough time ? Probably not. But he did get to play.



He was reinstated when we tried the 4-2-3-1, had a couple of great games against Napoli & Sampdoria. Against Napoli Camo got injured after 30 mins, he was replaced by Tiago, which destroyed the shape & Juve went on to lose 3-2. He still played as LW, till Alex came back from injury.



Alex came back from injury in the Udinese game, Seba was promptly benched (to go by Ciro's version, he had to play Alex). Alex didnt play well as LW against Udinese, so we went back to 4-3-1-2, with no Giovinco. He got injured a few games later & was ruled out for the season.



I dont agree with the fact that Ciro was not going to use young players. In fact he gave chances to Marrone, Rossi & Iago during pre-season. Marrone got his Serie A debut against Chievo in Matchday-1. I think Ciro lost the plot so much with the senior players that he never got the chance to experiment with juniors. It's his fault in the end of the day, he neither had the man-management skills nor tactical ability to infuse those guys in first team. Just that I dont think he was reluctant to use young players, he was held back by his other limitations to use them more.



There was a time when De Ceglie would have come on as sub for ANY player in the hour mark. At times it made no sense. And lets be fair here, Paolo has never really been impressive for a run of 2-3 games. He is looking good under GDN, but thats the difference between an experienced & inexperienced coach.

3. Move Pepe (which I just wrote a piece on this morning following Pepe's comments.

3. Buffon gets sold for no less than €20m, which, even if the Glazers free up the money is a sum Manchester needs to spend in midfield not goals

4. Does Buffon actually want to leave & do Juve really want to sell the YOUNGEST keeper in our squad.

5. We all love him, but to the outside world he is an injury prone 33 yr old (when window opens) coming of yet another operation, this time on his back – always risky surgery. Not expected to play until February. Surely far too risky esp when Manchester refused to find the money for a much safer not to mention nessacary addition in Ozil

Salzburg v. Juventus: Unleash The Martinez,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 21, 2010, 8:55am PDT",,"I watched the whole first half and only a part of the second half.

- By the looks of it we need Krasic, Melo, and Aquilani a lot more than I thought.
- The team in the first half looked like last years, no creativity and lacking grinta and desire. Delneri has to make sure to tell his players that even though we are aiming for 4th place with this type of display we won't get far.
- Martinez looked super nervous, at least at first. The problem with buying a player that did good for a club like Catania is that he might not be able to cope with the pressure of a big club (think Almiron). I hope we didn't pay 12m for another Almiron. The guy has quality, but he was super scared today, which is weird since he played fine against Manchester City.
- Bonucci has quite a bit to learn before becoming world class
- Chiellini was a beast again

- We have talked lots about Amauri in recent days, whether he can help this team or not. Here is what I saw today. The team focused on playing long balls hoping Amauri will work his magic. That makes us super predictable. I don't know if he played long balls because that is all our fullbacks and midfielders can do in the absence of Aquilani and Krasic. Playing Amauri with long balls and crosses makes us a poor team. Having Krasic, Aquilani and Del Piero (or even Quagliarella) makes us unpredictable, and thus a better team.

Amauri is not Drogba who can hold on to a ball and run meters and score. Amauri slows us down and makes us predictable.

Today we saw what someone in the podcast was saying… When we have a tough game, we need a guy who can invent a goal out of nowhere. Amauri is not it.

- Last, I think this team more than Krasic dependent will become Aquilani dependent. This highlights the stupidity of Secco (not ever buying a regista) and how fragile we can be. If Krasic and Aquilani don't show up we will suffer.",Jose ,"Oct 21, 2010 ", 7:03 PM,

Well this game proves even krasic cant do much if u have amauri upfront.

Martinez – 4 – ineffective in everything he did. Maybe he will get better with playing time.
ADP – 5 – was stranded, but missed a couple of chances, and generally freekicks were not ADP like
Amauri – 2 – The couch on which i was sitting was more into the game than him. Whining chance missing slow running skill lacking POS
KRASIC – 7 – Shows he cared, head and shoulders above the rest of the team.Should have buried his second chance too.

I couldn't find full highlights of the game but I was able to watch a short video of Salzburg's goal, while reading the post-match comments here and on VS. From what I've gathered:

-Grygera and Sissoko (the latter especially) seemed to be at fault for the goal.

-Pepe played like shit and didn't contribute for anything at all, maybe my consideration of him being a poor man's Di Livio is fucking retarded?

-Amauri was worthless, again.

This official statement was posted (still there) on PSV Eindhoven's webpage today (Google translated):

PSV Ibrahim Afellay have jointly concluded that, for several reasons, it is unrealistic to have his contract extended. As a technical manager Marcel Brands said on Friday the Herdgang. PSV Afellay will now jointly review the best possible options.


""Reasonable allowance for the club '
The conversation between the club and the player, according to Brands' constructively and in good spirit ""expired. PSV hereby regret to find that an end to the long-term relationship in sight, but is satisfied with the arrangements because Ibrahim Afellay has pledged to make every effort to PSV would not leave without a reasonable allowance for the club. PSV hopes this season as long as possible to benefit from the captain. Ibrahim Afellay has confirmed these agreements and looks forward to the upcoming matches with PSV. Ambition to relocate next steps to be independent of his great loyalty to PSV and the PSV supporters.

-Long story short, Afellay will most likely be sold in January. Over the summer, when he still had 1 year in his contract his price was ~10 million, I'm sure PSV will probably ask for much less than that in January, probably like 6-7, since he could move on a free just months later.

From what I've gathered, he's an Italian writer, journalist and TV journeyman who has worked for Rai, Canale 5 and various other media.

Since 2003 he's been one of the analysts on the football TV show “Il Processo di Biscardi” and although I had seen Aldo Biscardi's show a couple times way back when, I didn't remember Moncalvo as an analyst.

He's apparently a HUGE Juve fan and wrote a book titled “I Lupi e gli Agnelli”, which depicts the power struggle within the Agnelli/Elkann family, while highlighting its effects on Juve's leadership as a club and reactions to Farsopoli.

Dzeko to Juventus: Is The Deal Done?,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 20, 2010, 3:28pm PDT",,"I agree with a lot of what Moncalvo says. But I think Storari was a good signing and it doesn't make sense to judge Martinez yet. Maybe he doesn't think Martinez is good enough for Juve, but Juve had limited funds, and we needed to bring in enough wingers for depth purposes. Lets see how he does before we judge him.

And while Juve could have consulted Moggi for transfer advice, knowing how the FIGC works, we'd likely get a fine or ban for it. And is he suggesting that we should have sold Buffon and signed Ibrahimovic? Because that is madness lol.

And while Lippi didn't really help Juve's cause at the world cup, I don't think it's right to blame him.

But I definitely agree that a more competent sporting director could have done a lot more with 200 million euro than Blanc did. Let him finish the stadium project that he's been overseeing since he arrived at Juve, then we can let him go.

And I agree that Nedved should be on the bench with the team. He'll be able to help a lot there. But I'm also glad he's on the board of directors. He might be a minority there (like Tardelli was), but we need to get the right people in there one at a time. It can't all happen over night.

And I agree that Andrea Agnelli should be given more power by Elkann to make decisions on his own. Maybe in time that will happen. In any case, his presence there is a huge step in the right direction. It looks like the Elkann's and Agnelli's could be making amends. I don't know all the details about that though.

I agree with everything else Moncalvo says too.",Anthony ,"Oct 21, 2010 ", 2:42 AM,

But winning in the Europa League will at least help Juve's rep. And the Europa League and the Coppa Italia are probably the only trophies we have a realistic chance of winning this year.

I'd rather win those than win nothing. And it'll at least help our prestige a bit. Our team needs to get back into the habit of winning no matter what the competition is.

A brief summary of why;

Firstly he says Nedved & Marotta won't make a difference at the CdA. Agnelli knows both men well & given his relationship with Nedved of course they will agree & get the board making football decisions instead of pure business ones. He also says they will only be 2 members out of 8, but the CdA is being expanded from 7 to 11 so who knows where he gets 8 from.

Moggi says Storari, Pepe & Martinez are not Juve quality? Leaving aside the fact that Moggi has not been involved in football transfers for almost 5 years & almost everytime he speaks he shows how out of touch he is (remember this man said Bonucci is SLOWER than Cannavaro TODAY!!!) Storari was Serie A's best keeper last year, Pepe is a typical Juve player. From Ferrara, Di Livio, Torricelli, Juve has been made of hardworking versatile & dedicated players like Pepe. Martinez is a class act & once he is fit & on form Moggi will eat those words like he has on Krasic.

Speaking of Krasic. Juve should sign Jonathan??? Really? At the expense of the non EU spot now owned by the Serb??? Right…….

The day of Del Neri's appointment as Juve coach, the average comment was something like: “Mamma mia, come siamo messi male! Dovevamo prendere Benitez che e un ottimo allenatore e abbiamo preso uno sconosciuto incapace che non e mai stato alla guida di una grande squadra e che non ne capisce un cazzo di tattiche!!!1 Il 4/4/2 e un suicidio, la Juve lottera per non retrocedere e noi moriremo tutti!!!”

After Lecce's game, the same individual as above: “Ancora una volta, Delneri ha mostrato di essere un grande allenatore! Il schieramento di Marchisio come mezz'ala sinistra ha avuto gran successo e il mister ha dimostrato di capirne alla grande quando si tratta di tattica!

PotD: Welcome to Torino...,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 20, 2010, 9:21am PDT",,"You are right about his age, he is 28, born same year as I was as it turns out.

I still think we should look at younger players that can make a difference rather than buy a guy that will be 29 by next season (I learned my lesson). Don't get me wrong, Cassano is good, very good, I daresay the best in Italy right now in that position but he will not be at the top for long. ADP is 36 and he is doing great, but had it not been for Calciopoli he would have been a wonder sub by the age of 32 or 33. And if you ask me, Del Piero at 28 and 29 years of age was better than Cassano at 28 or 29, hands down.

I think we should give our youth a little bit of a chance instead of spending 25m on Cassano, or 60m in Pastore (according to Zamparini that is his price tag… the guy is crazy). Bringing Pasquato, or Immobile will allow us to give them play time and if they don't turn out to be all that they were hyped out to be we will sell them for a much higher profit than if we take Immobile from Siena and then sell him to Empoli, to then buy him back in a year… and so on.

Bojan Krkic started in 2007 when he was 17 years of age. He is now 20 and has 20 goals to his name in 83 appearances (according to Wikipedia). I don't think Krkic is the next Messi, or the next Trezeguet or Henry. He is good but that is all he will be. Now, look at his price tag. When they sell him they will make a much larger profit than we will make from Giovinco. Now Barca are doing the same thing with Pedro. If Pedro turns out to be the next big thing they will keep him, if not they will sell him in 2 years for a large profit.

I am not denying Cassano's ability. Between keeping our line up or adding Cassano, I will certainly go for adding him. But I rather see a fifth striker that can grow with us and be our next star for 10 – 15 years or someone that we can sell 3 years down the road for some obscene amount of money than Cassano who will be a wonder sub in 3 or 4 years time.",Jose ,"Oct 20, 2010 ", 6:32 PM,

He's got the physique, good speed and great technique too. Out of the 3 I mentioned, the best option to ADP. His goalscoring ability is ridiculous and he would probably be the cheapest of those 3 also.

If the rumors about Andrea being obsessed and willing to spend 30 million on Neymar are true, I don't get why we don't push for Suarez instead. For 25 million cash, Ajax would pay for his airfare themselves.

-Jovetic is another really good option but Corvino would try to make us go bankrupt. He's not very prolific either though, 112 games played, 32 goals and 27 assists (still very respectable for a 20 year old).

-I kind of just threw Pastore in the mix simply because he has stunned me this season with his performances. You are right he's not a seconda punta or a distinct goal-scorer but this season he has been banging goals in at an impressive ratio. 7 games, 4 goals in Serie A. Also the most expensive.

-Although I'm not too crazy about the whole Cassano move, I'd be happy if he came as long as we get Dzeko first.

He helped in the fluidity up front with his exchanges with krasic. I couldn't see much of the game but I think he is better than previous seasons and I'd pick him over the static iaquinta any day. On the issue of marchisio and aqua I think the aqua-melo partnership is working well and they provide an effective block to central play, which will clearly be seen against milan on the 30th. I'd hate to lose another primavera player but I can't say that I haven't dreamed of the day aqua would play for juve and play well. As for giovinco, I think he is a bit unlucky. He is the best parma player and the moment he gets injured you can see them crumble. It's too early to talk about giovinco. But one thing is for sure, I'd have loved to see Krasic and him play on the same side and rip defenses apart. For that though juve need a better LB than the present douchebags.

I'd like to have him back with us next year, although I'm sure Parma will use their option to purchase half of his rights at the end of the season. I don't see him as ADP's heir now or ever. They are different players on many aspects and although Seba has undeniable talent and has been unlucky due to injuries and being continuously overlooked the last 2-3 years, ADP at his age was much more decisive and already well-established. If in the early stages of his career Seba looked like a miniature ADP, the gap that exists between the two has increased the last few years greatly.

I'll admit that I'm still just as concerned with his frail physique and injury proneness as I was before however, especially since it hasn't gotten any better over the years. He plays for 5-6 weeks, is injured for 2-3.

Either way, as long as a top notch prima punta (Dzeko) is purchased next summer and Gio is recalled, I'd be fine with us not even buying a new seconda punta, sending back Quagliarella and using Gio, Martinez and ADP as seconda puntas.

“Allow me to explain Del Piero's situation at Juve on a wider scale. You see what's happening at Roma between Totti and Ranieri? It's a constant 'tug-o-war'. Ranieri does what he feels like and he has every right to do so, but the conflict between two characters as strong as those two doesn't help the team. Such a scenario doesn't allow for compromise or a draw. Either the opponents reach an agreement and Roma becomes much better or 'the toy (Roma)' breaks under all the pressure.”

“Ale is completely different from Totti and I say this from personal experience. Del Piero would do anything just to win with Juve, and with anything I mean even accepting a bench role without complaining, while coming on as a sub in the last minutes and scoring the winning goal. Instead of being a nuisance, Alex adds great value.”

-Found this pretty interesting and relevant, since we're talking about ADP's and Gio's roles within the team and there have always been some people who have accused Del Piero of being a locker room problem.

I think with Aquilani adding a whole new dimension to the team with his passing, and Melo playing as well as he has, Del Neri is trying to accommodate all three or Marchisio, Aquilani and Melo in the team. It's hard to leave any of them out of the team at the moment, and moving Marchisio to the wing/sort of left-center mid is probably the best way to accommodate it. The alternative is leaving him out of the starting line up altogether, because based on Melo and Aquilani's form…it's hard to argue Marchisio should take one of their spots.

I doubt he'll be a Del Piero replacement, but there's no reason he can't have an important role still.

I think Giovinco plays best as a winger in a 4-3-3. He wouldn't have as much defensive responsibility as in a 4-4-2, and he would wouldn't really be expected to score 15-20 goals a season from that position either. He'd mostly be expected to provide assists.

So really, I think the need for a fantasista seconda punta depends on the formation the team eventually plays. If they continue to play 4-4-2, then we definitely need a seconda punta. Cassano, for the right price, would be good. But I think he might be too expensive, and we need to focus our funds on signing a prima punta first (+ a fullback).

Jovetic would probably be perfect, like you guys said. Its a shame he plays for Fiorentina and is pretty much an impossibility. And I agree with you guys that Giuseppe Rossi isn't really a super creative type seconda punta, but I think he would still be a good investment.

"Podcast: Episode Seven- So Amauri, Marchisio, Giovinco & Cassano Walk Into A Bar…",The Offside Juventus,"Oct 19, 2010, 1:45pm PDT",,"First of all, thank you guys for the podcast, Juve is a great team full of great devoted people like you. Keep up the good work.

Second. I don't think Giovinco can or will ever be the player that Del Piero was. Someone commented on the podcast that Seba had to compete with ADP or Nedved for a place in the team, but if you all remember correctly, Del Piero had to compete against Baggio for a place in the team. Giovinco is a good player, but at 24 he is no longer a promise. I think he is skilled, and fast but unfortunately too small for the modern game. On top of that he seems to fall as soon as he is touched which I really dislike. If you see Messi play, he can get kicked, pushed, and grabbed, but he stays on his feet and scores.

With that being said I think he can be super helpful to our team. He can play both as a left winger or a seconda punta and will certainly help us when after 60 minutes we can't break the deadlock. Our left attacking winger players are PDC, Traore (both can play at LM), Marchisio, Pepe, and Martinez. Giovinco is certainly better than any of them when it comes down to attacking. This however means that at 25 he will come to a team and accept a substitute role, which at the time I find highly unlikely.

Third. Amauri is slow, super slow, slower than molasses. He is helping the team by holding the ball and giving Krasic space but he is certainly not a player that Juve should be fielding on a regular basis or one to put too much confidence in for the future. I said it last year and I will say it this year. I would prefer having Immobile playing Amauri's role, the kid will bring as much as Amauri and he has potential for improvement. Immobile is now playing at Siena so that is the end of that story. So now I say, play Libertazzi instead of Amauri, he can't be more useless and can only improve. As much as I liked seeing Del Piero score his 178th goal with the black and white shirt I think the substitution should have been Amauri for a young gun. We were winning 3-0, Lecce looked like they rather be having supper with their families, the game was done and over by the first 45 minutes. Why not give a kid a chance?. Kids also play with so much more passion at that age that it can hide their lack of technical ability.

Fourth. Let's look in house for solutions before we go and pay a pretty penny for the next soccer rock star (I am looking at you Neymar). Dzeko is someone we have an eye on, and I think we will try for him next year. If we get him we will be set for years in the forward department. It will also mean that most of our transfer budget will be gone (30m for Dzeko and 16m for Aquilani). I know the deals will be staggered and we will end up paying about 10 or 15 m for Dzeko and 5 or 6m for Aquilani but still we have to consider salaries and their cost in the long term. Assuming we don't fix our fullbacks (which we will), Juve won't have money to buy Cassano, let alone Jovetic or Suarez, or Neymar. That might be a blessing in disguise. Let's look at our own academy and give Pasquato a chance, he has scored 5 goals in 6 games for Modena. Is he the next Baggio or Del Piero, probably not, but he will come for free and will come with the right attitude, and… who knows, he might be what we need. I leave you with a video of one of our own that will come for free. Forza Juve, and thanks again for the podcast

A quick look through the top rated You-Tube clips of Giovinco, which can make Zebina look like Maldini, & its hard to find an example of him beating a man with pace. Yes he creates chances from trequartista, scores goals from set pieces & has amazing technical skills but none of that changes the fact he cannot create seperation from a defender.

I never said he had a bad season, I said he did quite well. Its just an honest assessment of a kid I've watched grow up through the ranks, I'm not asking anyone to agree with me, I call it how I see it, nothing more.

I guess until he plays a dozen games in a row for Juventus some people will refuse to believe it, & thats ok, if we all agreed with everything each other said this comments section (& the podcasts!) would be pretty dull right?

If he comes back & plays brilliantly I'll be the first to hold my hands up & say I got it wrong, & I'll be as happy as anyone to see him succeed in Bianconeri. I dont see it happening.",Adam Digby ,"Oct 20, 2010 ", 5:02 AM,

"Podcast: Episode Seven- So Amauri, Marchisio, Giovinco & Cassano Walk Into A Bar…",The Offside Juventus,"Oct 19, 2010, 1:45pm PDT",,"Great Podcast as always! My random thoughts:

1. Why spend so much time talking about Amauri? Basically, you all agreed that:
- He played well against Lecce;
- He's not a great prima punta (and that's one of the reason why we're not a scudetto material this season) but he did his job;
- In a game when we're not playing well, we won't be able to rely on him to win the match (and again, that's one of the reason why we're not a scudetto material this season); and
- Hence, I think all of you agreed that we needed a much better prima punta next season.

2. In 4-4-2, aquilani-melo beats out marchisio-melo, at least so far.
- I think it's not a coincidence that we play our best games with marchisio—aquilani—melo—krasic in the midfield. To me, marchisio-aquilani linked up beautifully to create attacks and marchisio also did well to cover PDC. Pepe didn't link up as well as those two did.
- We'll see more clearly this thursday when aquilani doesn't play and we have pepe—marchisio—melo—krasic.

3. I agree that ADP is not a fantasista; he's a seconda punta, a great seconda punta. Cassano on the other hand, is a fantasista; technically a great fantasista (and not a bad seconda punta, too) but honestly, I don't want him @juve:
- Aaron said that he's changed a lot but I respectfully disagree;
- He's not as professional as ADP is and he's a 29 who'd already-slept-with-1000 girls, he admitted, so I don't think he'll be at the same level he is now in five years time, which makes his price unreasonable.

It's no doubt that we've improved sine the start of the season. It's also no doubt that there's still some work to be done. And its also no doubt that the Del Neri/Marotta skeptics are starting to recheck their views. This team is obviously far better than the team of last season and one thing obvious in this team is the fighting spirit Del Neri seems to have brought back to Juve. Believe it or not those eleven players that joined us from the last mercato are partly reason for that.

Last season's Juve was full of players who had won something and had proved to the world that they were really good, once upon a time. Most of those players simply had nothing to prove and not much reason to play well other than to justify their salaries. So it was hardly surprising Canna could still smile after we lost matches last season. He was probly thinkin; “hey, i've won the scudetto several times before, won the La Liga, the world cup and the world player of the world award. No matter how bad I get, it can't take those away from me” Trez, Camo and Grosso had all won something and had proved themselves for both club and country. Even if they played crap (which some did), didn't change the fact that they had already established themselves as world class players.

This season's Juve has players that are yet to fully prove themselves, lots of them. It's probly why we see so much spirit in he team, cos all the players know the team's success is their success and it's failure, theirs. They're playing both for Juventus and their careers.

As for Diego's exit, I have a theory. Last season, Diego was seen as our only creative option up top and a lot of times our attack had to go through him. Marotta probly reasoned that if Diego stayed, there would still be some unconscious dependence on Diego for creativity, especially among players that played for us last season and still remain in the team. His total absence would mean there would be no way players would depend on him if he wasn't there. That said, it doesn't justify the amount he was sold for.

Some people are skeptical about much of our goals coming from midfielders. I'm concerned too, but in a way it's a good thing. Means that our goal threats come from more than one player (though effectively marking Krasic could reduce that) and we don't have to depend on one player alone for goals so even if one player fails to show up in a match, others still get to score. We still win, right? :)

Phew, long post, long read but got that off my chest. I believe this team can only grow and with an Edin Dzeko (yup, really big fan of his. Won't hang myself if he doesn't join us though) and really good full backs, we'll be back to our best.

I also won't mind Cassano. Rossi's good but I think Cassano would be closer to an ADP than Rossi or pretty much anyone else.

true, unproven players will always have extra hunger, but that doesn't mean we should expect less from established players. in my opinion that's the difference between a successful player (you mentioned Canna) and a true bandiera/legend (those old guards that stay through thick and thin with their spirit intact). they'd never care how successful they were already and always strive for more for the club

about your theory on Diego's exit:
well, the same thing could potentially happen with MMFK27 if your reasoning's like that (and you've hinted as much). we've yet to see the team go for an extended period without him this season, and i think Delneri has already acknowledged this “problem” with his statement before cagliari game. we shall see how he will overcome this dependency, which i now believe that he can, and he will..

as for Diego's price, i suppose the justification came from what i perceived as indecision on management's part to sell him or not that went all summer long (which also sparked my i-won't-support-Juve-anymore-if-Diego's-sold fiasco). eventually, he was sold near the end of transfer window, not unlike a panic sell, and that took a chunk out of his proper value",hant00 ,"Oct 20, 2010 ", 12:09 PM,

Ever noticed that some times during games it seems like Krasic is being ignored by the rest of the team? I don't think it's cos they don't like him. I think Del Neri wants the team to look for other creative options than Krasic and in so doing probably asks the team to keep the ball away from him sometimes so he doesn't appear to and become our only source of creativity. While it does look like he is, I think Del Neri is trying to work out a system that will make creativity come from both wings and not just from Krasic. He already previously stated that the team is not Krasic dependent and, i'm sure, is constantly trying to get the team to create more chances with less of Krasic's input.

As for true legends, well a team only has few of them at any point in time and of course, their time too comes to an end. To that end we still see ADP and Gigi being part of the team. Trez was getting injured , Camo too was injured and his temper was becoming a bit of a problem. They both had to go and in due course, so will ADP and Super Gigi.

He would have been a good edition to the team though of course. But I think Quagliarella will score more goals than Diego would have. Diego would have gotten more service to the strikers though….but I don't know how much getting extra service to Amauri is going to do.

If we had a striker like Dzeko that Diego and Krasic could be feeding with assists, then yeah, that would be incredible. There is also the argument that Diego's presence could have interfered with Krasic. Krasic is essentially playing as a fantasista. What role would Diego have had in the team? Of course it could have gone the other way as well. It's possible that having both Diego and Krasic would have made us twice as deadly in attack. We'll never know though I guess. But consider that we also have Aquilani in the midfield as well now. Aquilani isn't a regista, he's a central midfielder who likes to push forward at times. Him and Diego might have been getting in each others way. And really, when you have a CM like Aquilani, a trequartista isn't entirely needed. You need strikers.

I personally would have preferred to keep Diego as I'm just too damn curious to know how he would have done. Seeing that we're doing fine without him, I won't begrudge Marotta for selling him. Tactically, I can see where he was coming from. I just wish we got more money for him. It's possible that the delay in his sale was a result of the constant negotiations with Wolfsburg to increase their offer, but seeing as how no other teams were interested, they reluctantly sold him off for the price they did.",Anthony ,"Oct 20, 2010 ", 2:40 PM,

"Podcast: Episode Seven- So Amauri, Marchisio, Giovinco & Cassano Walk Into A Bar…",The Offside Juventus,"Oct 19, 2010, 1:45pm PDT",,"Basically, Del Piero is both. He has the ability to create using his skills, but he also has the ability to score. Especially when he was younger, he was capable of playing as either a trequartista or a seconda punta. His better position has always been seconda punta though because of his goal scoring ability and smart runs.

I get what you're saying in that Cassano is more of a fantasista in the sense that he doesn't score as many goals. Cassano and Del Piero are two different players with different types of skills. Del Piero is a sort of combination between Cassano and Giuseppe Rossi in terms of style. Giuseppe Rossi is a scorer with skill like you're describing. Cassano is a fantasista because he creates something out of nothing with one touch of the ball. Del Piero, in his prime, was definitely better than both. He set up team mates with fantasia, and he scores great goals with great skills.

At the moment, Krasic appears to be filling that fantasista role in the team. That doesn't mean Del Piero isn't a fantasista as well though.

Between Cassano and Giuseppe Rossi as a replacement for Del Piero, I'm not sure who I'd want. Cassano definitely has more creative ability, but I think Rossi has more goal scoring ability because he's a more natural seconda punta. What does Juve need more? We were always spoiled with Del Piero because he possesses both creativity and goal scoring ability.",Anthony ,"Oct 20, 2010 ", 3:37 PM,

Some interviews right after yesterday's game:

Amauri talks about his last injury, the team's performance against le merde and the ubiquitous 'We played well and have to keep going like this'.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnP2ZtRsHtc&feature=player_embedded#!

Grygera actually surprised me. I think it's his terrible season last year and the fact that he never seemed to show any real emotion even after his errors that made me think he generally didn't give a fuck at all. I liked his responses and humble attitude, even when he was asked 'Your presence at Juve was in doubt before the start of the season and you were seen as a reserve, did that motivate you to have such a great beginning to the year?' he said 'I always had faith and just wanted to do everything possible to remain here at Juve.'

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Q0SldeSLY&feature=player_embedded#!

Aquilani appreciates GDN's faith in him, while joking about Melo's penalty saying 'I told him I had never seen a ground-flat cucchiaio'.

honestly, i dont want to sound like a stormcrow, but sooner or later, our goals are gonna dry up if our strikers dont start being clinical. Ideally, the midfield scoring goals should be seen as a nice add-on, and never the mainstay of our offensive capabilities.

"VotD: Grazie, Capitano",The Offside Juventus,"Oct 17, 2010, 6:12pm PDT",,"I think having Marchisio allows us to play in a 4-3-3 4-4-2 hybrid. Against Lecce we overwhelmed them immensely having Marchisio and Melo in midfield recovering everything. Playing against that type of pressure is overwhelming because you don't ever get to see the other end of the field, you are always playing in your own half and it is draining (specially when you are one goal down).

I think if we played Pepe or Martinez we would have won still the game, we might have even kept a clean sheet but we wouldn't have overwhelmed Lecce on the way we did. Storari had one shot to deal with which came from a cross from Krasic's side (where a more defensive fullback is located).

I also think that the team that played against Lecce is in Delneri's opinion the strongest team we can field and for that reason he wants to give them continuity. Aquilani has only played two full games with Melo and Marchisio (i think). Having the chance to play with each other for the match against Lecce or Bologna will allow them to learn to play together before we play Milan.

Also, the way we are set up we are essentially impenetrable on the left flank. Not even Maicon could do anything meaningful from there which means our defense can focus on the balls coming from the right which will certainly be the most threatening.

The width on the left is provided in parts by quags, PDC and Marchisio.
Krasic, on the other hand, plays as an out and out winger, so our RB dont bomb up as much as modern fullbacks tend to do, but rather advance only upto the centre of the pitch or slightly beyond.

I'm pretty sure that if Aquilani keeps his for like this MArchisio soon will be benched for sure. Yeah, i know many of you will be disagreed with me but believe me JUVE has much,much more quality and confidence with Aquilani in midfield instead of Marchisio!

1. Marchisio is disappearing from the games for a long time especially if we have strong midfielders around him.

2.He fights for the ball permanently and after 60 min he is fer from effective – it's good but did you notice Aquilani play against Inter? yes, marchisio did his defensive job against Maicon but Aquilani take some SMART clashes not lost one like MArchisio did sometimes.

3.Passes,passes,passes AKA Pirlo!!! No one can did this in our mid so guess ….

I'm not making comparission here but i must support GDN about his vision, simply we have 2 excellent players but we need to have some technical force which MArchisio is difficult to provide and like someone above sad MArchisio-Aquilani pair in midfield is needed i do believe it will not work ( check point 1)

As for Amauri He is the same crapy player as before – don't expect anything , better hope for Qualia to start providing more goals and improving his form. Iaquinta is gonna be starter in EL so he might take some rest together adp.

Although at current form Aquilani is playing better than Marchisio, remember that against inter Marchisio's tactical discipline kept maicon quiet the entire game. Marchisio is too good a player to be dropped-although in a 4-4-2 one of them has to be dropped.

If Juve do get Dzeko, then I think they can very well do a 4-2-3-1 with Krasic – Aquilani – Giovinco supporting him. Marchisio – Melo in midfield.



Right now, the best approach is to follow the same system as was followed against Inter. Marchisio adds very little offensively as a winger. But he can add defensive cover to the left side.

Juventus v. Lecce: All About The Quality,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 16, 2010, 4:44pm PDT",,Aquilani has pulled the strings very nicely today. I think his played great collecting the ball and moving it up the field. Amuari and Quags are starving for service. We need to do a better job connecting the middle of the field to our attackers. Krasic has provided this team with a constant threat and has continued to contribute greatly to this team. I think Marchisio has played a hell of a game – constant running and fighting for the ball. Has a nice chemistry with Aquman too – they play very confident together. Defense – mmmmm Lecce had one easy oppertunity where the defense was split but besides that pretty solid. Props to Del Neri for sorting the positioning out. We will see Pepe get some minutes – I would like to see Martinez get some good minutes in. Forza Juve !!!!!!!,Marcdush21 ,"Oct 17, 2010 ", 12:01 PM,
Juventus v. Lecce: All About The Quality,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 16, 2010, 4:44pm PDT",,"First half thoughts (I didn't see the first goal)

- It is amazing to see such a dominating team. This is a team that will strike fear on our opponents. I loved to see Quagliarella defend and De Ceglie put some crosses (albeit some mediocre ones).
- The commentator could not get over the penalty saying that it was soft. It was soft in the sense that Krasic had lost the ball. With that being said he was tripped in the area and it was a penalty by the book. Very simply, we would be just as upset toward Chiellini or Bonucci if they hit Olivera in the area after dispossessing him.
- The penalty was ballsy, shows Melo has remarkable confidence this year and props to Delneri. I hope Melo doesn't do that every penalty he takes, it was a little scary
- Marchisio on the wing has allowed De Ceglie to move forward a little more. If De Ceglie could put in some dangerous crosses then Marchisio on the wing will be effective
- Last, can anyone tell me if we are playing a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3 (with Marchio-Melo-Aquilani on midfield and Quags-Amauri-Krasic forward) or a hybrid of the two?",Jose ,"Oct 17, 2010 ", 12:01 PM,

Juventus v. Lecce: All About The Quality,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 16, 2010, 4:44pm PDT",,"Probably the best first half performance this season.



I love how Aquilani adds a whole new dimension to Juve attack. With him on the field there's much more movement through the centre. Juve attacks no longer go through flanks & Krasic only. In some of previous games I thought there was an over-dependence on Milos. We made the same mistake with Diego last season, then once he was marked Juve went limp.



It's unfair on Marchisio to be playerd as a winger, he too has played well as CM. But Aquilani has just too much quality to be ignored.Playing him as LM/LW gives more tactical discipline to De Ceglie's side, though he doesnt add as much as Pepe in attack, as a winger.

Juventus v. Lecce: All About The Quality,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 16, 2010, 4:44pm PDT",,"A couple more things after a full game
- No comment on defense, they weren't really tested at all. I am looking forward to Chiellini taking on the Merswedenary in a couple of weeks, I think that game will test our defense again.
- Del Piero is a goal machine, he plays for 5 minutes and scores a goal, proud to have him as Captain. I also think the management or Delneri made it clear to Del Piero that he will be a wonder sub. He seems to have understood that and that really helps the dressing room ambiance.
- One thing that this game really showed was team unity. All goals were celebrated together with players calling on the other teammates to come and celebrate with them (very clear in Quag's goal). Juve might not boast the individual quality that Milan or Inter have but I think we are a very good TEAM. I hope this team unity will get us out of tight situations in the same way that having individual quality does.
- Marchisio playing on the side is still puzzling to me. I was watching him carefully in the second half and I am still trying to decide whether he is essential to Melo and Aquilani playing together or just a measure to help PDC. Let me explain:

In some plays when the midfield is overwhelmed with players Marchisio helps Melo by either giving Melo options to pass or by closing down the channels the opposing player has to pass, ie forcing the player in posession to try to take on Melo one on one (very difficult given Melo's current form). He also helps Aquilani with a 1-2 allowing Alberto to get in a better place to direct play. Marchisio also plays close to Aquilani in case he looses possession. What I am trying to say is that in the second half of this game Melo and Aquilani looked good because of Marchisio's tactical awareness. Il principino is by far the smartest player on that midfield and I think that sometimes goes unnoticed. Credit also has to be given to Melo and Aquilani who also help Marchisio do his job properly.

After Aquilani was gone and Marchisio moved to CM he dictated play and broke play in the way we all know and love. He certainly shone more, but was his contribution just as essential for the team as it was at the beginning of the game?. I don't really have the answer.

- Bring on Salzburg. I know I shouldn't be thinking about Milan yet but my brother is a Milanista. If we loose, I have to live in the same house as him taking verbal abuse for the next 4 1/2 months until we play them again. More than anything I think if we win all of our matches until we play Milan we can give them a good run for their money.",Jose ,"Oct 17, 2010 ", 1:17 PM,

On another note; I think all this Dzeko talk is going to quell, I really think Cassano is coming here next year.

He is certainly a reference player and one that might help us improve in quality but I don't know if I would really like to chance it. Dzeko is younger and to me appears as a hard worker at least, more in tune with our team's philosophy right now.

With that being said I think Cassano will come for less money allowing us to make a better mercatto. Buying Cassano will mean we send Quags packing (certainly an upgrade) and we keep Alex for another year. Next year we are going to have to pay 16m for Aquilani, 7m for Pepe (if we choose to keep him) I don't see us renewing Motta's or Rinaudo's loan and Quags will be expensive (about 10m I think Aaron said in the podcast). That means if we keep Pepe and Aquilani we will spend over 20m from our transfer market.

Storari made a superb save in the early minutes and was composed all game. Chiello was at his usual best, no nonsense defending. Grygera put another solid performance. Bonucci was quite good overall but he lost his guy on a couple occasion. On the downside, PDC gave a nervous performance and was the weaklink of the defense. Good thing Marchisio and others bailed him out on several occasion.

Midfield: A+
A superb performance by Melo. Great at reading the game and as a result, great defending and help-defense. Surprisingly, his passes today were also spot on (Great job GDN!) Aquilani also put in a good performance. He gave a creative dimension to our attacks and mostly, he's efficient. I say we have found our regista. Marchisio, imo, was also superb today. He linked well with Aquilani to build the attacks and defended well on the left wing. But the ball of the match must go to Krasic. He's simply superb! 3 assists and he caused 3-4 yellows to Lecce. Could've sent 2-3 Lecce players off single-handedly.

Attack: B
Amauri put in a great effort and his through pass sent Krasic away to create the 3rd goal. But clearly he's not a scorer and we will need a much better prima punta when we play in the CL next season. Quags was missing from most of the game and while he put away the 3rd goal, he squandered a one-on-one brought on a plate by Aquilani with no defenders on sight.

my two cents -
The only formation i see this azzurri playing successfully is a diamond
Sirigu and Viviano, although both talented, really need a lot more time to mature-not only temperament wise, but also technically
I would prefer giuseppe rossi to cassano to juve
Molinaro was one of the biggest symbols of juve's post calciopoli mediocrity. Boy am i glad to have seen the back of him!

Podcast: Episode Six- What's Your Favorite Molinaro Goal?,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 15, 2010, 8:58am PDT",,"I was in Italy when Del Piero scored that goal. One of my favourites too. I was in a bar in Florence. Went on the trip with my school, so I couldn't go to the game. But the bar was great too. Juve are hated in Florence, so it was risky. But there were still a good number of Juve fans there. Nobody messed with us lol.

I also would prefer Giuseppe Rossi to Cassano at Juve. I think Rossi would just be a much better fit. It depends on the future of Giovinco as well. Whether or not he plays as a winger, seconda punta or trequartista.

Speaking of Giovinco, does anyone else think he would do so much better in Prandelli's 4-3-3 as a winger than Cassano, Rossi or Balotelli would? Giovinco is devastating on the wing. And in a 4-3-3 he'd be an out and out attacking winger and wouldn't need to defend much. It's a shame that he was injured…he might have been called up for the game against Northern Ireland.",Anthony ,"Oct 16, 2010 ", 12:34 AM,
Podcast: Episode Six- What's Your Favorite Molinaro Goal?,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 15, 2010, 8:58am PDT",,"Like was suggested in the podcast, I think if Prandelli wants to play a 4-3-3 to make up for the lack of wingers…then Giovinco needs to play as one of the wingers. And we would need a prima punta with good scoring ability.

While I agree that Boriello is pretty average, I think that in a 4-4-2 with a creative seconda punta close to him, he'd do much better. I think most Italian strikers do better in the 4-4-2. Every time Italy have left a lone striker too isolated up front, it's never worked out well. That's why the 4-4-2 or 4-3-1-2 work best. The 4-3-3 could work as long as the right types of wingers are played. Wingers like Giovinco. Cassano simply isn't affective on the wing in a 4-3-3….just like Del Piero was never spectacular in that position.",Anthony ,"Oct 16, 2010 ", 12:39 AM,

Podcast: Episode Six- What's Your Favorite Molinaro Goal?,The Offside Juventus,"Oct 15, 2010, 8:58am PDT",,"Regarding what you guys said about the lack of Italian wingers capable of playing a 4-4-2, I think the Azzurri could still play this formation. While technically there are better players than Stefano Mauri and Simone Pepe….I don't think people give enough credit to how playing them could help the team overall. Obviously more skilled wingers would be better…but Italy just don't have many. But playing those two in a 4-4-2 would mean that Cassano/Giuseppe Rossi get to play in their natural positions of seconda punta. It also means that the prima punta gets more service because there is a second punta nearby and the wingers will be delivering crosses in addition to the fullbacks.

Like you guys said, the 4-3-1-2 would probably allow us to play better more technically capable players though. Cassano would need to drop deeper into a trequartista position which is possible. But other than him, I don't see many other options other than Cossu. In fact, Cossu is a more natural trequartista than Cassano, so he may in fact do better in that position. Or Pirlo could be moved up to that position as well.

The 4-3-3 generally hasn't worked for Italy. Playing Cassano or Giuseppe Rossi on the wing moves them out of their ideal positions and makes them less effective. It also isolates the prima punta which has never worked out well for the Azzurri. Which is why I think the 4-4-2 would work better despite having to start both Pepe and Mauri (who's actually had a good start to the season). But, I do think the 4-3-3 could work if someone like Giovinco is played on the wing instead of Cassano. Giovinco thrives when playing on the wing. And playing that position in a 4-3-3 where there are less defensive duties than in a 4-4-2 seems like it would work even better. A player like that is what's needed to play the 4-3-3 properly.",Anthony ,"Oct 16, 2010 ", 1:24 AM,

If we are going to sell Momo, it HAS to be to a team outside of Serie A. Selling him to Inter or Napoli (teams rumored so far) would be an awful idea.

Balotelli, Rossi and Giovinco can batlle for the supporting position upfront, behind Pazzini of course :).

I think Blanc was partially kept on to manage the completion of the stadium. Blanc has been the one that handled that, and its smart to keep him there until its complete. I'm not sure whether they'll renew his contract in 2012, but if he continues to earn Juve money…then it's worth keeping him around.

Moggi once said though that Blanc was the first person that needed to be removed. He also said that Alessio Secco should go back to his old role rather than be sporting director. Regarding Blanc, perhaps he just meant that he needed to be removed from the president position…but I think Moggi said this before Blanc was appointed as president. I think as long as Blanc is surrounded by people that know calcio, he should be fine. But perhaps Moggi is onto something as well. Regarding Secco, Moggi knows that Secco was in over his head in the sporting director postion…but because of his background, he would have done a good job in his old position. I personally think that it got to the point where he just needed to be removed completely. His name will forever be synonymous with that terrible time in Juve's history.

When Moggi eventually does have his ban removed (and it will happen), do you think there will be a position for him at Juve? I remember him saying that he would never work with Blanc. So maybe he would take his position or something? With Andrea Agnelli there, I still there there's a strong chance Moggi will return to Juve.

Gotta disagree with that. In his time Ciro continually showed he was incompetent. A coach who only ever had a plan A- pass to Diego. The reason Zach did so badly is yes he didn't have a great squad, but the team moral was low and slowly getting lower.

As you can see that is shaping the new Juve Gigi Delneri?
""I must say that especially in the last game, the one against Inter, I saw a team that has purchased a 30-40% more than other games, this is a very important aspect. It 'clear that Juve has yet improving and still has room for improvement, but I think the road is the right one. I saw Juve 'old style' with power, with personality, went to face Inter Milan without fear. It seems there are grounds for review a Juve important. This is about the company, which I think has made important acquisitions, one in all, Krasic, then on the coach, he is doing so to give this team the right amalgam, which is a noble team, but for the various problems he had, went through difficult times. However, I feel that now is going well and I am very happy. “

We are pleased. You are still very close to Juve, you spent years with beautiful black and white jersey …
”How could I not be tied to a company like this? It allowed me to become a major player to win both. Then, unfortunately, my speech, a speech is a bit 'strange that I also struggle to deal with: I had to go away from Juve reluctantly, and then … never mind the controversy. There is always great respect. “

When you come to Florence as it was the environment?
”It 's clear that initially, coming from the historical enemy, they were very cool with me. But then, I earned their respect, they knew that person was. Before me Torricelli has also experienced the same thing. Who plays for five to six years in Juve, continues to hold in the desire to fight, the will to sacrifice, the desire to be professionals: thanks for this truly to Juve. “

Do you think Pepper can be your heir? Although you may have different characteristics …
”Let's say that he perhaps is more offensive to me, but in recent times have also changed the method of play, for example him to the outer tip Udine was very high, but I saw that it changes a lot here at Juve. I Like Pepe. Perhaps now is a bit 'in trouble, but has great scope for improvement, definitely. “

On the other hand is never easy to settle into Juventus …
”Even I, who was coming from the cadet championship, the first few times I wore the shirt of Juve … how much he weighed that shirt! It weighed so much. Need a bit 'of time before one is able to melt well.“

What do you think of the controversy at a distance between Ferrara and captain Alex Del Piero? Even if you are a friend of both, which side are you?
”I am very friendly with both and in fact I was left a bit 'surprised. I can tell you the truth: I was disappointed by both, because if there were to clarify certain things, if they had to say in the face. They told her off and I do not think they were correct. They ruined a relationship that lasted for 15-16 years. It could be avoided. And for heaven's sake, there are problems, we have them all …“.

But you have talked to Cyrus and Alex?
”Yes, I talked with both, but at some point I let go because I saw that the heads are both hard.“

What's missing in this Juve than where you've played? Although the situations are completely different …
”Yes, completely different. This is a very new Juve, from all points of view, also from the company. Marotta is one of those smart people in our area and in my opinion is doing a great job. As for the team, many purchases were made and should give her some 'time. Against Inter we have seen incredible improvements, in all respects. I am convinced, I am sure that this team in the long run, to say the her “.

These are much lower than external debate, which still can not get …
”I really really like De Ceglie. With the Inter Grygera I also enjoyed when he moved to the left. It 'clear that Delneri then wants two external low to attack all the time, but I must say that from this point of view you can always improve, going to buy another player. It seems to me that however the approach of the team is important. I also saw an incredibly compact: I liked it, after all this time, Felipe Melo, which I think is doing well. I loved also Aquilani, who is a player who can make a difference if he has physical problems. Krasic was one of the most important purchases made in Italy in recent years, because it is a fabulous outside and I think also a very humble guy “.

We're so convinced the Serb?
”To me, yes, very much. Apart from that I already knew him from before, but now that he will also learn the language will become stronger than the outside.""

What seems the most obvious problem with this is Juve the lack of “will point”, the classic center forward who is about thirty goals a season.
""Who's got if he keeps it tight. Everyone has a little 'problems from the point of the goal. We also saw last year with Inter Milan Milito, that every time he touched the ball went inside, this' years but can hardly take the door. And 'a particular moment, but I would give confidence to the tips Juventus. “

You play with a brevilineo and a bit of weight?
”Delneri always plays with a high and a brevilineo. It has always done. With the Inter played with Iaquinta and Quagliarella. Then play with Del Piero a bit 'lower and Amauri or vice versa.“

There is another school of thought: some people think that Amauri and Iaquinta together are devastating …
”Sure, why one goes down and the other goes in depth. It 's always been the game Delneri. Amauri-Iaquinta is a couple very important. I think Juve is potentially very well put forward.""",agiamba ,"Oct 14, 2010 ", 1:58 PM,

If De Ceglie keeps improving then we keep him, if not then we can try bringing Ziegler from Samp on the cheap. Cassani will probably cost around 15m, Aquilani will be 16m, Bale close to 17m and Dzeko 30m. This is a lot of money but it can be done in stages.",Jose ,"Oct 14, 2010 ", 6:12 PM,

One of the 'more reputable transfer insiders' on Vecchia Signora, who's usually fairly accurate with his information claims that according to his source, Neymar is Andrea Agnelli's personal dream and he wants to inaugurate the new stadium and new Juve era with Neymar at the helm.

According to him, we already have reached an agreement with the player and are working on getting Neymar a EU passport, which could be done since his grandparents are Portuguese. Supposedly, if everything goes well with the negotiations and we do qualify for C.L, Neymar's purchase rumors will emerge in the media around March/April. For transfer price, I've read 22 and 37 so I have no clue.

I'd rather have Dzeko because I mean honestly, if he somehow were to join us, is Neymar going to play besides Amauri?! WTF?

And about the US, somebody told me this so again it might be wrong, they had a similar date at the beginning of October at first but they changed it a few times (the reason this person gave me was to have a holiday in between christmas and halloween, but take that with a grain of salt).

Materazzi even comes down to the dressing room and is so pissed, he kicks a bottle and it accidentally hits a certain no.7 (uh, no no.7 @intermerda, so no.17 then… or no.27, your pick).

Furthermore, Eto'o keeps abandoning his left wing position to get more goals so Chivu takes himself out of the game without the coach's approval. And Benitez never let Milito play a full game, always 89minutes, and as a result, Milito's confidence keeps dropping.

Totti has been fined 10000 Euros by the FIGC for his frustrated declaration along the lines of “We have been robbed of 2 Scudetti by inter; not much has changed since Calciopoli just the colors of those who are doing the stealing.”

Moratti on the other hand, said this a few months ago: “è meglio essere una multinazionale che rubare”, “It's better being a multi-national club than steal”.

So a club would receive a certain amount of money for each day one of its players spends in the NT's training camp ahead of a friendly, qualifying match, WC etc. The more players a club provides, the more money it would receive and viceversa.

After an early calculation of the amounts Serie A clubs would be awarded for the 2010 year, Juventus is in first place with 0.897million Euros for the 299 days of services its players have provided this year so far.

inter on the other hand, is in dead last with earnings of 9000 Euros after just 3 total days of service provided…

-Dzeko going to inter now is about as probable as Torres going to Inter now. You really think that if he had the chance Rafa would push for ED9 instead of Torres?

They just renewed Milito's contract not too long ago, Eto'o is an indisputable starter and they have Pandev (who's injured I think?) but had a good impact for them last year about to come back.
On top of that, they have Biabiany and Coutinho, who although young, have been getting a decent amount of playtime so far.
Unless they get rid of Milito, they can't/won't pick up another forward. Although he's been playing like shit so far, Il Principe will hit his stride very soon, he's not Amauri.

-Dzeko's agent is merely throwing the inter name to keep the buzz around his client alive and plenty.

-Dzeko wants to move to a bigger club, how is he a mercenary lol? He never actually said that he's a Juve fan or that he wanted to specifically go to Juve. He wants to move to a bigger club and try to win silverware. Don't believe Tuttosport.

-Krasic has proven to be a great professional and a pleasant surprise so far but don't believe the media bullshit about him being a real Juve fan way before he signed with us. Krasic, like Dzeko is a professional who up until a few months ago was desperately looking to move up and he ultimately did fulfill this dream of his.
I love the fact that the man's got tons of heart, has embraced Juve so quickly, I hope he retires a Bianconero and wins everything possible with us but let's not kid ourselves, he would have fulfilled his dream even last year when Milan were after him, had that move been concluded.

Sometimes he tries too hard in the 1v1, he can go missing for periods of time in a game every once in a while and he can be a bit hot-headed. He's also much more attacking than Pepe and doesn't support the defense as much.

These are all age-related issues however and I'm sure with more consistent playtime Lanza will only improve. The potential is certainly there.

As for Pepe, he's far from an impressive winger but he has proved to be a very nice fit for GDN's system so far. I like his versatility and quiet, hard-working attitude.

Following copypasta from last post's comment section very relevant:

Does anyone know the guy who writes the inter blog?. I wanna punch him in face, not because they are inter but, he shouldn;t be allowed to write a blog. I think a blog is a method of journalism, it should be fair to any team, he was making sick jokes about other team, last time I read he was joking about Totti's body shape? they don't prove any sporting points in there. that blog is a neo-nazi hate crime portal. they are totally losing it. and I am pretty sure not even one of the 24 inter fans is reading their own blog.


Somewhere in the same section, you'll find one comment of mine where I generally blasted the referee. I did it for the lulz. Anthony (a fellow fan) pointed out immediately that he thought that the ref was fair and had a good game. Few people 'liked' the comment, but I'm sure it was simply because of the anti-Inter rant.

Compare that with the hate machine at Inter Milan where Mr. Retard will make a mental (maybe physical) compilation of all the 50-50 decisions that went against Inter Milan in last 30 years or so and begin his propaganda against every team. Roma won? They cheated. We drew? We cheated. There are so many inconsistencies and fallacies in his “arguments”, it's beyond ridiculous. Apparently, one treble is not enough to wash away years of inferiority complex.

Marchisio, is just a real professional, He is such a complete player that if worst come to worst just put this guy in as our DC! With Marchisio in the middle, we dont get too much creativity, but we get a hard working and complete midfielder!

"Daily Dose: Oct 04th, 2010",The Offside Juventus,"Oct 4, 2010, 8:36am PDT",,"I too love Marchisio. I had him playing on my teams in Fifa 08 when he was just a kid. PC games aside, he is a great professional and a great Juventino.

With that being said I think this team needs to have them both because they bring different things to the team and it will mostly depend on who we play and how we want to play. I am not saying they both have to play at the same time either.

If you noticed yesterday, Juve was playing a 4-3-3 with the ball, with Melo-Marchisio-Aquilani on the midfield and Krasic-Iaquinta-Quags as forwards. When we lost posession Quags went to occupy Maicon's flank which stopped him from running up the flank. And just in case Maicon dared to move forward he had to contend with Marchisio and De Ceglie (when he wasn't busy with Milito or Bibiany). So essentially we had a 4-4-2 with Quags playing pretty far to the left. This type of formation is very useful if we want to neutralize the wingers and not expose our fullbacks too much (we all know they are not exceptional yet).

However against Lecce playing a 4-4-2 with Marchisio-Melo-Aquilani-Krasic we will be shooting ourselves in the foot. We should bring the game to them and Melo and Marchisio should be able to keep possession well and pass quickly to the wings. I think yesterday Marchisio and Quags made Aquilani look good. If you changed Marchisio for Pepe and Quags for Del Piero (less physical and more inclined to play in the middle) and we would have gotten run over in the middle of the park.

I think both of them will be useful. When we are playing very strong teams I wouldn't be surprised to see Marchisio-Aquilani-Melo. Against Manchester City we played Martinez-Marchisio-Melo-Krasic, but you could tell that Martinez' orders were to defend more and attack less. Similarly to the Inter game, with that being said we all know Marchsiio is a better defender than Martinez will ever be. But all in all we were able to contain them.

Against weak teams expect Pepe-Marchisio-Melo-Krasic, or Martinez-Marchisio-Melo-Krasic, or even Marchisio-Melo-Sissoko (in a 4-3-3 with Martinez playing as a wide attacker).

But then, what do I know, I am just a fan and want to see Marchisio develop into the star we all know he can be.",Jose ,"Oct 5, 2010 ", 3:23 AM,

It basically said Dzeko (30mill) = Diego (20mill) + Momo (10mill). With the Wolves already paid 10mill for Diego, we need to give back the 10mill they paid us + Momo for Dzeko.

It did sound conspicuous back then when we sold Diego for only 15mill so I guess goal.com followed it up with another theory especially since the Wolves were interested in Momo. I agree with Paul. I'll believe it when Dzeko shakes Andrea's and Beppe's hands and flashes the no.11 shirt (cough… amauri… cough).


EDIT – We'll know more in January won't we? If Momo does go to the Wolves, it will certainly be more believable.",dwicarta ,"Oct 5, 2010 ", 11:07 AM,

Storari
Grygera-Bonucci-Chiellini-De Ceglie
Krasic-Aquilani-F.Melo-Marchisio
Iaquinta-Quagliarella

Amauri in the stands, as he's not fit yet.

2 questions:

1) Why TF is Marchisio starting as a LW? I understand that Aqui is supposedly in good form together with Melo and GDN wants to start them again but even if this move was made with Marchisio covering for De Ceglie's casual idiocies on the left, I think Pepe could have done a better job at it. The latter runs for 2.
2) Amauri in the stands as he's unfit. Is Alex going to be the only real forward on the bench? Don't think Giannetti got called up since he played 90 mins (and scored 2 in 2 minutes!) for the Primavera yesterday, which leaves us with Lanciafiamme and Martinez as other options.

- De Ceglie was good, very good, if he keeps that form for the rest of the season we just need to find him a good sub
- Grygera played a good game, he seems to be cementing his place in the starting lineup
- Motta played well, but at the rate we are going he is going to be sent back to Udine at the end of the season
- Chiellini and Bonucci are making things work and I saw Storari more involved organizing his defense
- We played as a team, not a bunch of individuals. I liked how Krasic was helping defend
- Quagliarella did nothing and I don't know why ADP didn't replace Quags instead of Iaquinta
- Melo was not at his best this game but the midfield worked great. Having Marchisio help De Ceglie in defense went a long way to shut down Maicon, kudos to Delneri.
- We don't have the quality or depth to win the scudetto but we are certainly starting to look like a strong team where good things can come from. This far into the season last year we started to see our team get torn apart. This year we are seeing our team come together. If you would have told me that we were going to get two draws against Manchester City and Inter and concede only one goal after conceding two in Cagliari I would have said no way.
-Last, De Ceglie really impressed me that is why I am writing about him again, I have trashed him in this blog for a while now but he certainly is coming around.

Love the midfield. Melo and Marchisio covered the defense while Aquilani and Krasic were unleashed. Brilliant!! Not fond of the attacking unit, though. ADP was good but others…. not so much.

You could definitely tell the (very positive) difference between this Juve playing at the San Siro and the one playing there last year but let's take it one match at a time.

I'll admit that none of our players played like idiots but there were still a few moments when I was yelling at my laptop complaining about Melo's excessive need to pass the ball, about PDC's diagonals and interventions being sloppy, Bonucci's often timid displays on counters etc etc.

This match has also left me in good spirits and like I previously mentioned this was a very good week. Again, this Juve displays better tactical discipline and character than the one last year, by FAR. In our last Serie A San Siro game against inter we were slaughtered in terms of play and we looked ridiculously scared and disorganized, in the Trofeo Tim idem.

I think his finishing just let him down, because he's the type of striker that misses the sitters but scores the wondergoals. His finishing let him down, but besides that he was a menace to the Inter defense and besides a few passes that were too heavy for Iaquinta, was generally very solid. Our entire team played well. Honestly i think the worst was Iaquinta, who was dangerous for the first 30 minutes, but then faded out of the game fast. Marchisio was played out of position to nullify Maicon, and did his job quietly but effectively, i wasnt happy about that decision by Gigi though because Marchisio's attacking potential is too big to waste like that. We shouldve started with Marchisio in the center, allowing him to attack, and Aquilani on the left wing instead, able to still play his beautiful long balls and whatnot and help out De Ceglie covering Maicon as well, but to put Marchisio on the left and tell him “dont attack, just watch Maicon”, that i dont like.

I'm looking at Enzo D'Orsi's La storia della Juventus (The History of Juventus), and our 9-1 win over Inter under shady circumstances (the original match was cancelled, and a win given to Inter, but then it was decided, thanks to Agnelli influence, to have a re-match, where Inter protested and played with their primavera team against our mighty, already scudetto winner-lineup, including the great Omar Sivori, who scored 6 in this match).

So, not all our wins have been glorious, but as I read this, I kept thinking, ""if they wanted to protest the match, they could have simply refused to play and suffered the consequences; after all, Juve was already the champion, Inter had nothing to gain or lose. This is historically typical Inter behavior, i.e. to appear principled and noble, but in fact when push comes to shove, chicken out at the end (hence the primavera team playing) and take the easy path.

Also just wanted to say, there's no team in the world in any sport I hate more than Inter. And I don't hold many of their fans in high regard. As for this weekend, slagging Inter is one thing, but try and keep the personal insults out of it regarding the people on the Offside, no matter how much I agree that some of them are asshats.

A lot of one touch passing to avoid too many battles over the ball, and double teaming on defense.

I was impressed with PDC. He held the ball well while being pressured by sometimes to players forcing them to foul him. His confidence is growing. Did we not say that all he needed was more playing time?



I was also very impressed with Iaquinta pulling his defensive weight, pressuring Man City's backs and mids, not allowing them to just send the ball up field all day long.

Banega is much better but it would be interesting to see how he'd do in a more physical, more defensive league such as Serie A, since he's got a relatively small stature too.

Hernanes was another top notch CM who (thanks to FM in part too) I have followed ever since ~07-08 when he won the best Brazilian championship player award. Too bad Lazio got him.

my thoughts, not on the game, but as an all round performance from the beginning of the season until now, i cannot but be completely satisfied with what i am seeing. Not only is the Juve spirit back, but the players are showing how dissatisfied and pissed-off they are when they draw a game like we did with Fiorentina.

but let's remember, that our aim should still be the champions league spot. Yes, i admit, had the circumstances been right, we would have been able to compete for the scudetto, but we must also admit, that even though we have dramatically changed for the better, we still have some work to go through in order to become a complete all-round squad by reinforcing some very obvious areas.

we have had a rough month playing Roma, Genoa and Fiorentina and granted, by the way be played, we should have gotten all 9 points, but the bigger picture here is that we have remained unbeaten, the squad has remained compact, and more importantly, teams are starting to respect and fear this new Juve.

i have faith in this new management and hopefully, come next season in the new stadium, we will be battling for all honors.

1.Huntelaar – i don't like this idea at all. This guy has proved his inability to plaay in Italy. He is more inconsistent than many other, so he is fine in germany and let leave hi there, MAROTTA!

2.Matri – This one is someone i like a lot. The guy is young, strong physicaly and score decent ammount of goals. Italian BTW. he can solve our problems seriously upfront and apart of all this donadoni words HE IS STAYING i do believe we can take him in january but not cheap. 15 mln IMO. Good option for us!

3.LECH game – i know you will think i'm crazy, but i want us out of this competition. We are not ready yet to be consistent in the league what left for us to be in another tournament by the same time. thi can cause us some difficulties in midseason. We don't have a players ready to do it. Major mistake from GDN to leave Brazzo and Grosso out of the group(doesn't matter their denials).We need them more than before. In general, the team will have time to prepare more than enough and take a better results.All players are available so let be focus in Seria A.Next year will be ready IMO. Having in mind the weather which expect us there we can make the things worse after this game with more injuries.

4.Barca – real – i watch Benzema there carefully but i do believe we don't need him at all.why do we cry some much about him i don't know (he can be decent option available in january bu…). Mediocre and slow – we need speed upfront as Barca showed real yesterday, so we need mobile bomber upfront nor the heaviest prima punta nowadays :)

5. Grygera – he is coming from injury which is good new but let keep him healthy to be starter in the league not EL. we do have more problems in this positions so let be smart in Poland.

In general, January is knocking on the door but i think we must be very carefull in transfers. As somebody (ROBE) wrote somewhere missing good finisher is make us worse than having poor fullbacks. I agree if we score a lot often we will skip difficulties on the back and compete for CL spot easily. so. MAROTTA be smart and make some magic and take young and classy bomber.

Sure thing bro.

It's a well-known fact that there have been racist chants against Seedorf from the Juve curvas EVERY TIME Juve-Milan have played the last 5+ years. Gaby Mudingayi and Stefano Okaka have also had to endure racist chants when facing us. The reason why Khouma Babacar went out early on Saturday was not due to picking up a knock no, it was due to the constant racist chants by the Juve fans. Momo Sissoko's transfer to Juventus from Liverpool was seriously in question when Momo learned from former Juventus midfielder Stephen Appiah that although playing for a club like Juve was a great experience, having to face thousands of racist screams on a weekly basis from your own fans made it impossible to think of Juventus as a long-term destination. The reason why Felipe Melo was heavily booed by his own fans last season had nothing to do with his poor performances that did his considerable transfer fee no justice, it was actually due to him not being of pure Aryan descent.

It is obvious that when rival Serie A fans have chanted 'Se Saltelli Muore Lucarelli' at Cristiano Lucarelli, it has been of racist intentions.

PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"I watched most of the game (didn't watch after Pepe's goal) and I think the glass is half full, here is why:

- Our fighting spirit is back. Last year we would have lost this game for sure, this year we fought back and got a draw. In a game complicated like this a draw is not a bad result.

- Our team is young. All of us want the scudetto, but we are not there yet. Actually, under Ranieri every time a player or staff talked about scudetto we will loose the next 2 games and draw the next three until no one talked about the scudetto anymore and then we will start winning again. Same thing this year. Fly under the radar should be our plan

Going back to the age thing, for this being the youngest squad in Serie A we are not bad at all. Next May Inter and Milan will be one year older while Juve will have one extra year of experience. That is the difference between a team with a mean age of 26 vs. a mean age of 31.

- Our team seems comfortable with the changes the coach made. We were the strongest team on the field tonight, and by a large margin

- We played to win. Under Ranieri there is no way that we finish a game with Iaquinta, Quagliarella, Krasic, Pepe, Lanzaframe. That is all we have short of Delneri grabbing a black and white shirt and jumping on the field. Under Ferrara and Zac we would have been 1-0 after 10 minutes of the game and then we would have lost 4-1

- Other teams are starting to fear Juventus. The fact that Fiorentina came to play a game to neutralize Juventus and not their own type of football is very telling of how we are perceived in the peninsula. Krasic was double marked and Aquilani was man marked. This means that Fiorentina were scared. If we had Trez they would have been even more scared and I think we would have won the game handily.

With that being said there are a few things that need to be looked after

- Motta can't start. I am not saying this because of the own goal. Players make mistakes all the time and sometimes those mistakes result in own goals. He can't start because he is not good enough and he is not doing anything to show otherwise. Also, I believe that a coach must start conservative (ie. Sorensen). I am not saying that had Sorensen been playing instead of Motta we wouldn't have been 1-0 at half time. The issue is when we are down Delneri could bring a more aggressive winger (ie. Motta) which would have caused issues in a defense that was double marking Krasic on the right. Pepe or Sorensen should be our starting right backs, Motta can play when we are loosing and we need offensive support.

- We need a prima punta and hopefully a world class seconda punta. This begs the question again: To Cassano or not to Cassano?

- Krasic will be double marked by teams that are trying to get a result in Torino. He better get used to it.

- Aquilani will be man marked by teams that are trying to get a result in Torino. He better get used to it.

- Delneri needs to find a tactical solution to the Aquilani man marking. In my books Aquilani should have played further back drawing his marker out of position.

All in all this was not a horrible game. Fiorentina defended with everything they had and Juve tried to the best of our abilities. Boruc had the game of a lifetime and Storari was unlucky (I guess so was Boruc). Chiellini and Bonucci are looking good together and even Grosso was doing some descent stuff here and there. Marchisio really helped the team and Melo was… well, Meloesque sometimes.

Anyway, that is what I thought of this game. Lots of improvement needs to be made but there are lots of good things as well. Forza Juve",Jose ,"Nov 28, 2010 ", 4:39 AM,

We are dominant every step of the way but we do not manage to bang in the goals when we have clear-cut opportunities. That pointer of Iaquinta… omg… I would've been ashamed to miss from that range.

Since I do not count on Amauri and am slighlty starting to give up on Iaquinta who is starting to show the Quaglia-syndrome of being unable to score simply, I'm hoping we get ourselves something new in the winter mercato.

PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"After a game which we suffer a lot and missed our chances some things are coming from my mind:

1.ADP picture above – He was visibly upset by the sub but BRAVO to GDN to replace him on time. He must accept that hes a player for 50-60 min max. WEll done by the coach having in mind LECH game on thursday.ADP is starter so …not too much to be upset.

2.The result – I think we deserve to win after the chances in second half, but realistically the draw is fair result. Viola came for draw and took it. the stone is in our garden. IMO we took a important point insead of loosing 3

3. The play – as somebody mentioned above Krasic and Aquaman was marked nicely today and was visibly we suffered a lot in offensive plan. here is the point – since all the teams already know our advantages they will give us trouble in the future, simply like viola last night. They just close the 2 imrotant offensive treats in our midfield and they are almost done. A lot more game like this are expecting us till the race is finished so GDN must find solution in this case otherwise we will fail significantly in further stage.we need options in games like this and we don't have it yet.

4.Spirit – our guys are back!!! That's the juve we need to see and support, doesn't matter we are goal down. Huge credit for the team and coacjing staff! Don't forget we are average 26 years old team. BRAVO!

5.Right back – i know is long time discovered problem but thing which bother me a lot is GDN consistency. He knows Motta is not good enough but he keeps going on him. Apart of this believe i think he is wrong and now is the time to fix the thing. Grygera will be starter for sure but we need believe in Pepe or Brazo as a cover (especially second one). once Pepe is sub he can be better right back – IN ANY CASE EVERYBODY ELSE IS BETTER THAN MOTTA NOW. new buy is a must in january on the right side.

6.Second weak link – LEFT MIDFIELDER. Since Nedved retired we don't have it at all. Marchisio is one of my favourite players but he can't drift the flank as a winger and because of this our attacks are predictable as last night (Krasic of course). Having in mind that Grosso is not pushing forward on the wing we loose one point in our offensive department. I know, You will tell Martinez is injured, but even He is not natural left winger. We need competition there to boost left side offense.

In general, i think we don't have to be negative, we took a point, showed a good character and spirit which will be fundamental part of the team in the future.

As Robarto or somebody else mentioned above:

I keep reading about Motta and how he played in this game. Forwards miss sitters, defenders make deflections and own goals. I do not blame Motta at all for his performance yesterday. He did not have the best game but he didnt have a terrible one either if you factor in the skill of Vargas ( i would take him any single day of the week to play for Juventus) Vargas has MAD skill as evident last season against us when he scored and this past game. Plus, add in Krasic not always getting behind the ball put plenty of pressure on Motta. I understand Bonucci and Aqua were yelling at him. The time that aqua was yelling was for Motta to win a 50 50 ball but i rightfully saw him pull back because if he had the would have exposed huge opening on the left. All in perspective. One last thing – who ever things the young Dane who is so flat footed and inexperienced could have taken on Vargas, his skill, and experience is not soccer savy. Sorrenson is good with plenty of upside. Someone who is that tall and nimble will break there ankles going against the skill of Vargas. I heard Del Neri yelling at Krasic who was trying desperately to be involved in the game. At times i saw him push into the trequartista role. So fans, please dont be like espn – take a quote and run with it – or take a performance and critic it. Just chill – these kids are young and are trying to learn. Grygera should take the starting spot soon, Pepe showed that he can adapt – so since we are thin due to injury – lets get behind this guy. It is the fans who should get excited that we are giving the youth an opportunity to shine.Its not going to be perfect for at least a few more seasons. Plus his on loan – we need to see if he does fit into our long term plans. I just think everyone takes one games and trends it into the future likes math – this is soccer. I think Firenzes goal was a fluke – our right side was really beaten up on – but again thats Krasic/Aqua/Melo/ Motta/ Bonuccis faults. Please be fans – not fools. i beg you to understand when you play skills players that run at defenses – you cant possibly think someone with little experience and flat foots could possibly do better. Us Juve fans most not be so fast to cast a stone. We are better than that. Forza Juventus. (ps. this coming from someone who isnt the biggest motta fan, but i see that he means well out there.

PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"Marc, I see what you are saying about Motta and Vargas, but I think in defense the coach should start with the most defensive option. I am not saying that with Sorensen on the field we wouldn't have allowed a goal but at that point Delneri could have brought in Motta or Pepe to give us an offensive edge. The moment we are 1 goal down with Motta on the field the option of bringing Sorensen is off the table because Sorensen is not going to give the attacking support to Krasic.

I also think the other thing people in this blog have been commenting is how he wasn't trying hard enough on the field. There were a couple situations in which he didn't get back on time and left Bonucci and Chiellini by themselves.

I think also with the proper instruction Sorensen could have taken on Vargas, at least better than Motta did. Motta hardly stopped any crosses, it was our CBs who headed them out. Sorensen has better positioning and is overall a much stronger defender than Motta is.

Last thing, Motta's own goal is not why I am calling for him to start on the bench it is because of his overall performances until now. Molinaro also tried very hard, just as hard as the old guard some days but he just wasn't up to Juve level. With that being said, I don't see Motta trying as hard as Molinaro ever did and we were all calling for his head after 1 year on the team.

PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"I respectfully disagree about Motta and his performance.

It's not as much a matter of him playing embarrassingly bad yesterday, it's a matter of him being 24 years old and the definition of mediocrity. He was very promising when he was 18-20 and it seems as if the last few years he has regressed in footballing ability. How the fuck do you manage to do that when it is your profession and you haven't even been badly injured, I have no clue.
It's not like Motta's disappointing displays began when he signed with us anyways, just read what the Roma fans have been saying about him for the last couple of seasons. He has a bit of a reputation of a self-imploding time-bomb, every once in a while, he'll lose his concentration completely and put his team in a difficult position.

I understand that Vargas is talented, difficult and all that and trying to defend against him in a 1v1 is very hard (I played RB in hs and I remember having to go against some talented opponents that made me look like a complete tool for the entire game lol). What I can't comprehend is how a 24 year old professional can be so atrocious at 2 headers in about 10 minutes. He couldn't header the ball properly during the own goal, he was about as far from it as it gets during the Gilardino head-butt. What, was Motta just closing his eyes and jumping up in hopes of hitting something?

Do you remember that episode when Motta had the ball probably about 25-30 yards away from Storari's goal and he was just jogging with it forward, without paying any attention to the Fiore players behind him making their way back? If it wouldn't have been for the stadium that 'alerted' him, Gilardino(Vargas maybe, not sure) would have won it from him and put the team under a ton of pressure.

Lastly, when we signed Motta, the general consensus was that he was young, still had to improve on his defensive side but he made up for the latter with his great contribution forward. What has Motta contributed going forward this season? He's got a couple of assists, one against an Irish side we were heavy favorites against which would probably struggle to stay in Serie A were they to play in it and one in complete garbage time in that Juve-Palermo for Iaquinta to make it 1-3 from 0-3. Anything else?

-I did however read that Motta had been having some back problems prior to yesterday's match. If this is true, then I blame GDN for making him play 80 minutes when he should have been a substitute at the most. Where was Sali yesterday?",jorid22 ,"Nov 28, 2010 ", 2:52 PM,
PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"I was thinking more about your point 3). Krasic was double marked by their left back and their left CB. This happens because we had one of Quagliarella or Del Piero playing back so the left CB can focus on Krasic.

I was reading a Zonal Marking article about how Brazil played under Dunga. There Brazil and Gilberto Silva played very far back so their marker couldn't follow them that far into the pitch without leaving a huge hole in the middle of the park. I was hoping Delneri will pull back Aquilani a few feet back when Fiorentina were still trying to attack and see if that gave us a bit more room. That could be a solution

The other solution to our creative problems is PDC. He is a lot more dangerous than Grosso and his crosses are just perfect. I think he also compliments Marchisio on the wing better.

Third solution. Play Pepe at right back, he will provide better support to Krasic on the right and will allow Krasic to attack the center of defense instead of the flank, this will confuse the opposition.

Last solution. Leave the Melo-Aquilani-Marchisio midfield and place Lanzaframe or Pepe. Delneri tried that but at that point we were a tactical mess trying to just get in the ball.",Jose ,"Nov 28, 2010 ", 2:34 PM,

PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"Jorid said it well, but I'd like to add a few things.

- I haven't seen Motta when he was 18-20 yo, but after 14 games this season I can tell that the player is mediocre at best now (mainly in defense). His positioning is off, his tackling is not well timed, and a lot of times he appears to be lost and confused.

- Although no one can predict what would have Sorensen did, but drawing from the two games he played at right back so far, I'm sure we wouldn't be giving that space to Vargas. True he is inexperienced, but the guy has an amazing sense of positioning and his physical presence and timely tackles helps a lot. For me, I'm sure among others, his presence would have given a better sense of security.

- Jose also has a good point of starting with Sorensen to have a better defensive cover and if needed add Motta later on for a more attacking formation.

- The own goal has nothing to do with the assessment of Motta.

- If the guy is giving his best and what we saw this far is his best, then I don't think he is Juve quality.",MC00 ,"Nov 28, 2010 ", 3:22 PM,
PotD: Not Pleased.,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 27, 2010, 4:08pm PST",,"I agree with you Jorid. I also think that Krasic should have been closer to Vargas on the goal. If you watch the replay, its Krasic who should have tracked back to stop Vargas. He was standing around with his head in the clouds.

Del Piero was somewhat selfish in this game yesterday. He wanted to score so bad that it jeopardized the overall performance. I liked his mentality, but I think he was consumed by the idea of scoring. I think he could have passed the ball on a few occassions. An example was when he passed the ball to Melo, ran out on the left, and then shot over the crossbar…..he should have , hit the ball out to Quagliarella or Krasic.",Gaetano ,"Nov 28, 2010 ", 3:16 PM,

If you are givn this two choices:

2) Take a gamble and spend money in january (which was not expected) to try to win the scudetto this year, money that we could use more wisely next summer.

- Take out ADP because he was playing selfish, he was too slow for the Fiorentina defense and not strong enough. Something had to change up front and our only option was Iaquinta, not too much into that.

- Take out Aquilani because he was being man marked and dominated. Putting Marchisio, a player that moves a lot more would make his marker struggle a little more + confuse the marker now that he has to cover a totally different type player. Bring in a real winger to switch wings with Krasic to confuse the opposing defense. Give Krasic all the freedom in the world to play left, right and center, as he did with not great results.

- Take out Motta, play Pepe at right back to help Krasic. Keep an attacking winger on the side (even though Lanzaframe was playing quite centrally).

The point is that Fiorentina defended very well and had a great keeper who was on top of all this lucky. The own goal in the first 4 minutes really conditioned us and we need to start finding responses to this type of situations because I find it baffling that a team had 60% posession for about 90 minutes of the match and couldn't do anything but score a lucky goal. That means that out of the whole game we had the ball for 54 minutes and we needed a goal keeper blunder to save face.

I am all good with playing Pepe at RB if Krasic is being double teamed. Once we get PDC and Martinez back we will be that much more effective going forward. Next year we get a bomber and we have to have a promising seconda punta. Maybe Pasquato will start playing seconda punta a little bit for us next year.

Roma didn't have one half-decent chance against us, while Fiorentina scored out of a non-existing chance… On the other end we had a multiple of shots on target and clear cut chances which should've been buried easily… The lach of a goal scorer is hurting us more than playing 2 mediocre fullbacks imo. Simply because Chiellini and Bonucci are cleaning up their mess almost entirely but no one is banging in the goals our prima punta should even though we have the top scoring side.

I think with a striker à la Pazzini we would've scored even more goals and would be top of the league right now. Possibly with for instance Caceres we would've been there as well, but I'm not so sure about that.

I know it will NOT be possible to solve this in the winter mercato, but I do believe that when De Ceglie and an in-form Grygera return (or Sorensen starts playing regularly) we'd be better off buying a striker compared to some fullbacks… But realistically speaking we should get a right-back for sure.",Robee ,"Nov 29, 2010 ", 8:47 AM,

Buffon would like to return prior to Christmas, but knows he still needs time to train and improve.

”I think I will be back in January, but whether it is at the start or end, I am uncertain. It will depend on my condition, as it takes time.



“I will remain at Juve. I think the kind words by [sporting director Giuseppe] Marotta show how highly he regards me.



”I am also certain that we have the ability to play to win the Scudetto. It is an objective of the club, coach and the players want to reach,"" he concluded.",Somnath_Sengupta ,"Nov 29, 2010 ", 11:17 PM,

1) The biggest problem in the team right now is Motta, without a doubt. Defensively he gives me stomach pains as he watches the opponent instead of tackling. Offensively, he does not support Krasic the way he needs to be supported. What good is he? Aquilani's outburst at him a few minutes before the end of the first half tells the story.

2) The midfield is not doing too bad, but in attack we're leaving great spaces for Fiorentina to counter, and they should have scored in the 3 to 2 counterattack.

3) ADP and Quagliarella are not too bad, either; unlucky for the most part.

4) If Aquilani manages to get into this game a bit more, and Motta is replaced, we should be fine. Let's hope Lady Luck shines on us a bit, as well.",juvealways ,"Nov 27, 2010 ", 5:40 PM,

the other thing is MArchisio – he plays good as usual but not productive enough on the left to trouble. All the game goes on the right side (in our part of the field).

B) We need to take a key decision this winter – is our goal the scudetto or just CL qualification. Everyone here knows that I have been strongly vocal against even using the S_____ word – but looking around the general performance of the other teams, and our frankly astounding progress since the start of the season, smart but expensive reinforcements in the transfer window might start us on the path to some silverware.

Marotta spoke today regarding whether he would sign Dzeko or Benzema. He says Dzeko over Benzema without thinking twice.

I think the deal with Wolfsburg for Diego is not as simple as it appears. I am still hopeful that we have an option to sign Dzeko next year for 30m, however may be there is a clause that if Wolfsburg wants to sell Dzeko they can but then need to pay us an extra 5 or 10 m for Diego to make things even. Who knows, I am just speculating, I just think Dzeko has stayed to long in the media to be a simple rumor.

Marotta also says that Maxi Lopez is not an option. Here is the article in Italian if you are interested.

And i believe if we chase him and offer him a contract he WILL come to us. THe lure of Del Neri and Marotta will be too great. Remeber the Sampdoria game, remember how Cassano kept playing with Del Neri on the side line. They do have a very good relationshp, and if we are to go forward as a club, he would be an IMMENSE signing.

On the tactical front, Cassano is the perfect fit, if we keep playing Marchisio on the left as a wide midfielder. Cassano's natural game when playing upfront is to cut in from the left. He offers creativity from everywhere as he plays with a free role, but mainly when he is cutting in from the left is when he does his damage. He will make up for the lost creativity of not playing a nautral winger on the left, and it is another reason to get him if he goes on a free.

http://ponderingcalcio.net/http:/ponderingcalcio.net/a-game-to-forget-that-wont-be-forgotten",Lars Aabjerg ,"Nov 26, 2010 ", 8:01 AM,
"Gobble Gobble, Happy Thanksgiving",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 25, 2010, 8:12am PST",,"Sitting 4th in the league, on the back of a lengthy unbeaten run, praiseworthy performances and results against some decent sides, a gem of a defender unearthed from the darkness, King Chiellini signing a new contract whilst still bandaged from his war wounds…all of which achieved despite a savage injury crisis…Indeed, this season is bringing me so much happiness. With the only blemish on our fortunes and progress seen in the europa league. Regrettable, but hardly enough to dilute my welcome reinvigoration of expectation and more importantly, pride, in the club i hold so dear to my heart.

Injuries to so many players from the first team squad threatened to derail our attempts to gain a sense of rhythm. But the spirit, which was so sorely lacking last term, which had appeared in flashes in the early erratic stages of this season, has thankfully steadied itself and blossomed. Translating to whoever has come in to plug the gaps, doing their bit to continue our strides towards becoming, once again, a top team domestically. Its the injuries to De Ceglie and Martinez which bother me the most. As the young left back, who for so long had shown brief glimpses of potential, had finally started to show some defensive solidity and consistency, before his knee got crunched. Also with Martinez…whose Juve dream so far has been a nightmare, in terms of physical condition.

Still…there is presently, and I stress the word presently, a silver lining, from the clouds of injury misery, and his name is Sorensen. I am almost scared to speak too highly of the lad, so will try to keep my feet on the ground here, rooted in realism, not fantasy…but…the danish kid has grown in stature with every appearance, and to me, he has shown, in the admittedly small amount of playing time afforded him, that he has a large dose of natural defensive talent. Strong in the tackle, decent positioning, decent timing, uncompromising in one on ones, and only lacking apparent eagerness to forage forward to support his right wing comrade. This kid, on what I have seen so far, has very serious potential, which CANNOT be allowed to suffer from a Loan, or Co-ownership. In our time of need, we asked a completely inexperienced player, still learning his trade, even at youth level, to step into the breach, and I doubt anyone can contest that he has performed admirably.

The midfield is where we look the most settled. What began as a measure to counter the Maicon threat has gradually become commonplace and dependable. Whilst Marchisio is playing loosely out of position, he is clearly not asked to play as a traditional left winger. For when Krasic bombs forward, and as the statistics prove, he is most often our most advanced player on the field, Marchisio tucks more into a central/left midfield position, as the formation becomes more like a 4-3-3 than a lopsided 4-4-2. Yes this does make us more predictable, but predictable or not, who can contain Krasic???? Add to this fluid movement, the fine form of Melo and Aquilani and its clear why we are now able to control, and often dominate the midfield area. Its the central duo in particular I am most pleased with, as with Alberto dropping deeper than ever before in his career, and truly excelling as a regista, Melo can do what he does best, which is to muscle and slice through opposition attacks through the middle, and spray the ball to krasic, back to Alberto, or to Quags and DP. More options to pass to, and less pressure on him to create…This Melo is phenomenal, and whilst I am obviously biased, I do not see many teams with such a strong pairing in the middle of the park.

Praise must also go to Storari, who has been in exceptional form all season. Often having nothing to do for long periods of a game, when called up he comes up with the goods. And it is this concentration which is the sign of a great keeper. A VERY shrewd signing, which must presently be seen as a success, the same can be said of Krasic and Aquilani, and to a lesser but still commendable degree, Bonucci, who is making less errors and slowly developing a decent understanding with King Giorgio.

Impossible to judge Martinez and Traore, as they have barely played.

13 games played in the league. Sitting 4th spot. Scoring goals, brilliant spirit in the ranks, and after our earlier erratic form calmed down, and the defence became solid, we are fast becoming one of the meanest backlines as well as most vibrantly potent in front of goal. I have to be content with this.

We can do with reinforcements in the January transfer window, mainly a striker and fullbacks, perhaps also a left winger if Lanzafame is dead or unwanted. I am unsure if we will sign a striker and Marotta reconfirmed today that Dzeko is wanted. If that is the case, then surely we will only sign a striker on loan, not outright. This is too long to explore potential purchases, but I have blossoming faith in Marotta to continue the good work already begun…

Many reasons to be cheerful…",thegutterpoet ,"Nov 26, 2010 ", 9:58 AM,

He has played more games this season than both of them (Aquilani doesn't play in EL and Melo was injured for a period) and has done excellent. I have said this before and I will say it again, those three make our midfield solid. When we miss Aquilani we miss his calmness with the ball and his long range passes. When we miss Melo we miss his strength and his defensive abilities. We haven't played a game without Marchisio from the onset (I don't think) but if he wasn't there I think we will miss his sacrifice. Marchisio pops up way at the back helping De Ceglie, Grosso, then he is helping Melo defend and gives Aquilani a way out when he gets into trouble. He also shows up far in attack. Look at the goal against Genoa and the other goal he scored at the beginning of the season (he was at the edge of the box).

Marchisio is the most sacrificed of our midfielders and really helps our team. Aquilani and Melo are great but their job is always more out there for all to see. Marchisio's job is quieter but just as essential.",Jose ,"Nov 26, 2010 ", 4:10 PM,

He is also a reason why Krasic can push up so much. With Krasic cutting in it often becomes a 4-3-3. Marchisio's ability to play as CM comes in handy then, he can cover a lot of ground when the midfield becomes narrower. Without Krasic, however, he is a bit of a weakness for the team. With a conventional winger like say Pepe, the 4-4-2 shape is retained, in this case the other winger has to offer width also, which Marchisio still doesnt do, he does tend to drift in towards the centre all the time.",Somnath_Sengupta ,"Nov 26, 2010 ", 11:39 PM,

If we play cassano behind quags, it is still the same thing as we do with ADP.
So tactically I don't see we can fit him (unless of course in the wing…meaning Marchisio or Aqua on the bench).
What we need is a penalty box striker for now. and that is what we should get. just because he is free that doesn't mean we can use him effectively.

-Paratici on Tuesday was watching Basel-CFR Cluj live with Xherdan Shaqiri the intended target.
-Paratici on Wednesday was watching Schalke-Lyon live with quite a few players being the intended targets: The Hunter, Jefferson Farfan, Rakitic(whose contract expires in June) and Bastos. The latter believed to be the main reason why Paratici was in Gelsenkirchen.
-Juve is following Salvatore Bocchetti and if Rubin Kazan won't qualify for the group stages of the C.L by the end of the Russian league, a move could be made for him in January.

The only realistic (Even though I'd like to see both at Juve, I don't think a move for KJH or Bastos would be possible or worth it from a financial standpoint) names that I like out of those are Shaqiri and Rakitic who would come on a free.
Farfan is meh and Bocchetti has gone from being promising to a Motta like player. Relatively young defender who's a gigantic question mark/liability and that we absolutely do not need since we got Sorensen, Rinaudo coming back, Camilleri etc.

Mario Gomez is playing great after a disappointing season last year, he's got 17 goals in 22 games already.

If he keeps this up, Bayern doesn't even need Dzeko.

Bayern needs a top notch GK whose last name does not associate with cheese and a new defense that is not made up of geriatrics like Van Buyten or mediocre players like DeMichelis and Pranjic.

What would you rather have if we don't get Dzeko then?

I do have to say for following this blog for over a year now that the fans are just a little delusional. I am a big Hamsik fan. He was on the same plane back from South African for the world cup as me. He was a great guy, i approached him and told him that i was a die hard Juventus fan and that we would love for him to play for us. He laughed and told me that he loves the fans in Napoli – and he loved Serie A. He also mentioned that he has always been a big fan of Juve. My point is this – if we give Amauri and Sissoko plus cash for this guy then Napoli gets a lot stronger and that is a strong team already. That is just bad business and we should NEVER make our opponents stronger. We should go after Granero tha plays at Real Madrid. This is a young register (great back up for Aqua) who is getting neglected in the Real Madrid squad. We should have a change to pick him up. I suspect who will have a over priced assessment but well worth it. Secondly, Dzeko should be our primary attacking option, but if he demanding such wages – then its time to find another fit. THERE ARE MANY MANY fits – i would much rather keep a young team, and add grinta, and more spirit than overpaid over hyped pre Madonnas (i am not saying Dzeko is)",Marc ,"Nov 25, 2010 ", 1:01 PM,

Materazzi has always played tough, dumb and dirty and outside the pitch he gets tattoos of the Jules Rimes cup on his leg and continues to talk about who was the first one to mention mothers and sisters in the '06 incident with Zizou.",jorid22 ,"Nov 23, 2010 ", 9:39 PM,

"Juventus News Odds & Ends: November 23rd, 2010",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 23, 2010, 12:06pm PST",,"A few thoughts:

Ade
Aaron has said anything to be said. Ade doesn't worth additional comments.

St. Buffon
I want him at the all new Gianni Agnelli Stadium but football is a funny business and with his high salary, don't count anything out come summer.

Chiello's Renewal
It feels good that it is finally behind us so we can start taking care of the next: il principe. I like him. His skills, his attitude, his sacrifice for the team. I believe he is and will be very important to us now and in the future. Along with Chiello, he will be one of the 50 Juve legends part II.

Emerson as scout
Historically and statistically, brazilians didn't do too good at Juve. So while it's nice to know, I have this to say to Emerson: “Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.”

Prima Punta
This Jan, I believe it's more logical to bring a serieA striker in. If we want an immediate impact player, who are better than the ones that already in serieA? So I'd say Maxi Lopez or Matri.

The Summer.
Personally I want a world class RB the most, and a world class prima punta. LW? I prefer giving Martinez more chance. After that:

Backup for Aquilani
It scared me to hell when he played for the NT last midweek. One time, and he had a muscle fatigue. Given that he's gonna play more next season, another regista is a must.

Backup for Melo
I just don't trust a manchild.",dwicarta ,"Nov 24, 2010 ", 12:06 AM,

"Juventus News Odds & Ends: November 23rd, 2010",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 23, 2010, 12:06pm PST",,"On the loans, I'd take:

1. Aquilani – Class. Offensively, a player we can't live without.
2. Quags – Consistent. If he keeps this up, of course. We've already paid like 5m for him anyway.
3. Pepe – Versatile. If he keeps improving, decent backup at both wings.
4. Sorensen – the future. Will be a defensive pillar in the near future.
5. Motta – Cheap. And young. Banking on him to get better and serve as a RB backup.

The other two, Traore and Rinaudo, will be going back to their respective clubs. We don't have an option on Traore and we can cope well without Rinaudo so far.

A Not-so-Live Liveblog: Genoa 0-2 Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 21, 2010, 10:19pm PST",,"It is hard to explain what being a fan is to Interastri. I had to sit down and write this, maybe a few of them will understand:

“Being a fan is not about success, a common misconception among fans of teams like Inter.

”Choosing a team"" (whatever that means; as far as I'm concerned, the team chooses you) is not like going to the shopping mall, and buying a cell phone because it had a good plan, or some tomatoes at the grocery store because they looked good that day.

Being a fan is not about who won what, and how many times.

Being a fan is not about who's the darling of the day.

Being a fan IS about identity, culture, spirit, and tradition. Every team (well almost every team) has one.

If juve went to Serie C and stayed there for the next 10 years, I would still be a juve fan, although I'd probably die of a broken heart (and I mean this; my other, let's say, “local” team from the city of my birth, Altay -also white-black shirts, incidentally-, has been in the 2nd and 3rd leagues for most of the last quarter century. A shame after its truly glorious past, but I do not feel less of an Altay fan for their lack of success).

And that, my friend, is the difference between Inter fans, and practically everyone else.""",juvealways ,"Nov 22, 2010 ", 3:50 AM,

A Not-so-Live Liveblog: Genoa 0-2 Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 21, 2010, 10:19pm PST",,"All is not as it seems…

Tonight was very cold. It didn't seem possible that this night was darker than any other previous nights, but it was darker. The stars were missing from the sky and even the moon was reluctant to show her face.

A chilly night like tonight was when everybody stayed at home. However, a hooded shadow wearing a long coat emerged behind a tree and walked straight to the bridge. The hood covered half of the upper face but you could see the person wore a goatee and had chubby pinky cheeks. If one had spent time in China, one could confuse him with a panda. For some reason, he seemed uneasy and fidgety.

On the other end of the bridge, another shadow emerged. He was walking slowly but between the two it was clear that this person was the one who held the cards. He wore spectacles and had eyes so bright you would think one of the eyes could breath fire.

One eye: Why the f*ck did you call me in the middle of the night and ask for an audience?
Panda: Well, what do you think? They are crucifying me over there! I can't take it anymore! Sobs

One eye: Jeez… are you crying? You know before we stroke a bargain it wouldn't be easy. And why did you have to do it so extreme? We didn't ask you to pummel them this low this soon. You are moving too fast.
Panda: (a bit angry) Do you think I want that!? They are so arrogant after winning the treble and my boss didn't wanna spend shit so I basically inherited senior citizens all over the field!! Treble-winning senior citizens!! Do you know how hard it is to tell them to do anything!?

One eye: Yeah couldn't blame you there. Hell, 10 of the starting XI are 29 or over so no wonder the injuries keeps piling up.
Panda: Tell me about it! I even actually have to really coach them. If I did what your boss told me to do, they'd already be in the relegation zone.
One eye: Shit! Why did you have to say that…? sigh….

Suddenly, a cold voice was heard cutting through the night, “So you're saying I'm a fool, rafa?”

The night was cold but the voice was even colder. Suddenly, another figure was walking towards them. He was medium-built but the way he walked oozed power. Even from the distance both of the men felt pressure.

Rafa, the panda figure, was shocked and he whispered to one-eye, “Holy crap! Why did you bring him here? I'm peeing in my pants!”
One-eye: Rafa, he's my boss. He tells me what to do, not the other way around. Now just shut up and listen to him!
Rafa: (whispering) Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck…..

The boss: So are you, rafa? Calling me a fool? (smiling… coldly)
Rafa: (apologizing tone) I didn't mean it that way An…..
One-eye: Hey!!! Watch it! No names here!!!
Rafa: Uh, sorry guys… but I'm really in deep water here.

The boss: Just remember rafa. I don't care what you do but let me remind you what I want: Keep your job, keep them playing in the CL, at least until the quarters, and make them go no higher than 5th in serieA. Do you understand?
Rafa: Yes. But uh… another thing. The way things kept coming out from farsopoli, don't you think it is better just to leave them alone? The noose keeps tightening and tightening on my boss….. I started to pity him.
One-eye: Yeah, karma is a bitch.

The boss: Don't you dare pity him, rafa. You work for me, don't you forget that! That son of the b*tch waited for my dad and my uncle to pass away… bless their souls… before he pushed this whole farsopoli thing. Even if the noose keeps tightening, in the end I want him to know that I am the one who will take the last pull.
Rafa: Okay, I get it. I'm sorry. I'll try my hardest not to disappoint you.

The boss: Good boy. Ciao rafa, and don't call in the middle of the night anymore.
One-eye: Ciao rafa.
Rafa: Bye guys.

Rafa waited for five minutes, and he also left. As soon as he was off the bridge, the sky opened. He thought, “Well, when it pours, it pours.”",dwicarta ,"Nov 22, 2010 ", 4:17 AM,

A Not-so-Live Liveblog: Genoa 0-2 Juventus,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 21, 2010, 10:19pm PST",,"1. i'm in complete agreement with adam digby about storari probably being our most influential signing. marco has been awesome and while he might not have the 'superhero' aura around him,he's been instrumental to our keeping clean sheets and getting great results ( off the top of my head, i can recall great saves against milan, roma and inter!) while i'm not quite sure i wanna jump on the 'sell super gigi now that we've got super marco' bandwagon , i'm certain marco has made a great impression and the 4.5m outlay on him is money well spent.

2. ex-selecao coach dunga said after the world cup that juve had'nt seen the real melo last season n that if he melo was truly happy and felt loved in turin we'd see a totally diffrent player… 3 months down the line , looking at the absolute monster melo has become for us, i think we should forget about paul the octopus and form a bee-line to dunga's door! felipe is clearly happier these days…perhaps it was the affirmation he got from delneri at the start of the season…whatever it is, it's clearly worked….he plays with a smile (no more middle fingers and STFU to the fans!) talks poistively and maturedly in the press about juve and he's even got a mohawk these days! i guess he's one of those whose form is intricately linked with their emotional state n having identified that fact, i fink the powers-that-be in turin should figure out how to keep-up the good thing we have now

3. i know it's still early days yet, but i already consider agnelli,paratici,marotta & delneri legends…they have identified the key elements of our legendary DNA and have gone about reviving it with minimum fuss… when diego was sold we were all up in arms…ditto when rafa was about to leave liverpool and we the board did'nt seem keen on bagging him… a couple months down the line and boy am i pleases with what we got!
diego was a good player BUT krasic was a better fit for the team we needed to build, ditto for rafa (despite the shenanigans going on at inter, i still rate the dude) who's also a good manager but not as good a fit for juve as delneri ….

So, here is the team, picked with the stipulation that it contained at least one player from each of the six republics.

Give him a tall, aerial striker and now we are talkin. I'm not sure if he could play up and down the left wing for us though, as he doesn't do much defending. Him & krasic on the wings puts alot of pressure on our fullbacks. Which are pretty damn young and thin right now as is.

Melo helps defend and sometimes slots in as a CB almost. Marchisio helps defend PDC and Grosso's flank. Quagliarella slots in at LM. All these tactical changes are in order to get the best out of everyone, and if we bring a winger then I don't think Delneri will throw everything out to suit Dzsudzsak (man that is hard to spell).

"Genoa v. Juventus: ""Battle Royal""",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 20, 2010, 2:15pm PST",,"After waking up at 4:30 in the morning M.S.T. I got to see the Old Lady take 3 points home, my thoughts:

- Defense: The CBs looked good, Motta and Grosso not too good, specially Motta. Most of the Genoa attacks in the first 60 minutes came from Motta's flank and I don't think it was the fact that Krasic is prone to attack leaving Criscito unmarked, I just think Motta can't defend for the life of his. (More on Sorensen later).

- Midfield: The starting midfield was great. Marchisio-Melo-Aquilani-Krasic. They understand each other well. Even though Marchisio is not a natural winger and doesn't provide what Krasic does he still brings peace and time to this side. When Marchisio gets the ball I breath a sigh of relief because I know we are not likely to loose the ball. Aquilani is such an elegant a solid passer. He makes this side fun to watch. Melo was solid as well but showed some of his bad side a couple of times. Krasic was… well at first he seemed nervous, when they jeered him he was loosing concentration and it was overall bad. After a while he became solid and destroyed Criscito for the second goal and a couple times more. If we had Trez we would have won 4-0. This game was won by our midfield, not just because the way they kept possession and distributed the ball but our 2 “wingers” got the best of the Genoa defense.

We are a very different looking team with Krasic. Without him we can tackle all game long but we can't score very easily. With him it seems like we get attacking options at will. I hope we had a replacement for him because otherwise we have a very hard time unlocking teams (only Milan since Milos got banned and injured).

- Attack: Iaquinta and Quagliarella partnered up well. They held the ball well. Too bad they couldn't score (specially Iaquinta) in a couple good chances he had.

- Delneri and his subs: I was hoping Sorensen will play ahead of Motta when we started the game but I figured an attacking full back might get us on track, so Motta ahead of Sorensen was good. When we were up 1-0 and Criscito kept showing Motta how it is done I was really hoping Delneri will bring in Sorensen… nothing. At 2-0 it seemed evident that if we wanted to win we needed Sorensen covering the right flank because Motta was not contributing anything in defense or offense at the time. Sorensen came on and we looked so solid on the right flank. Bonucci and Sorensen alternated the RB and CB position very well and seemed to have a great understanding. I really like how Sorensen plays, he is calm, collected, physical (at only 18) and read the game well. To make things better, he had two very nice passes towards the end. If Delneri teaches Sorensen to cross we have a solid fullback/center back for years to come. Defensively, he seems more solid that Bonucci does at times.

Then Sissoko came in for Krasic and I was like… no way. Delneri invited Genoa to attack and Sissoko lost as many balls as he won. Delneri must not rate Lanzaframe to high if he brought in Krasic for 60+ minutes and then substituted him with Sissoko. I wouldn't be surprised if Lanzaframe is out on loan in January.

Last was the Brazzo switch. I don't know if Brazzo was playing as a winger in a 4-4-2 with Marchisio-Melo-Sissoko-Brazzo or the defense became a 5-3-1 with Chiellini-Bonucci-Sorensen in CB flanked by Grosso and Brazzo behind Marchisio-Melo-Sissoko. One way or another the message was clear. We were going to stop at 2-0.

I didn't like the changes except for Sorensen. Bringing in Lanzaframe for Krasic would have helped us defend by keeping the ball at their end. And a midfield of Melo and Sissoko should not happen unless everyone in the team is injured. With this being said, it shows that Delneri has confidence in our defense (specially in young Sorensen).

- One last thought on Criscito. I always had a soft spot for him. Today he was marked by Motta and Sorensen. Motta is 24 (one year older than Criscito) and Sorensen 18. Criscito is a better fullback than both of them. He can attack and defend better than Motta and he is certainly more solid passer and crosser than Sorensen at the time. I am sure a thought along the lines “I wish Marotta, Paratici and Delneri were in Juve when I was there”. I feel bad for the kid, the talent is there and I would rather have him fight with Paolo De Ceglie for the LB position. Best of luck Mimo (except for when you play the Old Lady).

fantastic game..you can tell that they used that typical italian tactic -get a healthy lead, then defend it. and by God did we defend. the back four looked great, there were one or two shaky moments but other than that, AMAZING :)
Melo, undoubtedly played one of his best matches, along with Aquilani.

I'm so happy that we managed to control the game from the very beggining to the end.

This is my favourite team!

So, all the aspect was good today, apart from 2-3 small things which we all know need improvement:

1. Attack – today we must score at least 4-5 goals. i love Iaquinta so much but he is simply not the finisher who we need for the new Juve. Today he missed 2-3 golden chances which may cause us defeat some other games.He was selfish in one on one situation! We definetily need to buy a striker in January.

2.Fullbacks – Motta is absolute disaster. I hope at pre-season that he will give us secure service, but God Damn, i saw him scare today early in the game to attack the opponent and waited for Bonnuci to attack first and he second just waited for the second person…NO WAY!Sorenser is the answer till Grygera is back. Grosso on the other side put decent display today, thanks again to MARCHISIO, but if it's work, FINE. Till PDC is recovering he have to play starter, at least in games like this. We need to buy another left back to be competition for PDC.

3.Sorensen – man, this kid made me proud today. He made several high-class positionig against opponent and 2 excellent long range passes-nice vision! this kid will improve and i do believe GDN bravely use him cause he knew it. 2 things are missing for him right now – crosses and speed. Apart of this he is perfect addition to defence – he contribute to Bonnuci nicely, which didn't left unoticed.

4.Midfield – our midfield is looking game after game better and better. WE HAD WORLD CLASS MIDFIELD TODAY IMO! marchisio is looking more secure in this position, Aquaman is our maestro, Krasic is constant treat and Melo is beast as we wanted to be. Almost perfect today.

In general, we started to grow visibly. If we keep this form constantly till the winter break i'm pretty sure we'll finish at least second. GDN must give a break for a while for AQUAMAN cause without him we will suffer. He became fundamental for our play. Today he requested sub cause he felt tired IMO, but let's keep him out of injuries( you know him,fingers crossed).

Good work for GDN. HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO AND PLAYERS LEARN FROM HIS CONFIDENCE!

"Genoa v. Juventus: ""Battle Royal""",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 20, 2010, 2:15pm PST",,"Any thought guys?

Juventus move forward with three points but a selection headache for Luigi Del Neri. Given Aquilani’s growing effectiveness in midfield and the need for support from a pure ball-winner in Melo, Claudio Marchisio’s contribution – due to Del Neri’s inflexibility – is forced on to the left of midfield. Although he arguably is better than Jorge Martinez and Simone Pepe for that role, he does not offer a genuine threat to opposition right-backs, wasting both the player and the position and placing attacking momentum well and truly at Krasic’s feet.

Also, although I'm not a fan of using Marchisio out of his natural position, as somebody mentioned earlier on here(whoever you are, come forth and redeem your prize lol), I now feel a sense of security if the play is switched to the left to Marchisio's feet. I know he's not as attacking as Krasic or Martinez but the fact that he's such a well-rounded player allows us to keep possession and build up play fairly easily and often, while also covering pretty well for whoever slots in at LB until PDC comes back. Not many balls have been wasted when they have gone Claudio's way the last half a dozen games or so.

I believe the fact that he's naturally a CM and is used to playing right in the middle of the pitch has helped Claudio serve as a good balance and link between all 3 sections of the pitch.

"Genoa v. Juventus: ""Battle Royal""",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 20, 2010, 2:15pm PST",,"Ratings:

Storari- 7. Positioning, bravery, anticipation, smart reflexes…he truly is one of the finest keepers I have seen in Serie A, for a long time. Almost a shame he will be relegated to the bench come late January, but a shame for him, and joy for us…As Santo Buffon will have returned to the battlefield. Until then, Storari has my full confidence. Little to do for large periods of a game, then he is alert when needs be. the sign of a top drawer keeper.



Motta- 5.5. Whether its a mental, physical or talent issue, I am unsure, but he simply hasnt found his feet in these last few months, and has done nothing to suggest we should sign him outright. Looks lost at times, and overshadowed by his 18 year old replacement in the second half.



Bonucci- 6.5. Solid and dependable…Other than perhaps one incident when he let a ball go past him with a man running in behind him, who made a desperate lunge for the ball…how close the lunge was, i couldnt tell…maybe leonardo judged it perfectly. I just prefer to see defenders, if in doubt, give it a clout…



Chiellini- 8. We are so fucking lucky to have him. Still fairly young and already, week in/week out one of the strongest centrebacks in the world. So hard to beat, to outmuscle, to outjump, and even if you do find half a yard, he attacks with more often than not perfect timing…superb, absolutely superb. I love the guy.



Grosso- 6. Credit must be given for sticking to the task, after so long out, unwanted, exiled from the squad. An unspectacular, but still proffesional performance.



Aquilani.6.5. Seemed somewhat subdued, or maybe just busier in his defensive duites than in previous games. Still used the ball intelligently, covered lots of ground, showed good stamina and spirit.



big Phil Melo 7. Regaining his stride after the injury absence. Dominated possession in midfield, passed well, tackled like a beast, lovely to see him smile, and that new haircut is perfect…for a nutcase.



Marchisio- 7. He made his own luck with the goal, other than which, he rarely got passed on the flank, had one other opportunity to square the ball for two waiting players in the middle, but chose wrongly to shoot across goal. Good stamina. Solid, perhaps showing more comfort in this new left wing position.



Krasic. 8. Scored a great goal, set up a couple of decent chances for our strikers. Direct running, often beating two men at once…and he is only just returning from a lengtht break due to injury. A fine showing, from our star player.



Quag.6.5. Worked very hard, but wasnt helped by Iaquinta's brainless movement and poor touch. His runs are better seen and found by DP. But then again, quag has been playing in a more advanced role when with DP, with VinnyCenzo, he had to move further down the field…so a change of sorts…accompanied by a change of fortune. To be fair, his shooting was a little bit tame. Still, far from an awful effort.



VinnyCenzo. 5. Easily marked, one decent effort on goal which flashed past the far post. Lacking match fitness and sharpness? could be that, or simply that his form is always rather topsy turvy. with only his effort never been in question.



SUBS



Sorensen. 8. This kid can tackle. His timing is amazing for someone so young. Exactly the opposite applies what i have been saying about de ceglie, pre DelNeri, as in 'he has zero natural defensive talent', this kid oozes natural talent. His passing seems to be becoming already BETTER than Motta, and i give him praise for attempting a few first time cross field balls, fucking up one, hitting another perfectly, and playing the ball short and simple for the rest of the time. Surely, by now, Delneri ca nsee who is the better right back? The 18 year old is besating Motta hands down in every area. The mark may seem high, and is, but he is 18…3 games into his professional career in the top flight of Italy. Takes some mental steel and skill to prove as dependable as he has done so far.



Sali Goblin- N/a



Momo- Shocking on the ball as always, but did make at least one beautiful crunching tackle.



Del Neri.7.5. I dont like it, but understand why he went defensive after the break. His subs made sense. Brave to play krasic from the start. Spirit in the team seems strong and proud and expectant of victory. So far, he is likely making a few juventini eat their ignorant words of criticism from earlier on in the year…He seems to have recreated that familial atmosphere and togetherness in the squad, as well as the belief in competing for the top positions.



Overall…a wicked result. Strong first half performance. Brilliant to see Krasic return, with aplomb…also Melo back to form…Chiellini an absolute monster. I would have preferred to see us using attack as the best form of defence in the second half, rather than inviting them onto us to have a go…which they did. Still, their two best efforts were against the bar, one from range, and one hit first time in the box. Other than that…they didnt really trouble us. We troubled them more, as we should, as we have better players.



So…a slight moan, that we didnt go for the jugular. But 0-2 away, to a team coming off two victories on the trot, clean shit, krasic back, melo and giorgio in regal form…im a happy man.",thegutterpoet ,"Nov 21, 2010 ", 8:28 PM,

"Genoa v. Juventus: ""Battle Royal""",The Offside Juventus,"Nov 20, 2010, 2:15pm PST",,"Tonight was very cold. It didn't seem possible that this night was darker than any other previous nights, but it was darker. The stars were missing from the sky and even the moon was reluctant to show her face.

A chilly night like tonight was when everybody stays at home. However, a hooded shadow wearing a long coat emerged behind a tree and walk straight to the bridge. The hood covered half of the upper face but the person wore a goatee and had chubby pinky cheeks. If one had spent time in China, one could confuse him with a panda. For some reason, he seemed uneasy and fidgety.

On the other end of the bridge, another shadow emerged. He was walking slowly but between the two it as clear that this person was the one who held the cards. He wore spectacles and had eyes so bright you would think one of the eyes could breathed fire.

One eye: Why the f*ck did you call me in the middle of the night and ask for an audience?
Panda: Well, what do you think? They are crucifying me over there! I can't take it anymore! Sobs

One eye: Jeez… are you crying? You know before we stroke a bargain it wouldn't be easy. And why did you have to do it so extreme? We didn't ask you to pummel them this low this soon. You are moving too fast.
Panda: (a bit angry) Do you think I want that!? They are so arrogant after winning the treble and my boss didn't wanna spend shit so I basically inherited senior citizens all over the field!! Treble-winning senior citizens!! Do you know how hard it is to tell them to do anything!?

One eye: Yeah couldn't blame you there. Hell, 10 of the starting XI are 29 or over so no wonder the injuries keeps piling up.
Panda: Tell me about it! I even actually have to really coach them. If I did what your boss told me to do, they are already in the relegation zone.
One eye: Shit! Why did you have to say that…? sigh….

Suddenly, a cold voice was heard cutting through the night, “So you're saying I'm a fool, rafa?”

The night was cold but the voice was even colder. Suddenly, another figure was walking towards them. He was medium-built but the way he walked oozed power. Even from the distance both of the men felt pressure.

Rafa, the panda figure, was shocked and he whispered to one-eye, “Holy crap! Why did you bring him here? I'm peeing in my pants!”
One-eye: Rafa, he's my boss. He tells me what to do, not the other way around. Now just shut up and listen to him!
Rafa: (whispering) Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck…..

The boss: So are you, rafa? Calling me a fool? (smiling… coldly)
Rafa: (apologizing tone) I didn't mean it that way An…..
One-eye: Hey!!! Watch it! No names here!!!
Rafa: Uh, sorry guys… but I'm really in deep water here.

The boss: Just remember rafa. I don't care what you do but let me remind you what I want: Keep your job, keep them playing in the CL, at least until the quarters, and make them go no higher than 5th in serieA. Do you understand?
Rafa: Yes. But uh… another thing. The way things kept coming out from farsopoli, don't you think it is better just to let them alone? The noose keeps tightening and tightening on my boss….. I started to pity him.
One-eye: Yeah, karma is a bitch.

The boss: Don't you dare pity him, rafa. You work for me, don't you forget that! That son of the b*tch waited for my dad and my uncle to pass away… bless their souls… before he pushed this whole farsopoli thing. Even if the noose keeps tightening, in the end I want him to know that I am the one who will take the last pull.
Rafa: Okay, I get it. I'm sorry. I'll try my hardest not to disappoint you.

The boss: Good boy. Ciao rafa, and don't call in the middle of the night anymore.
One-eye: Ciao rafa.
Rafa: Bye guys.

Rafa waited for five minutes, and he also left. As soon as he was off the bridge, the sky opened. He thought, “Well, when it pours, it pours.”",dwicarta ,"Nov 22, 2010 ", 3:28 AM,

Aqua thanks the previous caller for complementing him and comparing him to Paulo Sousa and then a new caller comes on. He's Simone from Vinovo.

An Interview with Pavel Nedved,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 19, 2010, 2:59pm PST",,"Nedved is a legend. Absolutely love him. Seems like it was a combination of him feeling he couldn't give his best anymore, as well as not being part of the club's project anymore that led to him retiring. There should be a spot for someone like Nedved in every club in the world though, regardless of age. He brings more than just his actual ability to the table. So even not at 100%, he would have made a big difference last year I think.



The club obviously need to invest in younger players for the future as well, but coming off the bench or starting less often, he would have been a terrific influence on the team. So many times last year the players just gave up. With Nedved there, that wouldn't have happened I don't think.",Anthony ,"Nov 20, 2010 ", 2:30 AM,

My names Mike and i'm from Los Angeles. I am of American/Russian descent, first generation American. I'm a content developer/marketing assistant and am 25 years old.

I've been a fan for most of my life, but really started following the team passionately about 8 years ago. My parents both spent some time living in Italy before they moved to the states so that's how I inherited my love for the greatest team in Italy. I also lived in Siena for about a year when I was studying in college. Best experience of my life! Siena is such a great town!

My favorite players of all time have to be (in order) La Furia Ceca, ADP, and Baggio/Buffon (tie). I'd have to say that my favorite player at this moment is either ADP or Krasic (who is winning over my heart every time he touches the ball). Favorite former player has to be Nedved (still brings tears to my eyes each time I see him in the stands).

Favorite Juve moments include, anytime we beat inter (marchisio's goal anyone?), and beating Real twice. these are recent Least favorite Juve moments include anytime Inter wins any games/stolen scudetti/morattti's face (so frightening..i might be him next halloween)

I play primarily as either a left or right attacking winger.

#4- Pirlo, Buffon, Chiellini. Pirlo. Too new to watching football to have a good take on all-time great, but I must say I love a good defender and everything I've seen of Beckenbauer is stellar.

#5 Current- Chiellini, Former-Nedved, Least-Tiago

#6-Fav- Nedved send-off game/ceremony. Least – Bayern game last year. All-time: Italy-Germany game 2006, grosso + ADP goals.

#7- Fav Music = Neil Young, Sonic Youth, Magik Markers, etc. Movies – Everything by Herzog/Bergman/Jarmusch and good documentaries. Hobbies – Film, Mushroom hunting, Bicycling, Beer brewing.

#8- I play when I can in various leagues (intramurals, city) and pick-up. Prefer to play right or left back, but can also play central defender even though I'm not a big guy. Also play ultimate frisbee and follow Arizona Wildcads in college basketball and Phoenix Suns in NBA.

#2- Im a student, havent decided a major


#3- I was a WC06 convert, im of italian descent so naturally i followed the azzurri along with usa. i fell in love with buffon camoranesi and del piero, so becoming a fan of juve was pretty easy! its true when they say the team picks you.


#4- Del Piero, and then a tie between trezeguet and buffon. Onyewu, he played for Clemson where i grew up. Not to be cliche but Pele.


#5- Del Piero! Trezeguet or Nedved, wasnt around for any of the older legends. Ibrahimovic, he doubles as my most hated athlete in general.


#6- Beating Inter last year even amidst our worst season; Marchisios goal then is one of my favorites of all time. Calciopoli. Winning WC06.


#7- Beatles, Floyd, Zeppelin, MGMT, Cold War Kids, Spoon, many more. Monty Python and the Holy Grail and others like that. FM prolly counts as a hobby, and im also a writer.


#8- Yes, I prefer a center attacking midfield, fantasista type role but usually get stuck at wing or striker. Short track is pretty cool, i cant do it though. I support clemson in everything even if i dont follow them much, UCONN basketball is beast as well.

#2- I'm a student studying Banking and Finance and Accounting, 21 years old

#3- Interesting story. When I was very little I went over to Italy and while I was there I spotted a t-shirt with the image of Del Piero on it. I then got my dad to ask the shop owner who said 'WHAT! YOU DON'T KNOW DEL PIERO! HE IS THE GREATEST PLAYER IN ITALY!' I then looked up everything there was to know about Del Piero and became a die hard supporter from then, with my whole family converting over too.

#4- My 3 favorite Juve players of all time are Del Piero, Baggio, Zidane. Favorite to never play for Juve (being a defender myself I modelled myself on) Nesta. Best player of all time would have to be Del Piero

#5- My Favorite current Juve player is obviously Del Piero but being a central defender I love Chiellini! Fav former Juventus player would have to be Baggio, can't stop watching his videos. Least favorite Juventino at the moment has to be Amauri, the guy has to go!

#6- Juve-Real Madrid Semi Final has to be my favorite while the whole calciopoli is my worst.

#7- Fav music is everything really, I'm not really locked down to one style. Movie is Favorite is Pulp Fiction. Hobbies, anything to do with calcio and going out with my mates.

#8- Yea i do play, I did a few sessions in Italy and was offered things here and there but I never took it up, I play as a centre defender usually but I have played as a defensive Midfielder or a Pirlo as of late.

I am also obsessed with AFL which is similar to NFL just a lot more crazier! You guys should check it out. My AFL team is also black and white, their name is the Collingwood Magpies, they just won the premiership last year. I have supported them all my life.

I don't really remember). I started to really follow them in the CL in 2003. I was cheering for Barcelona when Juve play them and I saw this blond winger that destroyed them.

#2- 31, I'm trying to finsih my MA thesis in philosophy/modern culture…



#3- It all began at the 1990 WC. Roberto Baggio just blew me away. And I loved the kit.





#4- Whoa all time? Hmm to choose those I've actually seen: Baggio, Tacchinardi, ADP. Players don't become favorites for me if they haven't played for Juve. The giants like Hansen, Boniperti, Scirea, Platini etc. sure all rank up there – but I go for ADP, LEGEND.



#5- Current; well Del Piero (rather inconsistent if not!) Former: Still playing? Trez! Least: Must be someone worse out there, but in recent history, Zebina.



#6- Favorite Juve moment? CL win '96, uefa cup '93, thrashing Milan 6-1 at the san siro 1997, real in the CL – a long list. Least favorite Juve moment? Last seasons complete meltdown. Never saw the spirit leave us like that before …Favorite sports moment of all time? The aforementioned + WC '06 and EC '92 (being Danish).



#7- Favorite music: Everything rock. From the Beatles to Black Metal, Love Pantera and the Flaming Lips! Hobbies: I play music myself (Vox/Guitar), and i do the blog www.ponderingcalcio.net with my mate, TT (Napoli fan but otherwise perfectly sane and pleasant!) Other than that i like quality beer, cycling (myself and following the pro peloton). I sometimes spare a moment for my GF and one-year-old son as well!

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"Suppose I should answer my own survey, here goes.

I'm originally from Rochester NY, grew up there and briefly in Chicago when I was younger. I'm Italian-American, Dad's side of the family is Pugliese (Bari/Foggia) in origin, Mom's side of the family is Anglo-Saxon (British/German) from Texas. Currently live in New Orleans.

I work in IT, doing several roles…onsite support, sometimes DBA/email admin, depends on what's going wrong. I work for Tulane University, which is where I went to college, worked for the IT dept in undergrad and still there for a year or two while I figure out what I want to do next. I'm 23 in a month.

Where'd Juve come from? Roby Baggio, USA. My favorite players are Tacchinardi, Del Piero, and Antonio Conte, in that order. Best player of all time, that I have personally witnessed (I'm rather young) is Zinedine Zidane. Just immense talent, I could watch his first touch all day long.

Favorite current player would be Alex Del Piero, Legro is also a big favorite of mine. Former player is Alessio Tacchinardi, no doubt…long-time readers will remember when I wrote under the name “alessio” and he was the reason. Least favorite Juventus player of all time, although I couldn't stand Emerson, goes to Z3BINA. 6 years at Juve, goddamn. Favorite Juve moment would be a toss-up between 5 Maggio, and “the” semi-final win over the Galacticos of Real, least favorite is relegation and last season…losing to Fulham and Bayern 4-1 hurt, a lot. Favorite sports moments of all time is Italia 2006.

I do enjoy playing footy, although I'm not very good, usually play in defense or as a regista. I am pretty good at tennis though. Like all sorts of music, movies, aside from blogging, I play video games a fair amount. (FIFA and Starcraft 2 are my favorites) Big fan of Buffalo Sabres and New Orleans Saints.

A year later, I was watching youtube videos of ADP, who happened to be on Juve. I started to follow them and support them around that time (right after they came back from serie b)

4. First is Del Piero. Second is Suarez . Third has to be Chiellini. Favorite player never to play for us is diego forlan. Best player of all time: baggio.

5. Del piero again. Former: Nedved. Least favorite? Z3BINA or amauri. I used to love amauri…then he died. more or less.

The best player of all time: In my era it's Zinedine Zidane, but I have to pick Michel Platini (Juventino, 3 consecutive player of the year, Champions league, scudettos… If only he won a world cup, I'm sure they would've considered him better than maradona)

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"#1: My name is Chukwueku, my parents are Nigerian but I was born and raised in the Netherlands. Speak Dutch and pretty good Spanish too (I'm taking my 6th year of Spanish at high school right now)and because of my Spanish I can roughly decipher some Italian (I also have a bunch of Italian friends, Interistas and Juventini). Sometimes I consider myself Dutch, sometimes I consider myself Nigerian (whichever one is more useful at the time, especially at airports, though I only have a Dutch passport) Moved to Charlotte, NC in July 2009.
#2: I'm 17 and a senior at High school. Probably gonna take an Economics Major (Bachelors of Arts)
#3: Corniest story ever. I was a very passionate footy fan (ofc, due to living in the Netherlands) but never chose a team. I was watching the Liverpool-Juventus CL game in 2005 and for some reason, I was supporting Juve (FT score was 2-1 for Liverpool) and I thought it was a very entertaining game and was really happy when Canna scored the 2-1. So at the end of the game I was like dude, it's about time I start supporting a team. So I chose Juve. Best decision of my life=)
#4: All time: Del Piero (Sempre il capitano!), Xavi (he makes the game look stupidly easy), and Ruud van Nistelrooy (such a legend). Fav player not to play for Juve: Gareth Bale or Rafeal Van Der Vaart. All time best: I'm only 17, so I don't really know any greats from back in the days, so either ADP, Cruyff, or Van Basten.
#5: Either Krasic, ADP, or Aquaman. Pavel Nedved is probably my favorite former Juventino. That piece of **** Amauri is my least favorite.
#6: The 2 legs vs. Real Madrid in 2008 CL and the 2-1 win vs. Inter last season. Least favorite was pretty much the whole season last season and Calciopoli (though it did bring me closer to Juve). When Federer finally won the freaking Roland Garros.
#7: I adore the beautiful game. Back in Netherlands played it a good 3-4 hours a week (also for club). Listen to pretty much all type of music, right now just listened to Billie Jean from MJ, but also listen to artists/groups like Tupac, Prince, A Tribe Called Quest, Duvel Duvel (Dutch artist), Greenday, Beegees, James Brown, Fela Kuti (brilliant Nigerian artist) etc etc.
#8: I started footy when I was 9yrs and played club soccer for a good 6ish years. Started out as a prima-punta (lol the good old days when I was a deadly striker) but then got down to earth and played defense. Last year played regista/carrilero for JV soccer team though and I quite like it. Unfortunately, I didn't make the Varsity team this year because my High School is insanely good and is actually playing the State Championships Final this Saturday (if interested, here are their results: http://www.myersparkhighschoolsports.com/Results.asp?snid=hCMAX3M4Y&org=myersparkhighschoolsports.com) But I hope to play in college. I like tennis and basketball is pretty alright too. I like Barca, Ajax, Valencia, Roger Federer.

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"My make up is complicated, but in short, I'm a naturalized US citizen of Palauan descent living on Guam the past many years.

I'm a part-time office manager of a construction company, full-time wife and mom, and I'm older than you.

We just started getting regular football on tv here a few years ago (too tired to count). My eye was caught by the likes of ADP, Nedved, Camo, Buffon, Davis and Trez.

My current favorite Juve player is Sissoko. Shaddap! The player I watch with a ton of respect for as a defender myself is Chiellini. My least favorite still playing for us is Amauri. I can't stand players who throw their arms up and whine all game long while the rest of the team is doing damage control after they lose the ball. Favorite former Juve player WAS Caceres… sniff sniff, but now Trez. Fave non-Juve player is Seedorf (with Pirlo close behind).

My taste in music runs the gamut. Favorite song at the moment is song by a local musician called “Infresi”. It's about having cultural pride. My pre-game songs for getting pumped are LL Cool J's “…Knock You Out”, “Regulate” by Warren G/Nate Dogg, and “Sexy Chic” by David Guetta. All time favorite movie, “Steel Magnolias”, and current fave is “Kung Fu Hustle”. My hobby is running. I have three half marathons under my belt and am training for my first full marathon in March of 2011.

I played footy for Guam's national team for 15 years, and still play in the local women's and 35+ co-ed league. For Guam I'm a defender by trade. I've played mostly at center, but have played LB here and there. In rec leagues I play either wing or up front as a second striker. After so many years in the back, I want some glory, man! I played basketball throughout high school. Kept the bench really warm and was my team's best cheer leader, ha! I sucked.

Falling for Juve after WC06, my answer is pretty much idenitcal to Weston's below. My faves ADP, Buffon, & Camo all happen to play for the same team!

Favorite current player is ADP w/ Gigi nipping at his heels (worth noting Georgio and Claudio are up there too). Former favorite Juve player is Camoranesi and favorite non Juve is Pirlo.

I think the Italy vs Germany WC06 is one of my fondest sporting memories! The game that sparked my obsession with footy.

I like playing guitar, cooking, good beer/wine, trying to teach myself Italian, and I'm a big Dallas Cowboys fan. I try to play in a pick-up game at least once a week if i can.

#1- From Mumbai, India. Indian. Living in Austin, TX as of now.
#2- Grad student in Computational & Applied Math. 25.
#3- Some of the defining moments were Camoranesi's goal in Europe (Olympiakos was it? I forgot) and Del Piero's goal in South Korea 2002. When I heard the kind of reception he received when he came on the field, I knew he was a special person.. from a special club.
#4- Del Piero, Nedved, Thuram. Maldini. Maradona.
#5- Del Piero. Nedved. I have to say Amauri because I've never hated a Juve player as much as I hate him right now.
#6- UCL 2003 semi. Morattopoli. Germany 2006.
#7- Music: Rammstein all the way. It's the only band whose more than half songs I love. Apart from that, I like the best songs of Iron Maiden, Led Zep, Pink Floyd, RATM. Movies: Pulp Fiction, The Big Lebowski, Fight Club. Hobbies: Gaming, maybe. Lots of it. Also I sometimes write on http://www.footballitaliano.co.uk/
#8- I played for exactly one year in my first year of college. Although the formation was hard to define because of the free-for-all nature of the game, I would say left-back is the closest you can get. Don't follow any other sport. Maybe India in a cricket World Cup and Ferrari in F1. Other teams I like – Ferrari, Valencia and Milan (yes.. I've always had a soft corner for them)

2. Student, do part time jobs in the greatest place you could find here, I work in all the sporting grounds in Perth, ie. I get to see every Dockers, WCE and Cricket games for free (Ashes are coming !!!!) age. 22

3. It is a little story when I was in high school I had this friend whose family lives in Italy. So this one time he went on a holiday and there was this another friend of mine who was a kinda school football player. He had asked my friend who went on holiday to bring him a football jersey. and When the Guy returned he brought Juventus no 11 jersey with him. (not Amauri.the guy before him) and That was it. I searched all about that jersey and became a fan.

4. Del Piero, Nedved, Buffon, (ii) Klass Jan Huntelaar (strenge??? lol) (iii)Ronaldo (the original)
5. Del Piero, Baggio, Patrick Viera. (I like him when at Arsenal not in Juve)
6. Del Piero Demolish the white house twice in CL two seasons ago. least fav.. Calciopoli . Fav Sport Moment. Sri Lanka wins Cricket Worldcup 1998.

7.music. Metal . Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth, Rammstein, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Priest,
and Depeche Mode. Movies…..Bourne series. and the Matrix series.(aka the greenest movie ever made) hobbies… nothing much lately. into tasting fragrances lately. (ya Im'a bit weird)

8. Well footy ..hah telling football( soccer) footy in here usually brings up a debate anyway. I used to play a bit in school. mainly midfield, att mid. Other sports, Cricket, … other teams I like Sri Lanka, Australia West Indies, and South Africa cricket teams, Wallabies, and Springboks….Valentino Rossi (not a team but I like the guy anyway) and Mr. Bolt.

After that, he joined Juve and I started to follow the world of bianconeri. Great players from toto schillaci, vialli, ravanelli, paolo sousa, didi deschamps, montero, ferrara, peruzzi to buffon, cannavaro, thuram, zambrotta, nedved, zidane, inzaghi, and il capitano adp fill my days. From all of them, the 3 personal favorites are: Roby Baggio, who is the classiest fantasista at that time; Pavel Nedved, an embodiment of the word GRINTA; and Gigi Buffon, arguably the best GK of all time.

By following Juve I also learned a lot of other players. Two great players I wish play for Juve are:

and my 2nd favorite player of all time (well, since 1990 to be precise, when I started watching live-football):
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PNFpayoUD8 with this one highlighted his career: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9I6rOtCYR0

And of course, as in every universe, there is a god in each of them. And this is the god of football:

I have to admit, I only watched every Juve's game from 1990 to 1998. From 1998, I studied abroad where there were no live coverage of serieA (only aussie footy and cricket… meh) and after that, work didn't permit me to watch football often. But this season, thanks to internet, I started to watch every game again. Aside from ADP, my favorite current Juve player is:

Well, that's Juve and me. I myself listen a broad range of music: from van halen, def leppard, bon jovi to johnny cash, sarah brightman, norah jones, il divo, and jason mraz.

I used to play football in college, usually as a CM. Not very good though :) but I was a competitive swimmer and roller-skater and has been playing basketball for the past 20 years. Outside of Juve, I follow NBA and the Phoenix Suns and Ferrari in F1.

#2. I'm a grad student (geotechnical engineer), 30 yrs old.
#3. How did I become a fan? I started following the team in early 90s while playing a computer game, I picked juve out of luck of all the teams. We couldn't see many Serie A games in Peru at that time so actually became a fan (and started following every match, reading about the team every day and pretty much basing my whole routine around juve) after Nedved's yellow card against Madrid in 03 (what an emotive moment!). After that, I read, watch and play whatever I can about juve.
#4. R. Baggio, Del Piero, Nedved. My fav player that didn't play for juve: Maldini. Best player of all time: R. Baggio.
#5. Fav current player: ADP. Favorite former player: Nedved (I miss him!!!!). Least fav juventino: Ibrahimovic.
#6. Fav juve moment: Champions league 2003 and all of our victories after Calciopoli (it's going to be hard but we will be back!). Least fav juve moment: Calciopoli. Fav sporting moment: Italy wining the world cup in 06.
#7. Music: Joaquín Sabina. Movies: Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Hobbies: Playing soccer, playing PES2010, and playing dungeons and dragons (thought I had to quit the last one cuz I was moving to Vancouver).
#8. I play regularly but not in a league, and I'm not very good at it. I play central defense and I love it. I enjoy the most when the rest of the team is really tired and they won't come back to defend so I'm left behind with the other CB to handle 4 or 5 attackers… I really like the challenge! I'm starting to get into Hockey, but it's fairly new to me. I also like and play Tennis (from time to time).

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"I'm from the country of wafels, chocolate and fries… Maybe it rings a bell… Belgium of course ;).

#2- Now I'm a student in Belgium, in sports sciences and physiotherapy, 21 yr old and I'm trying to get an Erasmus (abroad studying) in Rome for my project to study the youth teams of AS Roma. So hopefully next year (and no, there was no such thing in Turin :p)

#3- It all started for me in '96. Me and my parents always took our holidays in Italy and me being a young 7-yr old soccer player, I just craved for a jersey.
I do not remember which jersey I wanted, was it one from Inter, Lazio, Roma or Milan, but I do remember it was the so called absolute-superstar name and it shouldn't have been a Juve jersey. Maybe the Azzurri, but not Juventus.
Well, we arrived in this nice store in Firenze, I can still imagine the exact street and location of the store, but all those jerseys were sold out. I was stubborn as hell (still am) and only wanted that jersey, but the lady of the store told me the chances of me finding one were slim to none. The lady tried to convince me to buy another jersey, from the next “superstar” in Italian football…. Of course being the Del Piero jersey with SONY on it, hanging on my wall right next to me. Already having been though numerous shops, my dad was getting cranky and he was in on the conspiracy, trying to convince me and I gave in with the thought I was going home without any jersey at all if I didn't…
I was disappointed as I couldn't brag about anything with this jersey when training was about to begin next season. But soon after Del Piero scored some magnificent goals in the CL and Serie A and started to get publicly known all over the world, which made me certain I had made the right choice (by pure luck). It was unique, as all the other kids had Barce-fucking-lona jerseys but it wasn't one bit less valueable to me.

I started following the team a bit more closer when I had my own computer, etc. etc.. The CL run in 2003 (back-to-back wins over Barcelona and Real Madrid) was a huge leap for me towards supporting Juve and my love for juventus exploded when calciopoli struck. A typical case of “You don't know what you're missing 'till it's gone”. The feeling of injustice towards my favourite team burned and from there on I watched almost every game. The year in serie B was the first time I went looking for streams every week, but it was worth it all the way!

#4- Del Piero of course, Nedved and simply our pitbull Davids with Buffon a close fourth. My favourite player never to play for Juventus is probably Il Fenomeno Ronaldo 9. I'd say he was the best in the world as well, at least the best that I saw in my lifetime.

#5- Difficult choice to say who's my favourite right now because choosing between Chiellini, Del Piero or Buffon would tear me apart.
As for as an ex-juventino, it would be Davids. I simply loved the way he combined spirit with ability, unmatched by anyone else. Nedved came close and if Zambrotta wouldn't have betrayed us, he would've bene up there as well.
My least favourite Juventino is Tiago. I just can not stand the guy… And he is still benefiting from us…

#6- My favorite Juve moment is difficult… Either the serie B championship or the victories over Barca and Real in 2003.
My least favorite of course being Calciopoli in the summer.
My favorite sporting moment is the 2006 WC, behind my own match/tournament winning goals of course :)

#7- Favorite music/movies/hobbies?

#8- I do play football myself and I'm the Terzino'ed right winger. I do play right back now. I'm interested in a lot of other sports as it is my field of course, but I do play squash regularly myself. I also support “Club Brugge” in Belgium, but way less than Juve.

#2 business journalist, 25
#3 became a fan in the mid 90s…great era…ADP, Zidane,…so many great players and perfect tactics
#4 Platini, Nedved, ADP. fav never to have played for Juve: Herbert Prohaska (despite being Interista for 1 year…). best of all time: Zidane (who didn’t make top 3 of all Juve players of all time)
#5 Chiellini, Buffon, ADP, but right now there are so many other great and often young players in the squad: Krasic, Quagliarella, Aquilani etc. this is a squad fort he future i guess
#6 many but last year‘s best and worst remain quite memorable because they happened within just a few days: win vs inter, loss vs bayern
#7 electronic music, movies in general, nightlife…but since there are so many fans of rammstein here i can at least admit that i attended a live show a few years ago and their performance was impressive
#8 I prefer a combination of fitness center and fifa 11. Better than experiencing how much I probably suck on the pitch by now  other clubs: i support the smallish austrian club sv ried and of course the austrian national team and – in case they didn’t qualify fort he actual tournament (which is the case most of ´the times) – both azzurri and oranje. and as a good austrian football fan i’ve already been taught as a child to be happy if the germans or fc bayern lose :)",Juergen ,"Nov 19, 2010 ", 8:59 AM,

#2 I am a trainer/consultant working for a software products company. I am 31.

#3 I must admit I am a newbie to calcio. I am only following Juve/Calcio for the last couple of years. First time I watched footy was USA 94. Of course, I liked Baggio and in 2002 I remember one of my friend mentioning 'Del Piero is the new Baggio'. I was in Milan during 2006 World cup, stayed just behind the cathedral & used to watch matches in the big screen in duomo. Alex was probably the only football player I knew that time. After following Italy the whole tournament and falling in love with Alex during the course of the tournament, I started checking up on Juve every once in a while. Around 2008, I stopped following cricket after my fav. cricket hero Saurav Ganguly retired & jumped to football. Since then I have following Juve fulltime.

#4 Who are your 3 favorite players of all time? Del Piero, Baggio & Buffon.
Favorite player never to play for Juve? Beckham
Who’s the best player of all time? Baggio

#5- Who’s your favorite current Juventus player? Del Piero
Favorite former Juventino? Caceres
Least favorite Juventino of all time? Tiago

#6- Favorite Juve moment? Win against Real madrid in both legs in 2008, esp. the one at Santiago Bernebeu when Alex scored both goals.
Least favorite Juve moment? Home game against Bayern last season
Favorite sports moment of all time? Fav. football moment must be when Alex scored in the semi finals of 2006 WC.

#7- Favorite music: AC/DC, Beatles, MJ, Josh Groban, AR Rahman.. the list is long
Movies: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Apocalypto, In the mood for love, Reservoir Dogs.. Again the list is long
Hobbies? Dancing & Juventus

#8 Do you play footy yourself? I only started playing last year & I love it. I try my best to find the opportunity to play these days.
If so, what position? I hardly know. Being a newbie in whatever group I play, I mostly end up playing defense.
What other sports do you like? I used to follow Cricket & Tennis, not so much these days.
What other teams (of any sports) do you like? Kolkata Knight Riders (Cricket team in Indian league)

#2 – I'm 26, I work a few different jobs.
#3 – In 1996 I was 12, and the only football team I really liked was Blackburn Rovers in England, mainly because everyone else I knew loved Man Utd. But my cousin was really into Ajax for some reason, and was following them all through their Champions League season. We both liked watching Gazzetta Football Italia on Channel 4, so when the CL final swung around and we were watching it together, I recognized the black and white of Juventus facing off against his Ajax. I decided to support them for that match, to make it interesting. They won. It stuck.
#4 – Favourite three players I have seen play for Juventus are Del Piero, Zidane, and Buffon, and ADP is easily my all time favourite player. Favourite players I've never seen play for Juventus, or who likely never will? It's a long list, but these names spring to mind: Weah, Keane, Xavi, Iniesta, Kaka, Bergkamp, Pirlo, Messi, Pastore… I really don't know who the best player of all time is, but I'm excited to be living at a time when Messi is playing, because I think he's got the talent and enough years ahead to be considered one of the all-time greats.
#5 – Favourite current Juventus player is Del Piero, obviously. Favourite former is probably Zidane, though Thuram, Ferrara, Tacchinardi, Davids, and Cannavaro spring to mind too. Baggio as well. Least favourite Juventino? Probably Ibrahimovic, though Amauri gives him a run for his money. Inzaghi too.
#6 – There have been too many favourite Juventus moments to list, but my least favourites are easier: every CL final defeat since that victory over Ajax, and Calciopoli, particularly the fallout and having to put up with all sorts of ignorant comments about it because of how badly it was reported over here. Favourite sports moment of all time are the two perfect minutes at the end of Germany v Italy in 2006, when I lost my voice from cheering. I can't see those ever being topped.
#7 – I like too much music to list, but this year it has mostly been hip-hop and dubstep. Favourite movies? I like film noir (my favourite movie is Sunset Boulevard), but the best thing I've seen in 2010 was Un prophète. Main hobbies are reading and writing.
#8 – I played football a lot in school and was decent at it, playing as a sort of trequartista and doing flashy things that only sometimes came off. As I got older and less fit I dropped into a sort of Pirlo role. I'm pretty terrible now, mainly because I am completely out of shape. I don't really support any other sports teams the way I do Juventus (apart from the Irish and Italian national sides), but my second favourite football team in Italy is Palermo. My favourite English football team is probably Norwich, because I lived there for a year. I also like American football a bit and have supported the Saints for a few years now (I know, I know). And I like rugby a little bit and support Leinster and Ireland.",ShakeAppeal ,"Nov 19, 2010 ", 11:16 AM,

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"Wow, I wish hadn't gotten to this party so late.

#1 – I currently live in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, which is just 4 miles outside of Philadelphia, the best and worst city in America. Strictly opinion ;-) I was born in Philadelphia, to a mother of Irish heritage and a father of Polish heritage. I joke that I'm half-Polish/half-Irish which means I'm too stupid to get drunk.
#2 – I am an Audio Visual Support Coordinator. I setup and handle problems with audio visual equipment for a large pharmaceutical company. I also use the same technology at home, so my home theatre is most likely more awesome than your home theatre!
#3 – My wife was studying in Europe a few years ago, and we had the opportunity to go to Italy. I instantly fell in love with everything Italy. I met someone who was telling me about the greatest thing in the world in his life: calcio. I went home and bought FIFA '08 and I played the Serie A season. I had gotten laid off and I had a lot of time on my hands, so I went and did research on all the Serie A teams of 2008. The team that I felt most connected to was Juventus. I read all about the scandal and I read about how many of the players had accepted that fate, and stayed with the club to get it back to the top level. That was the sign to me of a club I wanted to follow. It also didn't hurt that we share the same first initial: J. The more I read and researched about Juve, the more I fell in love. I made sure to go out of my way to watch their matches, and root for their success. By the third match I watched, I was hooked. I had fallen in love. Even though I've only been following this club for 2 years, I feel like I have a deep connection with them. I want to see them succeed, and I love to watch them fight in every match for each victory. I am also a fan of my hometown team, the Philadelphia Union, in Major League Soccer. The moment I saw them play, I fell in love, and I go to all of their home matches, and I make sure I watch every one on TV. 5 years ago, I knew nothing about soccer, and I thought it was stupid. Then I learned. I taught myself the game, and read and followed it. Now, I can't get enough of it! I want to learn so much more that I started to learn Italian, so I can read the news on places like Tuttojuve, without having to use Google translate, and have it all mucked up. My favorite Italian phrase so far is “Caccati in mano e prenditi a schiaffi” which means “Shit in your hand, and hit yourself.” I don't know why, but that's funny to me.
#4 – Since I haven't been following long, my favorite 3 players are Milos Krasic, Sebastien Le Toux, and Sebastian Giovinco. Le Toux is the best player on my hometown team, the Philadelphia Union. He never, ever stops running, he's immensely talented, and he makes every player on his team better. I love la Formica Atomica because he's got tremendous talent, and he proves that it's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog. When he's not hurt, I love to watch him play. As for Krasic, what more can you say about him? From the flight he chartered for himself to be in Turin on time, to telling everyone how much he wanted to be a Juventino, to the hat trick and the jersey kiss that made my heart melt, to the fact that watching him play is like watching the most beautiful music being made, I just love everything about this man. Milos Krasic è bello calcio!
#5 – My current favorite Juventino is Milos Krasic, and my favorite former player would be, I guess Giovinco. I also miss Antonio Candreva from last year. I think he would've been a good player to keep.
#6 – My favorite Juve moment was when they beat Meeeeeelan at the San Siro this year. When Del Piero scored, I jumped out of my chair and hollered loudly. I delayed picking my mother-in-law up from the airport just to see the end of that match. Later that night, I went to Halloween party wearing my jersey and scarf. Someone asked me who I was, and I said, “I'm dressed as a very happy man!” My least favorite Juve moment was watching them quit toward the end of the 09-10 season, and you could actually see them quitting. I was also disappointed that they seemed to not really care in the least when they came to New York City to play against the Red Bulls. It was so sad to watch them play like they were only there to collect a paycheck, and not try to delight the thousands who have supported them from as far as 6,000 miles away. That hurt a lot. My favorite sports moment in getting to see the Phillies win the World Series in 2008. After the final out, I ran over to my brother, I jumped in his arms, and I cried tears of joy. We then went outside and sprayed each other with champagne. After all of those years of futility, to witness that, and to be able to do it with my dad, my brother, and my wife, that is a memory I will carry with me forever.
#7 – I love movies, but I'm particular about music. My favorite hobby is traveling. Among other things I enjoy are playing sports games on my PS3, panoramic photographs, and playing softball on Sundays.
#8 – I don't play footy because I'm pretty fat and out of shape. During the summer, my brother and I go out and kick the ball around for an hour, and we usually come back really, really sore. I love baseball (My first love), ice hockey, and American football. I used to be a broadcaster of baseball and ice hockey, so I truly love those two sports. My favorite teams are the Philadelphia Phillies (baseball, my first love), the Philadelphia Flyers (ice hockey), and the Philadelphia Union (Major League Soccer). Two of the teams I broadcasted for that I really loved and very much miss are the Valley Forge Freedom (ice hockey) and the Philadelphia Scorpions (American football).
#9 – I'm not on Twitter, but I am on Facebook and BigSoccer.

6) My favorite Juve moment isn't really a Juve moment per se. But when Alex scored against Germany in the semi-finals in 2006, I have never felt more proud to support Juventus and the Azzurri. Least favorite moment/s: watching Inter grasp the trophy with blood on their hands any year after 2006.
7) Love hip hop. Lots of favorite movies but I enjoy most Wes Anderson flicks (Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited, etc).

16 years old,student.

The end of the 04/05 season when del piero put in “that” cross for trez at the san siro.

My 3 favourite players ever would be del piero,nedved and buffon.my favourite non-juventino would be cruyff i would have really liked him with juve.him with tardelli and boninsegna for protection would be mega,a bit like milan with rivera in the 60s.

My favourite current juventini would be krasic,marchisio and chiellini(since i already picked buffon and del piero amongst my favourite players,i decided to go with the younger players in our team).I'd say my favourite former juve player would be nedved,i just absolutely love the guy.His goals,non stop running and enthusiasm is just an inspiration.my least favourite juventino would be zebina,nuff said.

My favourite juve moment would be the scudetto in 05/06,my least favourite juve moment would be last years game at home to bayern munich.My favourite sporting moment would be italy lifting the WC in 06,not because i'm an italy fan but because everyone always slags off italy before every tournament and it was made even sweeter with the farce that was taking place in italy at the time

My favoured type of music would be punk,ska,indie,rock,rap,dance and some techno.The last movie i watched,and also one of my favourites, would be a clockwork orange.I dont really have a hobby,i just enjoy mucking about with my friends and acting the fool.

I do indeed play footie myself and i play in goal,no points for guessing who inspired me.I do also watch womens tennis,i prefer it because the games are shorter than the mens but ofcourse thats not the only reason…………………",FoolOnTheHill94 ,"Nov 19, 2010 ", 12:25 PM,

#2- I'm a software engineer, doing all sorts of programming and stuff. 24 years old.

#3- I always played soccer when I was younger but didn't follow Europe at all until I had it on TV, but always played the video games too. Juventus had the most players I knew like Del Piero, Camoranesi etc, so it made it easier to follow. I'll say I really started to follow around the 2006 World Cup or a bit before that.

#4- 3 fav: Del Piero, Iaquinta, Buffon. Who are your 3 favorite players of all time? Best player of all time I have no clue, haven't followed that long. Favorite to not play for Juve I have no idea either.

#5- Favorite would be Marchisio I think. Former would be Camoranesi, and least favorite would have to be Zebina or Molinaro. Sorry was just reading some responses, Amauri has to be up there for least favorite as well.

#6- I can't nail down an absolute favorite right now, a good recent memory is Del Piero owning Real Madrid in Spain. Least favorite moment would Sissoko's red card bicycle kick clearance at our own box against Reggina or some low level team a few seasons ago to lose the game like 3-2 if I recall correctly. Favorite sports moment – there are a few. Live from what I've seen: Del Piero at Red Bulls stadium, watching Virginia Tech beat West Virginia in NCAA Football in the rain, attended game 6 (last one) of 1996 World Series at Yankees Stadium, and seeing Gary Sheffield hit his 500th HR at Citi Field - From TV: Del Piero's goal against Germany in 2006 WC.

#7- Music I can listen to a variety of things, not that into music. One of my favorite movies is Top Gun lol, fascinated with planes when I was younger. Hobbies include playing/watching tons of sports, weightlifting and learning to code Android apps.

#8- I play footy on and off now. Always defense for the most part, or midfield when my teammates can't run for an entire match. I'll watch pretty much any sport besides golf I'd say. Mets/Knicks/Jets. I used to play rugby in high school and in college too, so that is always fun to watch.

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"1. Um really do I have to answer this…figure it out considering my name on here.

2. 27- Real Estate Accounting…zzzzzzzzzzzzz…thus why i spend so much damn time on here!

3. Really was born into it, my dad was Juventino from calabria, moved here when he was 20. My first memories were probably when i was 5-6 years old. My parents were divorced so my dad had me on weekends. Every sunday he took me to “cafe dello sport” in Boston's North End, to watch juve with his friends. At first I hated it and was sooo bored during games, but after a few years grew to love it, and when I lived in the north end myself a few years ago, would still go to cafe dello sport to watch games for old times sake.

4. 3 favorite players: 1. Roberto Baggio (also my best player of all time), originally loved him when i was young because my name is Roberto as well, but as i started to play calcio and followed juve/azzurri, i appreciated his talents more and more. I went to all the italy games in USA 94 except for the final (thank god)! 2. Van Basten- loved his game, his “forbiciatta” (spelling?) was probably my favorite goal ever. 3. Baresi- My dads favorite player ever, considering he was a juve fan to give that sorta respect just shows what a player he was. In my book, the best defender ever. Playing through his age too was incredible.

5. 1. Baggio 2. Del Piero, no need to explain why. 3. Edgar Davids! Loved how hard he played, and had underrated ball skills for being such a “bulldog”. Plus I was a huge stoner/pothead in high school & college, so yea that explains that lol. Current player: Aquilani-classy, italian, and everything that Totti never was. Least Favorite: Amauri. Doesnt deserve an explanation why.

6. Favorite juve moment: This is Azzuri, but Baggio scoring two goals against Nigeria in the 89th and then extra time, all with 10 men. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa8FtLkd0ko

That lob pass to Benarrivo to earn the pentaly, just wow. Dude was pure class.

7. As an ex-pothead, I still listen to my Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, Paul Simon, Sublime, Sinatra. As for hobbies, I love standup comedy, and playing pretty much any sport I can, as long as its competitive.

8. Yes I still play in a mens league, as a trequartista/fantaista behind the two forwards. Shocker considering my favorite player was one Mr. Baggio. Yea I'm only slightly worse than him too ;) Oh and I'm also a diehard Celtics fan, I've had season tix for 5 years now.

I started following Juventus when I was about 4 years old. My brother and I always use to watch the Italian football on CH4 and I asked him who was the team in the black and white? He answered Juventus and since then I have followed and supported Juve.

3 favourite players of all time? Hmmm:
Number 1 – ADP,
Number 2 – Zizu,
Number 3 – Messi

Favourite player never to play for Juve? Still could happen but I would Berbatov to play for us. I am a MASSIVE Berbatov fan.
Who’s the best player of all time? I still say Zidane but I reckon Messi will surpass him in due course.
Who’s your favourite current Juventus player? Seeing that ADP is my favourite player of all time it should really be him. But currently in the squad I’m loving Quagliarella. Favorite former Juventino? I loved Mark Iuliano but it has to be Paolo Montero, just for his tackles and the Juve-never-say-die-attitude. Least favorite Juventino of all time? Zebina. I won’t waste mentioning time typing to write more than that.
My favourite Juve moment which I remember is 1995–96 UEFA Champions League final. I was young but remember it well. My least comes at a time where it was one of the best days in my life. The first time I’ve got to see Juventus play live at Craven Cottage against Fulham. I was buzzing all week about it. Went crazy when Trez scored and thought that had sealed us to the next round. Only to what happened after to kill me inside. So shocking.
I’m a massive cricket fan as well as Football and so the England cricket team winning the ashes back in 2005 was amazing. I do play football, I’m an attacking left winger. Just because I have lots of pace and can shoot ;D. My main playing sport is cricket though where I’ve been playing semi professional for a while and maybe could become professional in the near future.

Played in every position except goalie, midfield most often. Other sports: ice hockey, handball, judo, but mad about sports in general.

#2- Grad Student, Economics, will soon be 28.
#3- It was in the elementary school. We started to talk about calcio. A good friend of mine was Parmagiani. Most of my friends however were Milanisti. For unknown reason, I was not interested to join the Milan bandwagon. In search for a team to be supported, I read an article about Juventus in newspaper. And on the week-end, the TV broadcasted Juve match. Since then, I follow Juventus until this very moment. The next good thing is that both my younger brother are also Juventini.
#4- Ciro Ferrara (I was very sad knowing that he couldn't go the world cup in 1998 because of the injury), Pavel Nedved (I was literally in tears twice: 1st, when he got the yellow card that prevented him to play in the UCL Final, and 2nd in the last match he played in Juve jersey), and Antonio Conte (A great captain. Me and my brothers used to call him Antonio Captain). Soft spot too for Jugovic, Angelo Peruzzi, and Didier Deschamps :-). Favorite player never play to Juve? Davor Suker :D Best player? Zidane of course.
#5- Chiellini (because he, read somewhere, got a degree in Economics too :-)
Favorite former Juventino? Trez, no doubt. Least favorite Juventino of all time? Tiago or Zebina
#6- Favorite Juve moment? When they beat Milan 6-1 (I was there watching it Live!!!) and of course Juve-Roma 1996. Least favorite Juve moment? When we lost scudetto the last day to Lazio. F*** Colllina. Favorite sports moment of all time? not sure

#3 I stuided abroad during undergrad in Spain. While there I became close friends with a Juventini from Turin and started to instantly follow them along with the Spanish NT. I've been a European footy junkie ever since really. Also a big fan of tottenham. My friends in the states couldn't believe I came back from Europe talking about soccer and watching games all weekend.

#4 Del Piero, Nedved, David Villa…and is my fav player never to play for Juve

#5 Favorite current players are DP and Chells. Favorite former Juventino has to be Pavel, but I'm upset with how the grooming/departure of Giovinco went. Least favorite is a tie between Poulsen and Amauri

#6 Favorite Juve moment? Serie B chip, CL victories over Real (as I'm friends with soo many Real fans) and anytime I've turned on a Juve game to see Amauri not in the XI. ALL TIME – I went to South Africa for the World Cup, went to four diff games and the whole experience was amazing, plus Spain won they're first ever campeonato.

#2) I study Political Science and Italian…

#3) Juve found me… I can't even narrow down the moment when I fell in love with the team. It's like I came out of the womb loving Juve and hating i disgraziati d'Italia aka Inter!

#4) I find it really hard to narrow it down to three players. First and foremost of course, ADP. That man is class.. he's indescribable! I love Maldini too.. he's kind of like ADP, the last of those “old school” kinda players…wow this is hard. I have mad love for Trez (more so his mom in the stands LOL)….. Roberto Baggio I think is who really brought me to the game…and Paolo Rossi when my dad used to always talk about him and how incredible he was. I wanted to be just like him too. Oh, and HOW COULD I EVER forget…. Riky KAKA!! (Aside the fact that he saved myself AND my sister from being arrested…true story, tweet me and I'll fill u in on the details lol) he is class. I love watching him play. I'm still sad he left Milan, because I liked seeing him play in Italy. What has Real done for his career anyways…a whole lot of NIENTEEEEEE!

#5) CURRENT FAV, is and always will be, C'E SOLO UN CAPITANOOOOO….. ALESSANDRO DEL PIERO ALEEEEE! <3
Fav non Juventus player: Paolo Maldini, Giovinco, (breaks my heart that I'm classifying him as non-juve), and I've always had a soft spot for Mesto, being that he repped Reggina quite well (as did PIRLO! woo)
FORMER FAV: Pavel Nedved + David Sergio Trezegol. I would sell my soul to meet them for five minutes.
LEAST FAV PLAYER: Oh man, this is SOOO easy…… Zlatan Ibra$hitabitch……sorry for the profanity. The hate I have for that dirty gipsy (I know, he's not a gipsy lol), can't even be put into words. I can't stand him. From the second I saw his face, I couldn't stand him. I would give back every goal he's ever scored to have him never have worn the jersey I love. Harsh, I know…but what has he done for US, the fans. Nothing. I rest my case. He's at the perfect squad, he fits in well with a team full of degenerates. I also have a lot of love for Carolina Morace (google her, if u don't already know who she is. she's bascially Italy's version of Mia Hamm..aka the love of my life lmao). She coached in Serie C (not for a long time), but she's currently residing in Toronto and cleaning it up for the Canadian womens team as their head coach. See, Italian coaches everywhere. Calcio sure is our game!!

#6) MOST FAVOURITE MOMENT: Knocking on the hotel room door of Luigi Pocchetino (Juve Physiotherapist) when Juve was in Toronto in May 2010. I convinced him I was a legit Juve fan, he told me to return in the morning with my jersey. I saw him outside of the hotel the following morning, he remembered my name and as he said hello to me, he took the jersey from my hand and said “hai una penna?” OF COURSE I HAD A PEN, duhh!! Sure enough, two hours later, he emerges from the hotel with BOTH mine and my sisters jerseys completely signed by the ENTIRE squad. I may not have met Trez or Del Piero, but they had my jersey in their hands! diessss

ALSO, a second fav moment: When Juventus had arrived to Toronto, I thought to call some of the “classier” hotels to see if I could find them. Sure enough, the first hotel I called, I asked to speak to Salihamdzic and they connected me. Sure, if u can spell Salihamdzic, then they must know you're legit LOL. Sure enough , I left a voicemail. The next day, he and Trez called me back on my cell phone. The last 10sec or so of the ten min call are on my Facebook. Talk about being speechless. I still cannot believe to this day, that I spoke to actual Juventus players. Or, that when I met Hasan and Grosso outside of the hotel and said who I was, that they both laughed…and understood exactly who I was. Not gloating (by any means!) I'm just STILL in shock so many months later.
#7) Hobby: Soccer, soccer and soccer. Music: I like a lot of house, trance and Italian music…..but I listen to everything BUT country. Movies: Foreign! Although I enjoy pretty much every genre
#8) I've played since I could walk…..I'm a midfield, left wing. I like to shoot from la zona Del Piero and I kill it every time (well I'd like to think so haha). Have had opportunities to play abroad, but having an off the boat father doesn't always help ones cause! haha. I play competitive (province wide) during the summer…. plus competitive indoor in the winter + 2 days of pick up. What can I say, I love my soccer!

#4. 3 faves: Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Alex Del Piero.
Fave never to Juve? Of course David Beckham. This last 15 years, i've always dream him wearing black-white. Best player of all time, i would say Diego Maradona.
#5. Current: Milos 'motherf**king' Krasic.
Former: David Trezegooll.

Juventus Offside Meet & Greet,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 18, 2010, 10:10am PST",,"Where are you from? What nationality are you? Where are you living now?
Born here in Melbourne, but natured and nurtured by England and my crimson rivers flow with a vibrant mix of sicilian and anglo blood. By flesh, sicilian/english, by passport english/australian. Presently I reside back here in Melbourne…

#2- What do you do for a living? (Or what’s your major, if you’re a student) How old are you? (general time frame is fine if you don’t want specific!)
I work as a courier for the city council, played in the jolly jester, spreading chinese humour and good cheer with the mail and files and plan tubes…at 31 years old, my main pursuits in life are wicked women, fast motorbikes, passion, and wordsmithery…(and of course football)

#3- How did you become a fan of your team? When did you start following them?
I also unfortunately support Gillingham…as for Juve, I was 12 years old, and wondering, finally, why everyone else at school had surnames like Brown, and Jacobs, and Smith, and mine was…obviously something latin. My mother explained that my absent padre was a sicilian fiend of the lowest order, i was pleased, and took it upon myself to start accepting and embracing my previously unknown roots…I saw Vialli, loved his style, and laughed at the zebra stripes. That was that.

#4- Who are your 3 favorite players of all time? Favorite player never to play for Juve? Who’s the best player of all time?
Cantona is likely at the top of the list. Whilst I rarely enjoy french men (the women YES), as the english parts of me despise the haughtiness, arrogance and snobbish snorts and chortles, which seem to run deep into the innards of the frogmen, Cantona was something different, something very special indeed. His arrogance was different to his compatriots, as it seemed to tie in more with his rather extreme fiery temper and poetry, both on and off the field, and when he crunched that Palace supporter, he became a hero of mine for all time. He lived by his own rules, in hiw own world, and brought so much fantasy to the game in england…I should mention Roberto Baggio, and Torricelli, and Ravanelli, with only Baggio making it into my top three. The third would be…Cannavaro in his prime. The most perfectly cultured superthug I have ever seen don boots and head into battle. Countless times my heart sang with joy as he poleaxed opponents, came away with the ball, then offered his victim a wry smile of victory. Best player of all time eh??? Had I been watching cruyff in his prime, he would likely have the title, same with Maradona, but in my time, it has to be Zidane.

#5- Who’s your favorite current Juventus player? Favorite former Juventino? Least favorite Juventino of all time?
Probably Buffon…even my neoplitan mates who despise Juve, doff their hat in reluctant respect, sometimes even in starry eyed reverence. But as he is absent with leave, presently, of the fit and playing crop, I would have to say Chiellini. Although Melo is fast becoming a favourite. I like the lunatics…whose zeal for the club and game as a whole wins my devotion and pride with ease. Least favourite of all time would be…Amauri. Dead weight, for so many moons now. Favourite former…Zidane.

#6- Favorite Juve moment? Least favorite Juve moment? Favorite sports moment of all time?
Favourite moment of recent times was Melo's dance against Milan. Least favourite…the whole of last season. Favourite of all time???Cantona scoring a brilliant goal, perhaps against Arsenal, soon after, or straight after returning from his lengthy ban.

#7- Favorite music/movies/hobbies?
I am a fervent Sage Francis fan. Hobbies include writing, riding, women, vodka, rum…some of my most enjoyed movies are Dead Mans Shoes, Leon, Scarface…

#8- Do you play footy yourself? If so, what position? What other sports do you like? What other teams (of any sports) do you like?
Used to play football for many years, always as a left back or centreback. Motogp interests me, but few other sports…",Thegutterpoet ,"Nov 20, 2010 ", 4:01 AM,

#2) I am 21 years old, a student at the university of kent state. majoring in architecture—with a concentration in urban design and planning.
#3)I become a fan post-calcipoli. I went to Italy in 2006 for the first time and in meeting my family over there, they introduce me to italian soccer and they were fans of juventus, so i joined them because as my uncle and cousins said “there the best of the best”.
#4) Del Piero, Buffon, Donovan. favorite to never play for juve: Kaka, love his heart and passion for the game, lot of respect for that man. best of all time, via highlights and such i would say a tie between zidane and dp.
#5) Del Piero is my favorite along with Marchisio, Chiellini and Krasic. favorite former juventino is Nedved. least favorite is Amauri
#6) the first win against intermerda after the return from serie b. least favorite moment is any loss in general, but specifically the loss at home to Chelsea (roommate is a big chelsea fan). favorite sports moment is when Ohio State beat mg@n in 2006.
#7) love all kinds of music, especially since i work as a dj. love all movies, favorite is the godfather I an II, like III but its missing something. hobbies are playing sports, reading, watching sports, drawing, talking sports.

Inzaghi – Even when he was knocking them in I cringed with distaste.

#6- Favorite Juve moment?

Del Piero's free kick in Mialn vs Inter to seal one of our stolen Scudetti – pure magic. The first half of THAT CL Semi Final vs Madrid is still something to behold. I doubt I've ever seen ANY team completely school a great team like we did that night, especially the first 45 mins.

Least favorite Juve moment?

Apart from the scandal, the whole 2009/10 season. Completely depressing week after week – we were without spirit, hope or dignity.

Australia qualifying for the World Cup for the 1st time since 1974 in a penalty shootout vs Uruguay in 2005. YouTube it!

#3- How did you become a fan of your team? When did you start following them?

I was about 6-7 years old when i watched my first world cup in 1994, there was an amazing player wearing the legendary #10 for the squadra azzurra, he had this ponytail and it really caught my eye as a child, oh and lets not forget the skills that came with it. At that time, he was playing with Juve and thats how i fell in love with the bianconeri. My dad was also a big supporter of the azzurri so that was an influence for sure :)

#4- Who are your 3 favorite players of all time? Favorite player never to play for Juve? Who’s the best player of all time?

thats a tough question, i've been a hardcore football/soccer fan all my life and that's one tough question as top 3 is tough to do. Hmm…. well 1. Il divino Codino 2.Ronaldo O phenomeno 3. Totti/ADP/Ronaldinho/Maldini 4. lots of others. Favourite player to not play for Juve would be Ronaldo/Ronaldinho and Favourite player of all time would have to be Baggio for sure.

#5- Who’s your favorite current Juventus player? Favorite former Juventino? Least favorite Juventino of all time?

Bad question in these hard times, for sure our symbol and the most loved player by all of the tifosi, none other than the legendary DELBOY, Baggio as former and Nedved close second. Least favourite would be the @sshole Secco and about 90% of the post-calciopoli players.

#6- Favorite Juve moment? Least favorite Juve moment? Favorite sports moment of all time?

Too many favorite moments to name, lets say the game vs madrid in 2003, WHAT A GAME!!!. Least favorite would be Farsopoli and relegation to Serie B, the entire 2009 season except for the first 2 months or so.

What if Quags loses his form in later part of his Juve career just like Amauri did ? Then we wont be able to sell him for adecent value either.

Of course, both are very different players. Amauri is extremely one dimensional while Quags is a hard-working player who doesnt depend on crosses only.

My Brazilian friend said a lot of it is because many Brazilian players come from poverty, like Ronaldinho, and so they grew up playing street footy. They also don't have the work discipline, because their talent is what brought them to the top, not work ethic…particularly in a talent-loaded country like Brazil. So once they hit the top, win a few trophies, they find it harder to find the motivation to play great..or even stay in shape. It's a big generalization, of course, but there is some truth to it.

- Sissoko + Amauri + 15 or 20m for Hamsik, quite an improvement on the team. A quiet player, loyal (part of the reason why I would find it unlikely for us to sign him). Not old, Serie A experience

- Edin Dzeko 30m. Need I say more

- Jovetic 25m + a player. The guy is coming from a long injury so his price might be reduced. Same as Hamsik, he is quiet, he has great work ethic and will be loyal to our club.

In other words, is an 18 year old without Serie A experience with all the behaviour issues he has had worth more than Jovetic, Hamsik or Dzeko. NO WAY, NOT NOW, NOT IN A MILLION YEARS. If we buy him, I hope we do awesome and sell him in 2 years for 150m to Madrid or Man. City, before he gets complacent and becomes Amauri 2.0

____________________

Regarding the Quags vs. Amauri debate. The main issue that I have with Amauri is his huge salary. I think if we buy Quags his salary won't be 4m+. If Amauri's salary was 1m we wouldn't be having this conversation, he would be the player we put in to hold the ball for the las 5 minutes of a difficult game and who we will sell in 1, 2 or 3 years. Quags can stay, but I hope his contract is not 5 years with a salary of 4m, a 3 or 4 year contract with a 2m salary would be enough to convince me if he maintains this form until the end of the season",Jose ,"Nov 18, 2010 ", 3:05 AM,

Neymar Interested in Juve: Are We Returning the Favor?,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 17, 2010, 6:32pm PST",,"Reasons why I believe this will never happen;

1) Cost. Yes, perhaps the kid would be worth around €25m as Ivo says, but Chelsea are known to be interested. The price is going to more like the €40m Aaron suggests & surely if the club is going to invest that kind of sum it needs to be on a player who has proven his level is worth that kind of investment. Even a quick look on Wikipedia shows his goals have all come in the playground (Brazilian League/cup) & he has not scored in the tough games. Add in the obvious non-EU regulation which Marotta is determined not to waste the spot – look how he went back & forth with Krasic/Dzeko last summer.

2) His attitude. Everyone keeps commenting that “Delneri worked well with Cassano” needs to remember that Delneri had to throw Cassano out of the squad last season due to his attitude. Now both the Mister & Marotta have come out & said there is no way FantAntonio will be joining Juve for this very reason – Marotta cited the fragile nature of the group not needing that kind of distraction. With Cassano's contract seemingly about to be ripped up & there being no fee the two players would probably demand similar wages. If the management are not prepared to bring a proven talent they both admire to the club on a free transfer why the hell would they invest €40m to import a problem player?

1. Of course cost + the non-EU spot… That would obligate us to get Pazzini and seeing as he's playing now (without Cassano) doesn't make me all that eager to grab him.

2. Where are we going to play him ? As a second striker or as a winger ?
The latter would probably give a choice between Krasic-Neymar every game because I don't believe we can play both of them on the wings.
As a second striker he would have to compete with Quaglia and Alex, while he's really not that kind of player to me. He often opts for the dribble and creates chances merely for himself.

3. The last sentence brings me to his attitude. He is just not a Juve kind of player. Not in any way. His playing style, his motivation, his work-rate. The air he has around him looks typically Brazilian…
In one simple question: Do you really think he would fit in the group we have today ? Guess not…

4. We have other priorities, prima punta, at least one other winger (or Hamsik) and a rightback.",Robee ,"Nov 18, 2010 ", 7:20 AM,

Neymar Interested in Juve: Are We Returning the Favor?,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 17, 2010, 6:32pm PST",,"Let me just rebound your ideas with mine, with a closer view of Neymar:
1# On the bulk up side, Pato was also like 50kg when he got to Milan, that's just a matter of time.
2# Neymar is like a kid, he cries when someone takes his toys away from him. But he's only like that when his kid friends are around him. In Juve or even any other club, he'd be different because he wouldn't have a matress to fall on.
3# Can't say, but I really think that, if Andrea wants him, he'll get him. Another problem is: he ain't from Europe, so he would be the one transfer, instead of Djayko.

What I like about Neymar is his speed and technique. He's not a prima punta, not even near it, because of his paper-like weight. In Juventus, he would have to learn how to defend Ashton's flank, playing on the left. Altough, if he learns it, I can imagine an awesome player. Now my imagination made me smile :D

Bottom of line, buy him.",Daniels ,"Nov 18, 2010 ", 12:47 PM,

Neymar Interested in Juve: Are We Returning the Favor?,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 17, 2010, 6:32pm PST",,"I posted a comment with a link with some comments Delneri made about Cassano, but someone needs to approve it for it to show. I'll just cut and paste what Delneri says though.

Here are his comments on Cassano:

""I had my experience with Antonio last year and after that 'incident' [when Del Neri dropped him], our relationship improved a lot and we often hear from each other.

""He is an outstanding player where he makes the difference. Sure he is unpredictable in all senses and right now [at Juventus] we are establishing a philosophy that goes beyond football, a philosophy about the internal workings of the group and we don't want there to be anything that can break the spirit of the team.""

So basically, Delneri did in fact drop Cassano from the squad due to some incident between the two. Delneri at the time had always publicly said that it was a tactical change (which was the right thing to do to protect his players), but I had a strong feeling it was because of an argument or disagreement between the two.",Anthony ,"Nov 18, 2010 ", 7:05 PM,

2. Sell Manninger (5-7mill) Buffon will soon be back and once he does we have Storari.
3. Sell Grosso. (4-6mill).
Then we can make some sort of agreement with Santos on an amount for the future sale..
On his immature and egoistic mind: Del Neri knows how to handle those players, and i really thinks we need to look for players like Neymar for our team. he is top-class and wanted by the biggest teams in Europe – why would we not go for him aswell? Because we dont consider ourselves Scudetto potential? Europa League potential? We need to step up here and react when someone offers their services! When Neymar proclaims he lov juve and preferes to join us, he knows that he must adapt and listen to the coach.. And why would he not? he is only 19 years old! Lets say he joined Chelsea. how would they treat him? like a God? NO! he would be benched if he did not listen and learn – so shall he be in Juve, and it will make him understand that Juve is not a developing club, but that we have a plan to win CL within 5-6 years.
