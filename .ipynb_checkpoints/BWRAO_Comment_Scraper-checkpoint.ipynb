       "'I’d only take Pogba if the price is right, otherwise it’s pointless trying to sign a broken player who will be on a huge salary. I mean, seriously. Man Utd signed a world top 3 from us back then for 90m Euros, and that player has wasted 5 years of his career doing some 15m / season worth of ‘vacation’ there. Who the hell wants to pay 65m or more for that guy?\\nMaybe Real Madrid, but I don’t think they’re that desperate wrt their midfield that they will splash the cash to sign Pogba. They have Federico Valverde whom is growing up to be an amazing player for them, and they still have Kroos, Modric (old, I know), Isco, and James. If they’re signing a midfielder, that player would most probably be SMS, or even De Bruyne.\\nAt this rate, I much prefer we sign Tonali, or SMS if we indeed want to sign a well established world class Mezzala. Pogba is too much of a risk for 65m Euros.'"
