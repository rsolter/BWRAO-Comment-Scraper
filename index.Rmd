This website is designed to showcase a project done by Ravi Solter and Alexander Traczyk as a way to show off our skills in python, web scraping, and natural language processing. As we are both Juventus fans, and avid readers of the blog [Black & Whtie & Read All Over](https://www.blackwhitereadallover.com/), we chose to scrape and analyse comment data from the site. You can follow the links provided below to see different sections of the project.
