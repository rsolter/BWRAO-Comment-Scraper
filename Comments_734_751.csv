2. Nice sorensen and active grosso – nicely surprised.
3.Iaqui and Quaqs – a bit nervous upfront, need to calm a bit.
4.Nice AQUAMAn – man of the half.
5.Krasic – give him ice balls and we are ready (cavanda looked scared a lot in first 10 min)
6.We gave a lot of spaces till their goal came.
7.STORARI – flop of the half.That's why dear Marotta superman is priceless- we simply needed to keep up our lead 10 more min and we had to sore second but no…GIGI i need you ASAP, man a lot more games are coming like this and this mistake is human one but not with 33 years old keeper.

Matchpost: Bianconeri v. Biancocelesti,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 12, 2010, 10:38am PST",,"Great picture guys.

Thoughts on the first half:

We're playing a little bit haphazardly, but, and this is important, we are also displaying a level of comfort with the ball that at times reminds me of the great Juve teams that dominated their decades. This is a clear sign of the building confidence within the team, and I am very happy about it, whatever the score of this match.

One thing is certain: there will be more goals in this match. I will be very surprised if that doesn't happen.

Thoughts on individuals:

Sorensen: Very, very solid play, as comforting to watch as Grosso can be painful.

Melo: Doing what he needs to do, where he needs to do it.

Marchisio: Even more mobile than usual, and takes initiative too, something that was missing in his game for a while. Promise of getting into good form.

Krasic: looks a bit one-dimensional at times, but is a weapon any coach in any club of the world would love to have.

Quagliarella: just look at the ball control and sense of position the guy has when he feels good! Yeah, he missed a few shots and passes, but did you see the turns, the received passes, the comfort he now has with the ball and the team? Very good to see.

Ok the match is starting in a few, so I'll stop here.",juvealways ,"Dec 12, 2010 ", 5:45 PM,

Matchpost: Bianconeri v. Biancocelesti,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 12, 2010, 10:38am PST",,"Wow, wow, wow. What a game, Juve style, last minute win!!!. I was just watching the Barca game during the Juve game half time and I can't imagine why anyone would bother watching a league where most games finish with 4 goals difference when Barca and Madrid play.

Back to Serie A the championship is as competitive as it can be. Milan 6 points ahead of second place but followed by 2 teams that won't have midweek games and 1 that probably won't either (at this point I hope Napoli qualifies to the next EL round).

Some thoughts:

- Today it really showed that we need a prima punta, the Trezeguet sale seems more and more illogical. We would have been 3-1 at the end of the first half if we had El Roi. If we are going to challenge for the s… this year then we better get one soon, Krasic can't save us every game

- Sorensen didn't give Zarate any room to breath. Take your pick, Natalino or Sorensen? I think today it showed who has the brighter future. I say, send Rinaudo packing, extend Legrotaglie's contract and keep Sorensen as backup center back. That kid is one for the future. I think the polite thing to do would be for Sorensen to pay for Zarate's chiropractor visit, the Argentine is going to be hurting tomorrow.

-King Giorgio is a beast, and his understanding with Bonucci has grown so much, in 2 years time they are going to be an impenetrable wall

-Grosso sucked so much. His play is deteriorating by the day, Marchisio didn't shine today because he was super busy covering Grosso's mistakes.

- Melo and Aquilani played a solid game. Aquilani seemed a little bothered with his leg before he left, lets hope is nothing major.

- Krasic… he has been with Juve for 4 months and he embodies Juventus. If we lift any silverware this year it will be because of the Serb

- Iaquinta and Quagliarella didn't show much.

- The subs: Del Piero didn't do much besides getting sexually assaulted, his freekick was amazing but it has been a while since he has made a great difference. I think he is getting ready to leave. Pepe tried hard and did well for the time he was there.

- A word on the opponent: Lazio are a solid team, their defense is so tough, we tried every other way but they are very well organized tactically. I enjoyed the game thoroughly, if we had lost I would have said we deserved to win, but I still would have enjoyed the game.

- Against Chievo I would like to give Krasic and Aquilani a rest. We should be able to beat them with Pepe-Marchisio-Melo-Lanzaframe. Those two can be sitting on the bench in case we need extra help but they can use an extra week of holidays.",Jose ,"Dec 12, 2010 ", 7:02 PM,

I think he would settle right in at Turin. After all, he knows most of the guys from the azzurri and next to his undeniable giftedness, he is also a guy with humor.

I'd be fine with even playing with 2 seconda puntas then, Quags starting a bit wide left like he has been and Cassano roaming above Krasic. With Fabio, Cassano and Milos dribbling around their penalty areas, defenders would s*** their pants.

He'd probably get a 3-3,5 million/year deal.

I've never been a huge Fantantonio fan and I'm aware of the risks a possible move of his to Juve encompasses, he could after all ruin the great chemistry the players seem to have developed this season under GDN and we might suffer a second half of season meltdown.

Like Aaron mentioned though, Marotta and GDN know him very well and having the chance to play next to so many NT teammates/friends could prove to be the perfect combination for both Juve and Cassano.

With that said, as much as I think this is a risk that should be taken, I don't think Marotta is willing to offer Cassano a shelter a second time.",jorid22 ,"Dec 10, 2010 ", 6:13 PM,

Supposedly, Beppe Marotta revealed the news to Salvatore Bagni (an Italian calcio commentator/analyst) off air when they were both guests in another calcio-themed tv show and it was Bagni himself who let the news out.

Castro, who possesses both Spanish and German citizenships, is 23, a RB and has racked up 199 appearances with Bayer so far in his career. He featured 21 times with the Germany U21 squad and has 5 caps with the German NT so far.

156 Bundesliga appearances, 7 goals, 17 assists.

IMO:

This might all be a huge load of b.s but what's interesting is that one of the 'transfer insiders' who post on Vecchia Signora, had made his name over a month ago. He has been wrong before but he also hinted at GDN's and Pepe's arrivals in the Summer 2-3 weeks prior to them happening.

I'm not familiar with G.Castro but I've seen Beck in action and I like what I see, he's young, fairly versatile(unless I'm mistaken he can cover the left side decently if needed) and a well rounded defender.

Do we need a striker in January?,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 9, 2010, 2:28pm PST",,"I agree with what you said. There's a good chance that we can achieve a safe 3rd place finish with the guys we have up top now. It won't be a walk in the park but it's definitely doable as long as we don't have to face another ridiculous injury crisis.

If we do want to challenge for the S*******, we need someone else to cover up front. Three Four strikers are not enough, even just in terms of personnel numbers.

My suggestions are:

Rudnevs-I wasn't joking in the Lech-Juventus game thread when I said we should sign him and I say it now too. He wouldn't be a loan, more of a full purchase but buying a 22 year old worth 1-1,5 million who has a 0.5goals/games played ratio so far in his career would be a good risk to take. He seems pretty decent on all aspects (5'10, comfortable with both feet, nice movement, decent speed, good in the air). Worst case scenario, he flops, we sell him at 23-24 for at least a couple of mill, no harm done.

Marco Di Vaio-No need for descriptions, I'm sure everyone who's been watching Serie A for 5+ years knows that Di Vaio knows how to hit the back of the net. He's 34 but currently scoring at an impressive rate. Bologna is in a messy situation at the moment and I'm sure even a 1 million loan fee could maybe come into consideration by them. I'm not sure whether MDV would want to leave a club he's a key figure of in order to go to Juve though.

Crespo-Almost same situation with MDV in terms of age, current form and importance to his club. Not sure if possible.

Immobile-It might sound risky and as if Ciro's return wouldn't add much to the team in terms of S****** hopes but I've been saying we should bring him back for over a month now. The kid proved with the Primavera that he was talented and had a very good goalscoring ability and although he's barely been given any chances by Conte, he's already got 2 goals and 1 assist for the season. He's mostly on the bench at Siena and I'd rather have him on ours than there. He's also a bit more complete/ready for A than Libertazzi/Giannetti/Bianconi IMO.

TL;DR: Yes striker needed for S******* chase; Rudnevs, Di Vaio, Crespo, Immobile my suggestions.",jorid22 ,"Dec 9, 2010 ", 8:18 PM,
Do we need a striker in January?,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 9, 2010, 2:28pm PST",,"Well, of course we should get a striker. You said it best when you said “it could make the difference between 2nd and 1st place”, Aaron.

But as you also said… We shouldn't be spending any silly money on a transfer like that. We start from the 4th-spot-is-fine-attitude and there is a nice occassion we should pounce on it.

For instance Di Vaio on a 6-month loan would sound great to me… It was when he was at Juve that I really started following Juventus more and I always liked the guy. He has the grit of a Juve player and was mostly a sub then, but still arguably better than any of the PP's we're having right now.

Though Crespo is fine as well, I'd rather not have an Inter brat here…

I know Quags said a healthy return for Amauri would mean a new signing in itself but that's risking a lot on Amauri becoming healthy. We should base this question on what has happened so far.

Iaquinta has been injured on and off and so has Amauri.

We've had a healthy DP and Quags so far being able to pair up front. God forbid, anything happens to one of those two (Quags in particular), do you honestly see us still finishing in the top 4?

Imagine having to go 2-3 months with no one but Amauri/ Iaquinta or DP/ Iaquinta. I'm not trying to jinx us here but we can to be realistic given our history in the injuries department.

If Milan has clearly stated that they are in the market for a striker (with all the names they have!!!! OK yes some of them are injured but still), why shouldn't we be? They are simply showing their strong intention on winning this year as we should too (or finishing in the top 4).

In that order. Trez knows the club and he appears to have great relationship with Agnelli and Marotta. With that being said, if you were Hercules would you let him go? No way, Trez is the key to avoid relegation for them. Unless there is something in Trez's contract that will allow us to recall him if he wants.

Crespo and Di Vaio fit in the same category as Trez: will help us win the s… but their club won't let them leave.

I like the idea of Rudnevs if he comes for 1m.

The youngsters: no way will I bring Immobile unless Delneri promisses to make Immobile play every single Copa game and every game we are 3 goals or more over the opponent. Libertazzi seems to have a killer instinct but he is too young to create the difference we need.

He is the only stationary striker in Serie A. If you stand him right in front of goal, cross the ball perfectly to him, he finishes a clinical 20-30% of the time. You never have to worry about him being out of position. He is so committed, he always bulks up in the off season. And he is really good at sharing possession – with the other team. What's not to love?

Plus, I think he'll be available soon, whether it be his choice or Milan's. He's so humble, his understated playing style makes you forget he's a former world player of the year. And don't worry, the overinflated price tag will be covered by the jerseys you'll sell to the 12 year-olds who think he still is a world player of the year.

For the first 15 games, it is so open that while a top spot is within a shooting distance, it is also probable to miss the top four by a whisker.

We do improve a lot since our first game @Bari, but we can also argue that the attacking unit is now our weakest link. On our seconda punta, Quags is in top form but ADP cannot play well consistently day in and day out anymore.

Do we need a striker in January?,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 9, 2010, 2:28pm PST",,"The need for a decent prima punta is obvious. For me, regardless of our ambitions, we have presently only ONE consistently reliable striker, which is Quag. DP's form has taken a turn for the worse of late, which isn't surprising given how much he has played…still, his goals to games ratio remains commendable, especially for a man of his age. But as I have said many times before; what top team regularly starts a 36 year old in attack? By 'top team', I mean the real upper tier of european football where we aim to return as swiftly as possible…Consider Amauri a ghost. Iaquinta is injury prone, hard working and capable enough to likely score a a goal every 2-3 games, but not intelligent enough to score more regularly, or to make the kind of runs which are needed to break down the smaller clubs which close ranks against us. In terms of intelligent running off the ball, only Quags (again) seems quality.

To cement ourselves into the top four, we need a decent prima punta. Someone to challenge VinnyCenzo for the starting spot, to lead the line, sniff out goalscoring chances, and put them away more efficiently and more often than the Amauri corpse and VinnyCenzo. This would allow Quag to play in his more familiar SS role…although…will such a move mean his very impressive goalscoring rate will diminish?deployed deeper, further from goal…? Either way, 1 healthy striker in good form, 1 old man, capable of brilliance still but too often weak and flimsy and lacking any pace…and a battering ram with wonderful grinta, but not such wonderful feet. We need one more, and it makes sense to replace amauri.

As well as a prima punta, i would say only slightly less important, is to bring in an understudy or backup for aquiliani. So much of our play goes through that position now, that the players are becoming used to his presence…if he gets injured, who can play that regista role?? Marchiso is more combative than creative, as is Melo, as is Momo…Could we bring Ekdal back as his understudy?? Is the swede in any way suited to such a role? Do we have anyone in the primavera ranks who Delneri likes, who can play the role?

Prima Punta + Aqui backup…i will be happy. Adding in any substantial improvement to RB and LB would be a dream come true, as in my mind both Motta and to a lesser but still serious degree, Grosso, should not be in our squad…

I was wondering about one thing…cant we play both Pepe & Marchisio ?



How about this



Sorensen – Chiellini – Bonucci – Pepe

Krasic – Melo – Aquilani – Marchisio

Iaquinta – Quagliarella



Mind you, this is until Grygera/De Ceglie gets fit. Pepe cant be a worse defender than Grosso & he will add much more when he moves forward.

Podcast- School Daze: Lars Is Our Pepe,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 8, 2010, 1:12am PST",,"Great podcast guys, my coworkers are asking me why I am laughing so much, it is because it is great to hear people that know about football, so thanks, and thanks Lars for stepping up as well.

On the Lazio game I have a couple of things I wanted to comment. Lazio played a similar system as ours against Inter with a side that attacked lots (the right side with Zarate) and a side that defended more (with Mauri). Essentially similar to Krasic and Marchisio, even though the position and the type of play is significantly different.

I think Juve for that reason is very well equipped to deal with Lazio. If they attack us like Inter with Zarate on our right hand side I believe that Sorensen and Bonucci can deal with him, specially if he sit back. Floccari will be handled by King Giorgio and Mauri won't provide an attacking threat. If they switch and put Zarate on our left then he will have to go through Marchisio (in my opinion a tougher customer than Sorensen). This will give them the advantage of having Krasic marked by Mauri (or even double marked by their left back Radu).

The other thing that I wanted to point out is that Juve has been saying for months that we are aiming for 4th spot. I know Adam hates that saying with a passion because Juve is Juve and needs to win every game and win the championship every year but what about the psychological aspect of those statements?. Juve has been training peacefully and has been allowed to grow because by saying we want to finish 4th it took pressure off of us. Last year when Juve lost a game everyone was on our cases about the 3rd star on our jersey. Now, Juve ties a game and everyone is saying well, they are still in 3rd spot. I think a group of young players needs peace to grow and saying that Juve is aiming for 4th gives us that space we need to maybe challenge for the scudetto come May.

That brings me back to the Lazio game. We are playing in Rome, and for all intents and purposes Juve is playing for 4th spot (whether that is truly our objective or not, is unimportant). Lazio has been touted as the scudetto challenger and therefore they will be forced by their crowd and their own rhetoric to bring the game to us. This means that “Freddy” Sorensen can afford to sit back and that Juve can play on the counter attack which is how we thrive (see Milan game).

Our goal has to be to not get scored on and even then to maintain our shape. Melo and Marchisio will shackle Hernanes and Aquilani will have room to pull strings. If Quagliarella is coming back then Krasic can move forward, and viceversa. This will really put their defense in a lot of pressure. If we get a lead on the counter attack and I think we will be set. The pressure will get to them because “They are battling for the scudetto and we are not” (whatever that means). Forza Juve",Jose ,"Dec 8, 2010 ", 3:31 PM,

When you are in 3rd place & have the chance to take 2nd on Sunday, aiming for 4th is not so much about being overachievers so much as it is selling your team short. And even if it's coming from them, you guys are the fans, you are supposed to aim higher.

I kid you not, if you guys don't give Milan (who played disastrously today, BTW) a run for the Scudetto, I will be very angry. Everyone else knows Juve are more then capable this year. I think Adam has the right idea to just keep doing what you're doing & not watch what others are doing, but I also think that it should be open season on the word Scudetto from here on out. Playing for a CL spot is what Inter is probably hoping to do. The Scudetto belongs to real champions, and whether that's my team or yours will remain to be seen. But it doesn't belong to any eagles or wolves or any other teams. So claim it now, lest your tentative fandom cause your team to self destruct.

Podcast- School Daze: Lars Is Our Pepe,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 8, 2010, 1:12am PST",,"As I posted earlier MrsShankly it is a psychological line more than and actual goal. I don't think Marotta, Agnelli, and Delneri are aiming for 4th spot. However, saying we are does a few things:

1) Takes away pressure from the squad, if we tie, no big deal, if we loose no big deal and if we win great closer to that 4th spot. You can even see an evolution on that attitude, at the beginning of the season all we could talk about is 4th spot, now when we played Fiorentina we brought Pepe to help us get a result. I bet you if we are down 1 goal against Lazio on Saturday Delneri will throw everything he has at them.

2) We are a young squad, we need peace to develop. Last year when we dropped to 3rd the fans were burning the stadium. This year when we lost to Palermo, the team went to the Curva and said hi to them. This peace helps players like Bonucci, and Sorensen who are young and new players such as Krasic and Aquilani train in peace

3) Realistically, name by name we are not better than Inter and Milan. Inter hit the self destruct button when they brought in Benitez (we dodged that bullet). Milan is a team which has better players as such. Juventus draws its strength from the collective, from not being selfish like Robinho sometimes can be. We also have the strength of a manager that has been in Serie A for years. Allegri is a great coach, but Delneri has the means to motivate a squad to play above its means.

I for one am happy to not have the favourite tag on us, at least not now. Milan has the pressure to go and beat Brescia on Sunday or else Juve, Lazio, and Napoli will be 3 points behind them. Juve doesn't have that pressure, we are going to go and do our best and see what happens. I believe that is the best way to win the scudetto come May",Jose ,"Dec 9, 2010 ", 4:10 PM,

Podcast- School Daze: Lars Is Our Pepe,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 8, 2010, 1:12am PST",,"Excellent podcast, guys!

One comment I have about Pepe in the LB position is that he's not a naturally left footed player. His crossing suffers a lot as a result. When he plays on the right, his crosses are much better. At LM he manages to cut inside still and that ended up resulting in his goal against Catania. But in the LB position, he's not going to have those opportunities…he's just going to have to cross. So that will hurt his game.

He would do better at RB instead, but then like you guys mentioned, that won't really work if playing behind Krasic. He can still work at LB though, just don't expect his crossing to be perfect.",Anthony ,"Dec 10, 2010 ", 1:36 AM,

One of my fields is labor history, and I have come across many, many ignorant people (especially in America) who do not understand issues related to labor and make summary judgments based on prejudice and ill-informed political conservatism. While I'm quite aware of the various issues in labor organization, including corruption, massive bureaucracy, etc, labor unions represent a significant element of a democracy, and without them, I would question a country that calls itself democratic.

As far as this situation and the issues concerned, you have outlined them precisely, and supported your opinions well. Very well-done, kudos to you from a labor historian.

Just to make my position clear on one item: I do not think that strikes in general are “wrong.” They have been effective, if drastic measures in many, many labor disputes, and remain as one of the most significant tools in the arsenal of working people. In this case, however, I make an exception because of the destructive effects it will have on Italian football and Serie A in general.

Winter Transfer Preamble,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 6, 2010, 9:09am PST",,"I have mixed feelings on this winter transfer period. Delneri said that january reinforcement is a must (imo prima punta and a RB) but Beppe said there's a good chance we wouldn't invest heavily this winter.

It means no Maxi and Matri. Both are @10mil+. The only possibility left is Benzema on loan BUT ONLY IF Mou get his wish and RMadrid spend a fortune to get him another prima punta first.

Radu is injured so he's out of the question. Lazio is chasing the top four and scudetto is within reach so Lichsteiner will only leave if we spend big. So he is also out of the question. Again, the most probable is Ziegler, a LB, since he'll be out of contract by the end of the season and will be considerably cheaper.

So imo, the best case scenario is Benz on loan and Ziegler. In reality, we may have to be satisfied with only one of them.",dwicarta ,"Dec 6, 2010 ", 2:34 PM,

Winter Transfer Preamble,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 6, 2010, 9:09am PST",,"Juve don't have an option to sign Traore at the end of the season, Robee. So he is 99% leaving. And while De Ceglie was doing very well at LB, we need more than just him in that position. So Ziegler in January for cheap or in June for free sounds good to me. Also keep in mind that Ziegler plays LM as well (De Ceglie can play that position too). Bringing in Ziegler to rotate in the LM position is a good idea as well. Marchisio has done very well in that position, and Pepe has done well too. But a squad like Juve needs depth in all positions. Pepe is naturally a RM anyway. So Pepe could be backup for Krasic. Ziegler and Marchisio could rotate at LM. And of course Marchisio could step in for Aquilani when he needs rest or is suspended.

We'll have a lot of players that can play multiple positions. A versatile squad is a necessity now a days…especially when you consider the injuries the squad has had to deal with.

Regarding a striker, Marotta has said that Juve likely won't be making any big moves this January. But that's not because Marotta doesn't want to spend money (he'll spend if he believes its a good investment), it's because good players aren't going to be on the market mid-season.

If clubs don't want to pay the amounts of money they are paying right now for players they don't want anymore, clubs shouldn't offer those amounts of money in the first place. In the particular case of Juventus and Amauri/Grosso, Juve should have known better (I know, it was Secco, but still) and offer a salary Juve can live with. Now we can't sell them because smaller teams (which are the only ones willing to sign mediocre players like the two mentioned above) can't pay the same salary as Juve, thus Amauri/Grosso prefer to stay in Turin and “keep trying”. If those two players had lower salaries it would be easier to sell them.

I think Xavi doens't need an explanation. And Messi is not only good, but he is consistent (he is really good like 11 out of 12 months every year). He is still the goal leading scorer in la Liga if I'm not mistaken.

Again, the award is not about who won the world cup or who had the best first 6 months of the year, but an award to a whole year performance.

However, as galling as it is to pay out the nose for Amauri, an old saying comes to mind:
Tough Titty.
This is the fault of the team's negotiators. Can you really blame Amauri (or Grosso) for accepting a lucrative contract? It's much better to just pay a player what their worth based on an ACCURATE and levelheaded assessment of what they ARE worth. It doesn't seem like the club has much of a position at all: “We paid a lot of money for Amauri so he would perform. He didn't perform consistently, though he did try.” Just seems like a bad investment to me.

Football is the most popular sport in the world, so it is obvious that the quantum of money we are talking about is huge.

Winter Transfer Preamble,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 6, 2010, 9:09am PST",,"I agree about the players being greedy in part because they are drawing such a line in the sand on this particular issue. Taking a pay cut, transferring to another club, becoming a free agent & taking a buyout are all respectable things for a player to do who truly loves the club they play for and the sport itself. (When performance drops significantly.) I would like to see some flexibility on this. The lack thereof is what makes me call them bloodsuckers.

On the flip side, the players do have a short window to earn, they sacrifice a LOT to keep themselves fit, be available for the club, be in the public eye, move their families, etc. Even if it is a dream job for them, it deserves a different kind of compensation than most jobs. And the clubs keeping their end of the contract is important to the plan. So I do think they deserve to be respected. Freezing players out is despicable. I mean, sometimes watching players play who should be frozen out is bad, too, but I think it is very disrespectful to treat players like that who have been loyal and true to a club.

I'm mainly thinking of Serie A right now because of the strike, but it's true that globally, there needs to be some way to keep up w/the Reals and Man Cities of the world.

PotD: Sliding to Success in Sicily,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 3:14pm PST",,I thought Melo played a very strong game middle. When he keeps things simple he is worth the money we paid for him. He is showing confidence as evidenced by some crafty long and short passes. Sorrenson played very well tonight. His best performance yet. He made some nice passes and was composed on the ball. Pepe has looked exceptional. His position diversity is appealing coupled with his strong will and personality i think he is a must sign. He has many good years left in his leg. I feel very confident with Storari – but Buffon is the all time greatest goalie to play the game. He brings sexy back to that position with the improved personalities around him he will again shine. I hope Del Neri and our staff give Storari the respect he has commanded and we help him through the transition. I do not like the fact that we missed a few easy goals – it shows sloppiness on our behalf. The Del Piero Krasic failed attempt on an empty net is not the image i want to see. We have to show to the world that we have a killer instinct and we will put in goals no matter what Ie – Barcelona – Chelsea – Real Madrid. Overall a pretty shaky opening 20 minutes and i am beginning. I hope that is not a trend. We will need to become a better possessional team to really become elite but small steps. Nice win.

Yes Pepe scored a goal but probably Marchisio would have done that as well. Today our midfield played sloppy and I think playing Pepe had something to do with it.



With that being said, I am aware that the Marchisio-Aquilani-Melo-Krasic midfield is tried and tested while the Pepe-Aquilani-Melo-Krasic still needs a lot of work.



Now for next week, who do you think should play midfield: Marchisio-Aquilani-Melo-Krasic? or Pepe-Aquilani-Melo-Krasic?.

A- I think there's alot of Juve fans owe Fabio Quagliarella a big apology, I remember when juve signed this guy so many ppls hated on him and said he was crap!! I really feel Quags is the perfect n2 forward; he hardly ever puts a foot wrong in bild up play, has good speed along with great dribbling, he's a decent passer, his possitioning is awesome and can finish with both his head and that cannon of a right foot he has. Juve have missed him dearly in the Europa League. If we can get a good target type center forward(Dzeko) soon we will have a great duo up front for the next few years.



B) Marvelous Melo was a BOSS in midfield today



C) I'm really having a big problem with the passing coming from our backline, it's really starting to hurt us and needs to be adressed asap.

Delneri had a clear vision – to play a formation with wingers, and with two strikers. Players like Krasic, Quagliarella and, surprisingly, Pepe have thrived in such a formation, and obviously, Delneri deserves a lot of credit. He, along with Marotta, has done a fantastic job of rebuilding a team to fit a new formation.

However, why the need to bash Diego (or Giovinco)? If we had a coach who preferred playing a formation that had two creative players supporting a lethal, powerful striker, we could still have been very successful (imagine Giovinco and Diego supporting a Dzeko). My point is – we are playing very well now, and our formation is working. But that does not mean that the 4-4-2 is superior to a 4-3-2-1.

PotD: Sliding to Success in Sicily,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 3:14pm PST",,"Just an idea: Do you think inter's poor form is also due to the latest calciopoli 2 developments? I think that the key of inter success in the post farsopoli era was its personality (besides moratti destroying the rest of serie A teams, as I said before), that sense of union that made them overcome huge obstacles. I also think that part of that feeling was due to the hate against us, and the feeling they were actually being cheated before 2006.

After the latest phone calls were made public (showing that inter was also implicated in the scandal, and I think nobody can deny that), do you think they feel cheated again? but this time by their own club?

I know rafa is not mourinho (who is a great inspirer), and there's also the fact that they won a lot last season, so they lack the motivation now, plus the injuries, plus karma and all that stuff; but I don't know, I just like the idea of their players realizing they were fooled by moratti and the institution, and that they are not willing to go that extra mile anymore, not for a club that tricked them just as they tricked most of Italy.

I also reckon that most of the actual players were not at the team when farsopoli happenned, but that's one of those sentiments that you inherit when you move to a new team.

I for one was NOT dissing Diego. I was just stating that his SALE turned out well, not that Diego himself is not talented or whatever. I wouldn't have his jersey in my closet otherwise :)

Second… Sorensen over Motta was the predictable choice. Not because Motta was utterly shit in last weeks, but because of the system.

Delneri barely changes anything to it and with 2 out-and out wingers Sorensen was the logic choice.
Like Adam so clearly stated if Motta plays he goes forward more often and Melo drops back in between Chiellini and Bonucci to strengthen our defence. That's the moment where Marchisio takes Melo's place. Since that cover was difficult with Pepe on the wing it was the best choice to keep the RB at the back. And since it is in Sorensen's nature as a player… He was always bound to be playing yesterday.

And third… I like Grosso as a personality but his presence is really hurting us. I never thought I'd say it, but I'm craving to have De Ceglie back. He was in great shape when he got injured.

PotD: Sliding to Success in Sicily,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 3:14pm PST",,"Just a quick thing about the whole Diego issue as I just happened to read through the comments this morning and thought I would just add something to it. Look at Tottenham this year. They've often played VDVaart as a seconda punta with RoboCrouch as a prima-punta. They have brilliant wingers who, along with most of the team, often pump crosses to RoboCrouch to knock down to VDV. Result? VDV is the team's topscorer with RoboCrouch (I think, not sure) the leading assister (or at least one of the leading assisters).
My point: playing a seconda-punta who isn't a striker (i.e. VDV with Crouch and Diego with maybe Iaq/Amauri if the fool could actually do something useful for once/Djeeeeeeeeeeeko) isn't necessarily a disaster as long as the rest of the team is built properly to play the system. Right now Delneri has built the team to play a solid 4-4-2, the players are playing well with it, I have converted from a hmm-I'm-not-really-such-a-great-fan-of-Quagliarella-being-with-us-right-now to a Quagliarella-would-you-marry-me-even-though-you-have-that-creepy-ass-smile-of-yours-No-Homo.

PotD: Sliding to Success in Sicily,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 3:14pm PST",,"A few thoughts:

1. As bad as Aquilani played, and he misplaced passes all day long, do you know who made our 2nd goal/the tie-breaker goal/the deciding game-winning goal? Aquilani did. Canatia put 2 players on Krasic and that freed up Iaquinta on the right side of the penalty box, who received Aquilani's long ball and kept his cool and passed to Quags for our 2nd goal.

2. We did play better after Momo's in. GDN made a beautiful substitution to protect the lead/help the defense. Most of our chances after the subs came from successfully defensive counter attacks.

3. Juventini who bashed Diego's skills and importance to the club last season clearly haven't seen many of our last season's matches. While I myself am not his biggest fan, he was our only creative midfield player in the squad and one of the most, if not the most, influential players then.

PotD: Sliding to Success in Sicily,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 3:14pm PST",,"We'll never know what could have been with Diego. One thing I believe is certain is that Quagliarella better suits the 4-4-2 system. Quags has a better eye for goal. Diego is an assist man. He loves dropping deep to pick up the ball and pass, but we don't have a world class striker for him to pass to. So we needed someone with a more of an eye for goal…plus Quagliarella can play as a prima punta in a pinch (and he's done well in that role). Also, with the addition of Aquilani playing CM, a trequartista isn't really necessary. If Aquilani was a regista who played deeper, then yeah, there is the argument that a trequartista is still very useful. But Aquilani plays more box to box and would have occupied the same space as Diego I think.

As good as Diego is (and he is very good), he's not a seconda punta. His characteristics suit the 4-3-1-2 formation and little else. Delneri could have accommodated him in a 4-4-1-1 system, but why play Diego out of position and make him do things he's not used to? It's true that Del Piero and Quagliarella have also often dropped deep to pick up the ball when necessary, but that's only really when they're not getting the service from the midfield (and it usually happens when Aquilani isn't playing). And both are clinical strikers so that when they are playing closer to goal, they know how to score.

As good as Diego is, I think Marotta made the correct decision. And while I would love him to come back one day, that will only happen if Juve change their formation to one that suits Diego more (something I don't see happening). There's no reason to drastically change the formation to accommodate one player if all the other players you have better suit another formation.",Anthony ,"Dec 6, 2010 ", 9:37 PM,
PotD: Sliding to Success in Sicily,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 3:14pm PST",,"Agreed with all you said. I think if Juve had the right team surrounding Diego, then he would have done very well. Unfortunately, Secco bought a player for a system that Juve couldn't really play with the players they had. And Diego only really works in a 4-3-1-2 with two strikers in front of him (pacy strikers….not Amauri). The switch back to the 4-4-2 system was a smart one because it's a simpler formation that suited all the players at Juventus (other than Diego). Midfielders like Melo and Sissoko play much better in a four man midfield. And our fullbacks perform better when they have the support of wingers. And our forwards like Iaquinta and theoretically Amauri do better heading crosses in the box than they do running on to through balls.

So while a 4-3-2-1 system with Diego and Giovinco supporting a forward could have worked, the team we had in place was much more suited to a 4-4-2 other than Diego (which is why he was sold). Why try to change the system AGAIN? Its always best to build and improve on what you have, not make drastic changes. Thankfully Marotta saw all this and did what was necessary. Juve are better off for it.",Anthony ,"Dec 6, 2010 ", 9:13 PM,

at jorid, since you are being extremely rude. why dont i get amauri to get his big fuckin dick, and shove it down your mouth while you gargle on his human milkshake. you would like that wouldnt you?…what flavour would you like? you seem the type to like a good old banana in your mouth. why not try amauris? it makes sense

alternatively i can get amauri to get his 15 inch boulder of a penis, and ram it up the back of yo ass, whilst his saggy balls continuously slap your ass cheeks, as he goes at lighteneing speeds….im sure youll be pleasantly surprised. he does offer ultimate satisfaction…if this doesnt tickle your fancy, then i heard you had a teenage (which is what you are) crush on iaquinta, so you can look for that cheesy looking italian, undress him, pull down his pants, and find that old piece of chedder cheese which is stuck underneath his foreskin, pull it out and spread it on toast and eat it. ENJOY, let me know how things get on!

in the meantime dont get rude to the king of banta…(i'll let you ponder on my true identification) for my fans out there, you already know who i am. IM BACK",Agiamba loves amauri ,"Dec 5, 2010 ", 5:23 PM,

"Catania-Juventus: Bianconeri Away, but still a Home Game",The Offside Juventus,"Dec 5, 2010, 10:39am PST",,"This is the kind of games a team battling for the top spots needs to win. We played a horrible first half and yet we finished 2-1, the second half saw Delneri yelling at each and every single one of our players and we seemed more solid. Some thoughts on the game:

- Sorensen was very nervous at first, then he grew into the game. He is no fullback material but he will make a great CB in the near future. The guy is so big he is impossible to beat with strength. On top of that he has great positional sense so he is not beat in a counterattack.
- Bonucci did a good enough job.
- Chiellini was a beast. I told my brother who I was watching the game with that with the way Chiellini was playing there is no way they were going to score on us.
- Grosso. Did his job reasonably enough, but can't wait for PDC to be back.
- Melo did a great job recovering the ball and playing it around
- Aquilani did horrible. To be honest I think Sissoko was a better central midfielder than Aquilani
- Pepe. He is growing on me. Besides the goal he didn't do much.
- Quaglierella. Took his chances when he had them, he was the clinical striker we have been asking for, if only we had another striker like him

- I left Krasic and Iaquinta out for a reason. I think Catania came with the same ideas as Fiorentina, cover Aquilani and double mark Krasic. I wrote that Delneri better find a solution for that kind of a game and it appears he did. After 15 minutes he asked Krasic to move further back. This meant that the two people that were tracking Krasic were moving closer to the middle of the field and leaving a huge gap on the right wing. Iaquinta was asked to drift from the middle to the right wing in the space that Krasic's markers left. Result: 2 goals with Iaquinta setting them up. This also meant that Krasic had less impact on the game but oh well, we still won it.

I really liked the team spirit. I liked how Krasic sacrificed himself to give Iaquinta a tad more room to play almost as a winger.

- The other thing was how much we miss Marchisio. Pepe was no more effective attacking than Marchisio as I have said before he really makes Melo and Aquilani shine. Today we saw how Krasic and Pepe move too fast and don't give Aquilani enough time to look around. Marchisio gives that time and option for a back pass to Aquilani which Pepe and Melo don't provide.

- Now, let's keep the winning run, I really hope we don't play Lazio next week, but if we do, it is going to be a tough game, I am glad Marchisio is back, I also hope the best Aquilani comes out, that will be our chance to move to 2nd place. Delneri has to psych our players like before the Inter, Roma, and Milan games. Let's enjoy 3rd spot for one more week. Forza Juve",Jose ,"Dec 5, 2010 ", 6:55 PM,

Juventus Legends: Michelangelo Rampulla,The Offside Juventus,"Dec 3, 2010, 1:42pm PST",,"Listening to the podcast of this week (once again a great piece of work), I had one remark.

Adam said he would opt to buy Aquilani right now and not buy anyone anymore since we are out of the EL. Which I find understandble right now, since I do believe we have a time capable of fighting for the scudetto and certainly 2nd or 3rd place.

But then he added to that we'd only need one player next summer… To a certain degree he's right, since we 'll probably only have the funds to buy one top-class striker.
And that should make us serious title contenders if we aren't yet going to be that this year.

But… Really our team needs more. There are some complicated areas such as the left-mid or right-mid backup where Lanzafame is kind of a mysterie.

But my major concern is the second striker; Quagliarella is showing his worth but he needs a back-up next to Ale who'll become 37 next season… If Delneri is going to continue playing this way (with Marchisio on the left) we should bring in an attacker who can threathen from the left side as Ale used to do (and we were expecting Seba to)… Purely considering his playing skills there would be no better option than Cassano at the moment.

Add to that our right back who definitely needs improvement and some doubtful positions such as left-back and we're far from the finished product.

Even then other areas should be adressed such as CB; we need to reel in Sorenson and give a contract extension to Legrottaglie for sure.

All I'm saying is people shouldn't expect miracles this season or the next. We're on the right track, but we still need time.",Robee ,"Dec 4, 2010 ", 10:24 AM,

-Juve could offer Sissoko to Wolfsburg in January already with the intention of reaching an agreement on a price for Dzeko's move to Torino in June.
Real, who have been linked with ED9 especially after Higuain's injury, apparently don't want to offer more than 25 million and have turned to other names like Llorente and Hugo Almeida for their attack.

It's Tuttosport so I don't believe it for a second but damn, how sweet of a move that would be. 25-26 million + Sissoko sounds awesome to me.

Not that it is the most fairly given award in the world, but still, I bet inter fans are really pissed of. But as far as I understand, it “makes sense”.

That award is given for a calendar year performance (jan-dec), not a regular season (set-may… or july incluiding the worldcup), and Sneijder haven't done anything after the world cup. He has been in a really poor form. And even at the worldcup, he was overrated. His goals were meh and if I remember well at least one of them shouldn't have been given to him. I'm too lazy to look up for it, but my memory tells me he didin't have a great world cup (good, but not great).

It's true he was fundamental in the champions league and serie a victories (along with moratti's destruction of italian football a few seasons ago), but that was just half a year, not enough in my mind to make you an automatically winner.

Again, I know it is an award based on opinions, and justice is probably not one of the criteria, but still I can understand the reasoning behind ignoring sneijder (well, the above explanation and that he plays for the most undeservedly winner team in the history of football).",pablouv ,"Dec 5, 2010 ", 12:49 PM,

We NEED big guns up front. Dzeko is the perfect piece to our attack puzzle.

We will have Quaglia, who we are going to sign without a doubt, for next year in particular, there's no other seconda punta needed IMO.

And I'd like Pazzini…if and only if after Beppe has exhausted even the faintest of possibilities remaining of signing Dzeko.

“Are you following the trial in Naples?”

“Although marginally, yes I am following it. I've been in the calcio world for 30 years now and what is coming out of there are things that have always been common knowledge. Almost all teams did those things (call designators), what else is there to say? What is coming out is nothing new to me. I believe Juve was used as a scapegoat to pay for others' actions. Calciopoli comprised of a trial taking place in 1 month in order to punish the most important club in Italy; things were done quickly and 'half-assedly' in order to sufficiently address the 'bombastic' publishings the media was putting together (my note e.g: Moggi locking refs in locker rooms), someone had to pay for them. They made Juve pay because honestly, I don't want to come off as disrespectful here but if they would have chosen Lazio as the main culprit, it wouldn't have really pleased anybody except for maybe Roma fans. Instead, they chose to use a populist approach by making Juve pay for it all, which made the large number of anti-Juve Serie A followers in Italy very happy!”

I wanted to win that game and qualify too, it makes no sense for a club of our stature to want to get knocked out of a competition, no matter which one it is.

With that said though, although I'm not happy to have gotten knocked out and to not have been able to beat Lech or any other team in the group stages so far, after watching that game, I just don't feel hugely disappointed. Playing in those conditions was idiotic, the players and GDN seemed like they did care (although some of them didn't play well) and like others mentioned yesterday, coming out of there with no injuries was a miracle.

Am I happy about it? Hell no. Am I pissed about it? Not really.

For those who don't speak Italian, this is what Boniek says in that excerpt of his interview:

“Juventus benefited a lot thanks to Calciopoli: thanks to the trial it was able to get rid of numerous players with huge multi-million Euro contracts, rebuild the squad with new players, new directors and a new president.”

Apparently there is a rule that states at -15 the team doctors can ask to cancel the game.

-15!!! That is insane, I live in Edmonton, AB, Canada. Pretty far North, right now we are at -9 and you couldn't pay me enough to get out there and kick a ball for 5 minutes. -15 seems a little low to consider canceling a game. I would not want to get hit with a ball at full speed at -15 in the face. In my books it should be -5 or -2, but oh well, money matters I guess.",Jose ,"Dec 1, 2010 ", 3:50 PM,

'Although at first I was disappointed to learn that my newly-purchased Bugatti Veyron had been stolen and was nowhere to be found, I thank those responsible for it to this day, as their contribution allowed me to cut back on the huge maintenance and gas expenses it required.

With my new savings I was then able to lease a gently used Scion tC which I absolutely love.

Thanks to the fire they were able to get rid of the rats, termite-infested furniture and the mother-in-law. They were then able to rebuild their house with new pets and furniture”.

His view is that there's a silver-lining. His problem is that he's too callous about what was lost in addition to the chaff. He had personal issues with certain people in the organization and Calciopoli got rid of them, so he's happy… “Juve lost titles, was relegated for the first time in its history and was publicly humiliated? Meh. At least Moggi is gone.” That is his attitude.

I'm not defending him. I just want to make sure we hate him for the right reasons. ;-)",sposato_al_nemico ,"Dec 1, 2010 ", 3:26 PM,
Lech Poznan v. Juventus: At Least The Field's Heated,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 30, 2010, 7:59pm PST",,"Well put, I was merely having a go at the 'Let's all make fun of Boniek's idiocy' game lol. I understand his 'reasons' as he tried really hard to make it clear for the umpteenth time that he was not fond of Giraudo and Moggi multiple times in the interview (Devo dire che non avevo simpatia per la vecchia dirigenza, non per tutti e tre, ma per due sicuro. Non posso nascondere che mi davano fastidio certi atteggiamenti, di essere infallibili, superiori, che poi alla fine hanno messo la Juventus su una cattiva strada).

I love how he boldly states:

“Di calciopoli posso dire che si sa che c’è stato un periodo in cui le squadre non hanno rispettato il fair-play, quello che dovrebbe essere il gioco del calcio.”

only to nonchalantly admit a row later that “I don't follow the trial in Naples”. So Boniek knows for a fact that there were illicit actions by DG's, DS's etc prior to Calciopoli but he doesn't want to spend any time following the newest legal developments and proof emerging about the same issue in Napoli?

You'd think that a man who has spent the last ~30 years of his life as a direct figure of the Calcio world would be able to provide a bit more of an educated/insider's insight about a topic like Calciopoli than just what La Gazzetta dello Sport was publishing from April-August '06.

- Snow and the field sucked. We sucked more. The team wants to focus on the league and so we will.
- The worst part of this weather is that I didn't get to see Camillieri play an actual football match. I want to see the youngsters and I want them to get real playing time, not go out for a 90 minutes cross-country ski run.
- Sissoko should only play when the following players are injured: Melo, Marchisio, Aquilani, Giandonato, Tachinardi, Davids… you get the point. He lost so many balls, more than the number of balls he won. I understand he went through some horrible circumstances last year but he is not the player he was two years ago and that alone should be our measuring stick. Bring Marrone back or make Manuel Giandonato play the Copa matches. I am not saying those players would have make us win today but they could not have been worse than Sissoko. He is almost as frustrating as Amauri.
- Krasic is like a 4×4. He had amazing ball control for a player in such horrible terrain
- Traore was not impressive at all. Thanks Marotta for trying but I am glad we can ship him back at the end of the season.
- Lets be thankful there are no injuries. Now Catania it is, hopefully Iaquinta and Del Piero are too tired so we get to see some Libertazzi. Forza Juve",Jose ,"Dec 1, 2010 ", 7:27 PM,

I think these Europa League games have showed just how shallow our talent pool on the bench is. Without Aquilani and Quags we've struggled. With them I'm positive we would have at least beaten Lech once and Red Bull twice. But c'est la vie.

Regardless of how much the club wants to deny, it's obvious this season's goals were Serie A-centric, with getting back into the UCL the main objective. And so far we're on course to at least accomplish that.

Lastly, we really should look into signing Rudnevs. I mean, why the hell not? He's scored 4 against us in two games. Palermo snapped up Ilicic and Bacinovic after only seeing them play once (and looked how that's turned out for them). We've seen him play twice and his killed us both times. Worth the risk I say.

City got done away to Lech, whereas with a weaker team (on paper) we drew and by the reports I have read, should really have won the match. Our unbeaten run continues, which is now standing at?…10 games unbeaten in Serie A. 5 games unbeaten in europe. In such horrid conditions, lacking several key players, a 1-1 draw, with plenty of chances created, is fine by me. A shame…but I agree with the many, in that we ca now focus fully on the league, or rather, we can have a stronger chance of meeting our aims in the league. Without midweek games, other than the coppa, there is definitely less chance of injuries. To be fair, its obvious that the league is our major goal, else why the hell would del neri rest Melo?? our priorities are clear.



…Lets destroy catania this weekend, with Quag, Melo, Aquiliani all back in the starting lineup, as well as an indomitable performance from King Chiellini, who was not at his best last night.

Juventus coefficient depend on the club performance in the past 5 seasons as follow

2007/08 2.05

2008/09 16.28

2010/11 5.48





And as you know that we didn’t qualify to Europe for two seasons in the past 5 year because of Calciopoli48



Currently Juventus ranked 41 in Europe and that’s mean the Juve will be definitely in Pot three or four in Next two to three seasons if we qualify to CL and that will be very difficult start and it may cost us going out from Group stage for the third season in row.





Marrota: good job for buying two starting player that are ineligible for Europe (Fabio Quagliarella & Alberto Aquilani) and selling the eligible player (Diego)

Lech Poznan v. Juventus: At Least The Field's Heated,The Offside Juventus,"Nov 30, 2010, 7:59pm PST",,"IMO the sad thing about our exit from the Europa league is that it gives delneri one less platform on which to blood new players/rotate his squad … with the competition we were able to give our young players a chance to step up to the plate on the biggest stage, build confidence and gather experience …

as it is all we have left now is the league and coppa italia … with a squad of 26 players (excluding the odd primavera addition) delneri is more likely to have cases of players getting 'bum-rash' from time spent sitting on the bench and lack/shortage of reasonable game-time … ( with e.g. buffon scheduled to return in january and storari 'demoted' to coppa italia duties, what becomes of manninger? when grygera & deceglie are fit again, will sorensen and traore get enough opportunity to build on their impressive showings thus far?)

on the upside though, it's good this debacle was created before the winter transfer window opens, it gives marotta enough time to figure out who needs to be sold/sent out on loan/brought in on loan/bought in january….
delneri can also now FULLY focus his energies on putting up a VERY GOOD showing in the calcio, with less games to play than our direct title rivals (roma,milan & inter) our players can also gain the advantage of freshness in the title run-in…

as it stands (n with positive returns from our winter transfer actvity!) i think we have a good chance of sneaking-up on the bookmakers and being strong scudetto contenders….

Ok, we went out of Europe without honours and most of us are disappointed, but we did not lose as well.

You can NOT blame anyone for not including Brazzo, Grosso or Sorensen since they were supposed to be frozen out completely or unknown in Sorensen's case.

I also defend the purchases of Quagliarella since it was last-minute stuff (proven player already over Diego) and Aquilani, since there simply is not better player available in his position. Would you rather go through the group stages and not have these two ? Didn't think so either…

I am not against the decision buying Fabio Quagliarella & Alberto Aquilani, I was criticizing the way Marrota handled the transfer market. i.e if he wanted to sell Diago and buy Quagliarella & Alberto Aquilani he should have done that at the beginning of the market not to wait until both player will be cup tide. Or sense he know that both player are cup tide he need it to buy other players to cover.





And for you who say that we will qualify form the group stage no matter who is with us, this is typically fans thinking without looking at the big pictures, even if we said that, you do agree that a difficult group will effect on our league matches and on the other hand teams like Inter, Milan and roma will have much relaxed groups.



One more thing, if we qualify as 4 spot in the league this season we will play the CL 3rd qualifying, and base on our coefficient there is a chance that we will play against an English or Spanish or German teams on that round.

I'm not happy that things were all left to be completed the last day possible. 20,5 million for a player whose contract is expiring in 5 months is a bad piece of business. For the shit (minus ADP) that Juve has upfront though, Matri is a breath of fresh air and if we qualify for the C.L, I won't have a problem stomaching his fee.

Also, put more of the blame on the Elkanns and less on Marotta. He couldn't have offered a loan move to Garrone for Pazzini and I think it was clear that Samp would have given him hell in the negotiations had he offered 12-15 million cash.

When I was a kid, whenever we were going to go on a vacation, he would wait until the very last moment to buy our plane tickets/hotel reservations/etc and distress us all with the uncertainty of it.

His “reasoning” was always something like this: “If we wait for the last minute, we might find a better deal. Plus, we don't have the money to go on this vacation anyway, so maybe we just won't go.”

By the time we did go on vacation two things invariably would have happened:

1) My mother and I were nervous wrecks, being told “we're going” one second, “forget it” the other second; being told “that's a terrible place to go” and “we'll declare bankruptcy when we return” and things like this. Of course, we never declared bankruptcy and weren't even close to it at any moment.

2) The “deal” we got by waiting until the last moment always ended up being more expensive than having bought the tickets/reservations earlier, and we usually ended up in shittier hotels or with less perks, or in the basement rooms instead of the sea-view ones that were available had we acted sooner.

I am still hoping for a CL spot, a little for the money, but also because as we discover last summer, it is hard to attract top players without the lure of the CL.

As for the mercatto, wow, wow, wow. As I understand we paid 2.5 m for Matri with an option to buy him for 15 m come June. The 15m is a little pricey but not crazy high, but specially we get to decide in June whether we want him or not.

Most importantly Matri comes to replace Amauri. As a person I have nothing against him (like I do against Cristiano Ronaldo) but as a footballer he was horrible, watching him play made me want to switch to the golf channel. I think that sentiment was really hurting the team. Essentially with Quagliarella up front it seemed that all the hard work was going to pay off, so the players chose to work hard and we saw the results. After Quags got injured everyone felt dismayed, as in, no matter how hard we try, this guy is never going to put one in. I don't remember Del Piero ever yelling at Amauri to get into position because he knew Amauri doesn't have the skill, pace, tactical knowledge, etc. to ever do so.

Matri is a breath of fresh air. At least it will give our wingers hope that he can put one in the back of the net and they will see their efforts pay off. I think the team will start playing again with the believe that they can achieve something. This of course won't happen over night but it will rather take a few matches to occur but I think a different atmostphere will be sense in Vinovo from now on.

Lastly, I really liked Legrotaglie, he was not a superstar that forefeited money and glory to go down to Serie B but he could have gone many times and he chose to stay and prove his worth. He also was benched for no good reason last year and kept his mouth shut. Cannavaro should learn a thing or two from him. Grazie Nicola.",JoseR ,"Jan 31, 2011 ", 6:17 PM,

Podcast- Don't Mention The 'M' Word!,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 31, 2011, 11:22am PST",,"Ok people, here is my response to this podcast, please take it seriously, I am writing as openly, candidly as I possibly can, and I have no secret agendas or bad intentions. Listen well:

1) I am sick and tired of this purposefully pumped, artificial duality between the “real supporters” versus the “bandwagoner whiners.”

What were you thinking guys? Your definition of being supportive is in essence no different than any totalitarian regime's definition of patriotism, loyalty and consequently, treason.

Who gives you the mandate to define what kind of behavior is supportive, and how people who are being critical should just “get lost”? Who are you?

I have been a supported of Juventus since the early 80s, seen the worst and the best with this team, and I am tired of repeating my loyalty to the team every single time I'm going to criticize what's being done.

But the fact that I feel the need to say this stuff every time speaks for itself about the atmosphere you are responsible for creating, doesn't it?

You blame people for whining, bitching and moaning, disrupting the atmosphere surrounding the club, etc, but you are doing the exact same thing, only from a different angle, as intelligent people, can you not see this?

2) Adam keeps asking what purpose does criticizing the club serve. I will explain: it is naive to think that individual voices have any effect on a global behemoth of a community like Juventus; however, it is also naive to think that a cumulative expression of sentiments by supporters do not reach the hearts and minds of the club administration.

In this sense, a rising tide of criticism, not mindless, aimless panic, but criticism (you seem to equate panic and lack of loyalty with criticism, also a totalitarian strait that needs some honest introspection on your part) actually does serve a purpose.

If a person is in any way shape or form related to Juve's administration, it means several things, one of which is this: you are from the socioeconomic elite. More than likely, you have a supercar in your garage, a supermodel as your wife, and you spend little time in the activities and concerns that define the quotidian reality of an average Juventus supporter. Your reality is not the same as theirs. Unless a massive tide of discontent makes the anguish of supporters heard to you, you might not “get” the severity of the situation, even if you intellectually understand your responsibilities.

Hence, a concerted, mass effort of criticism serves to deliver these people a message they would otherwise not hear. They might still ignore it, but they will hear it.

3) Adam keeps talking about the current situation being the result of the faults of previous administrators, lack of money, long-term planning, etc. This is all conventional wisdom, and does not require some great insight or knowledge. Anyone who has been around this club for a few years knows these things, let alone old-timers like myself.

Why are you afraid to ask “why is there no money?” “is there really no money?” “is Exor the best and only choice for this club's well-being?”

Why are you parroting self-evident truths to squash criticism of the club?

This attitude, in its core, says “it is as it is because it was, and there's nothing you can do about it but wait, thing will get better.” You have even used some of these words.

What kind of defeatist and nihilistic message is this? Do you understand how social change works? The historical analogy of this is telling the George Washington not to fight for independence, to Martin Luther King not to bother fighting against the wrongs, to the 1968 generation not to worry about the totalitarian tendencies of modern society.

Just relax, everything will be fine, they will take care of everything. This is what you are saying. Think very carefully what your message implies.

WE, the people who believe that our criticism is there for a legitimate reason, and have all the knowledge about the club you have (if not more), believe that your attitude smells of “being more monarchist than the king.”

WE believe that you do not have the right to question our loyalty to Juve based on our criticisms, and we believe that our criticisms help the club more than your panicked, yes I said panicked, attempt to quell down what you erroneously perceive as our irrational, destructive behavior.

And finally, do not take my tone here as being too harsh; it is merely a rhetorical tool to garner attention in response to your self-righteous, ill-considered, superficial understanding of critical supporters, as displayed in this podcast.

Take a good, long look at yourselves, consider what I have said carefully, and never assume that you “know better” or have the right to question other people's loyalty to this club. You are better than this.",juvealways ,"Jan 31, 2011 ", 7:12 PM,

I mean, if in 21 games with cagliari he can score 11 goals, which is more than a 50% scoring ratio btw which is already amazing, then imagine what he could do for us with guys like krasic, martinez, adp, aquilani, marchisio, etc supporting him. I think he's gonna etter than pazzini even, and has been so far this season, with a worse team supporting him to boot. Also, I don't think we should sign drenthe cuz es urely left footed and that left side of ours should be reserved for de ceglie and marchisio/ martinez (depending on our formation, but either way I think both march and mart should be starting).

What we should have learn by now is that the season starts in September and ends in May, and the only results that actually matter will be know by May. You can get worried, you could even think we are going in the wrong direction, but nobody can actually state the season is a failure before the season ends.

I never thought we had a chance to win the scudetto this season, and I think most of the people here actually believed we could do it, and that's why they feel heartbroken right now.

You might not agree with the project the new management presented (rebuild the team, being the first objective to classify for the CL), but there's not much you (and I don't say “we” because I think it's the right thing to do) can do about it, specially given that the project have not failed yet (even if you think that failure is the only possible outcome in May).",pablouv ,"Jan 31, 2011 ", 9:25 PM,

Podcast- Don't Mention The 'M' Word!,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 31, 2011, 11:22am PST",,"Here are our important priorities for long-term (re)growth:

1. Slash wages and expenses.
2. Revitalize streams of income and club infrastructure.
3. Become sustainable and financially fair into the future.
4. Ensure there are two decent (not great, not even very good, but decent) players in every position, and have depth that can stand up to most injury crises.
5. Rely on wheeler-dealing, loans, options to buy, etc. to squeeze funds for #4.
6. Look for players with good attitudes, workmanlike spirit, grinta.

As far as I'm concerned, the club's management is only arguably failing #4, because a few transfer decisions have been 'questionable'. I'm thinking here of Motta, say, or Martinez (more for the fee than anything else), or the sale of Trezeguet. Because for the most part players like Bonucci, Krasic, Aquilani, Quagliarella… have proven to be good loans/buys.

I have issues with Delneri's stale 4-4-2, but I'm largely delighted with Agnelli, Marotta, etc. have done in the very short time they've had.

Buying big-name, world-class players shouldn't have been a priority this season, and it shouldn't be one over this summer either. The only player I really think we missed out on, who could have done us real good, was Dzeko.

Someone (probably Delneri) wanted a big target man/striker as a substitute. If it's someone with experience, even better. Then you get the chance to get Toni for free, and you think: “I might never actually sell Amauri, but I can't get rid of him for free withput a replacement, cuz we might eventually need a second prima punta (given that without Amauri, Iaqs is the only prima punta we would have, and he is injured most of te time). What if I get to loan Amauri, save his salary and replace it, FOR FREE, with Toni, who will earn like a third of the brazillian's salary?”.

I mean, of all the signings that Marotta has made, how many of them can we say have truly been a success (€12M for Martinez?)? That Luca Toni signing…still a huge “wtf” on that one. And Del Neri, should he not carry any blame for a lack of flexibility (sticking with the same old 4-4-2 when we don't have the players for it and other formations would be more suitable) which HAS cost us points and other tactical faux pas? Yes, the previous “triade” made big mistakes but that does not give the current administration a free pass. They have made their mistakes and should be held accountable for those.

And while myself and many others I am sure understand that the club has a bigger plan and doesn't want to just spend money wildly on names like some other clubs are currently doing (cough Chelsea cough Liverstool), surely it's only logical to expect that, being positioned to once again miss out on the biggest stage in club football for a second year running and lose out on that revenue again, that the powers that be would try to do something to mitigate that risk. The mitigating factor being spending to secure quality that could ensure that we finish in the Champs Lg places – which, if I am not mistaken, WAS the primary goal set by the current administration. Now I am not saying that with the squad we had that we could not do it, but it damn sure as hell was looking unlikely.

Lastly, personally I find it very condescending for you to insinuate – no, plainly state – that fans who vent their frustration and criticize the management are not true fans and are not helping anything. That's a load of bull. If you prefer to remain positive and support despite seeing the obvious glaring flaws from a tactical and business stand-point when more could be done, then go right ahead. But to make someone who does that sound like they're less than or fan or a glory-hunter or whatever term one may use is downright elitist and drives us further apart as fans of a common team. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but in this instance I have no qualms is saying that your opinion is wrong. I will always support Juve, but alas criticism also comes along with that.

Having a young squad with time on our side to develop a playing style and for players like Krasic, Aquilani, Bonnucci, Chiellini, Melo and Marchisio to become truly world class players. I'm quite excited about a potential Matri/Quagliarella partnership next season. As long as Quags maintains his pace, for the first time in too long we'll have two very quick strikers who can terrorise defenders with the only attribute you can't defend against – speed.

This June we should concentrate on a top-level full back and a Krasic equivalent on the left side of the midfield.

I shoot the ****, debate/argue with everybody on here and have crossed the line sometimes too. Although it might not seem like it at times, I don't actually dislike anybody on here for two simple reasons: 1) we are all Juventini in the end 2) this is the internet. I don't have a problem with or hold a grudge against even guys like Juve1 who I'm constantly going back and forth with. Fuck that shit.

I don't think you're less of a Juventino than I am and the day I arrive on my high horse spouting some shit like that around here, feel free to tell me to go fuck myself.

However, I absolutely can not stand fans who have a generally defeatist attitude, those who 30 minutes prior to the game's start are already commenting saying “we r going 2 loose for sure!!1”, those who insult the team, those who are like “hahaha we suck, i knew we were going to lose so i bet on the opponents!!!1”, those who after every loss feel the need to inform all other posters that they are contemplating substituting the allotted time of their day dedicated to game-watching with something of seemingly better value for them and those who cheer against the team under any circumstance.

Everybody gets frustrated after games like the one from yesterday and critiquing is the natural thing to do but that bullshit mentioned above is annoying to say the least. I believe Amauri was on his way out regardless because the fact that Marotta was willing to shop him around was pretty much common knowledge, don't think Sunday's loss really played that great of a role tbh. I'm happy with Beppe's work from yesterday although it all came a bit late.

The part about fans complaining about waking up isn't really a big deal, i wake up at 5am sometimes to catch the damn games and its on a Sunday and on top of that i'm a lazy bum so seeing your team lose 2-3 games in a row is a bit disappointing. No one is interested on how the time is going to be re-allocated but voicing one's disapproval at the performance and saying they regretted waking up isn't a big deal, its not like anyone was being offended.

But your right at the moment too it was foolish to be happy to lose and trust me.. trust meee iv never wanted juve to ever lose a game and although you think Amauri was on his way out even though he said he turned down offers to stay and you might be right i always respect your thoughts cause i admit you have better knowledge of whats going on with juve, i just felt that a loss before the last day of transfers wouldve made Marotta realize hes the boss and hustle that greasy piece of shit Amauri's ass and be like listen homie your outtt of hereee..lol

1. Attacking Unit
I think we all agree that we are elated we got Matri for only the 2nd half of Ariaudo now and some cash later AND got rid of Amauri without having to pay his salary for the rest of the season. Suddenly, we inject pace (lots of it) into our attacking unit. It went from abysmal (Amauri-Iaquinta-Toni) to decent (Matri-Iaquinta-Toni). It's still only average but a huge improvement nonetheless. That can only be good for us.

2. Defensive Unit
On the fullbacks, looks like we'll have to settle for hopefully-he's-healthy-for-the-rest-of-the-season Grygera on the right and pray-for-a-speedy-fully-back-to-fittness-level PDC on the left. Our defensive unit goes as their health and fitness level goes.

3. Midfield
This is our strong point and our best unit. But it has its own weaknesses:
a) We're doomed if Aquilani cannot play. Aside from him, there's absolutely nobody can provide creativity from the middle of the park.
b) The wings can help but we failed to land Drenthe and Krasic is exhausted and thanks to mediaset, serie a now has a new rule, the krasic treatment: Whenever a speedy player got fouled, look the other way and give the foul/the ball to the offender.

4. CL Qualification Chance
Milan and the merda are miles ahead of us in terms of quality and quantity so they will race for the scudetto. 3rd and 4th? We have to fight with Napoli, Roma, Lazio, Palermo and Udinese. We can only achieve that if:

a) Aquilani and Krasic play all the games and more importantly, get back into top form fast.
b) Pepe must always be healthy and ready when called upon to subs for them.
c) Martinez is slowly rounding into form and he MUST continue to. Better sooner than later.
d) Melo wouldn't have another brainfits for the rest of the season.

So, imo the fate of our reaching the top four rests on our midfield's form and fullback's fitness level. They go, we go. They stutter, we'll play in EL… again.",dwicarta ,"Feb 1, 2011 ", 5:56 AM,

I criticise Juve day in, day out, in my mind. I've loved this club through thick and thin and part of that means I want every decision the management team make to be perfect, and preferably done by tomorrow. In this search for perfection I will find flaws in everything, it's only natural. There have been many many mistakes made over the last 5 years and I'm sure this time next season we'll look back and realise we made some this season, but despite my criticisms, I think it is senseless at this point it time to simply lay into Juve and pre-maturely condemn Agnelli's plan as a failure.

When it comes to the crunch, Juve need stability for a few seasons and a 'sorting out' period – if that means we aren't successful this season, so be it. Personally, I'm not convinced by some of Marotta's work, but he'll do. Similarly, Del Neri's complete lack of tactical versatility is a flaw, but he'll do. The stability is more valuable than how well the job is done.

In terms of money, I hate money and I hate the idea of Juve throwing money on players. I know that in this modern world it would be stupid to think they you could build a top team without splashing out, but I'd like to see huge signings limited, and the funds used wisely.

I'm also a fairly new fan, so I like learning more about how the current situation relates to the history of the team and to Serie A in general. It's a good antidote to the complaining of fans who don't knwo the details (a point which I thought you guys addressed really well in this post. There is a difference between informed bitching and ignorant bitching!)

Alexis Sanchez plays in that little pocket b/w our left sided CB and our LB so hence having a right footed player on LB will cause Grygera to naturally drift more centrally to make stronger tackles with his better foot which would be good b/c he would be able to handle Sanchez better.

Melo won everything in midfield and combined well with Aquaman. Its not s coincidence that Aquilani is playing well with Melo back by his side. Even Krasic looks better than last 2-3 matches.

We have absolutely no physical presence in the box. Martinez has some neat little skills but is moving too wide at times while Alex is dropping too deep (Il Capitano we could make use of better free-kicks).

WE NEED LOTS OF SHOTS IN THIS WEATHER OTHERWISE I CAN'T SEE HOW WE WILL BREAK DEADLOCK.
Krasic need time to rest IMO, who looks tired and powerless against his opposition. GDN must risk a bit and surprise the Udine – i do realize he is pretty predictable coach. Alegri for example changed some systems from the very beginning and with great success, so why our lovely coach is playing as usual. We need some try to make it otherwise we will be the same predictable squad.

Udinese v. Juventus: Battle For Middle-Earth,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 30, 2011, 10:04am PST",,"I honestly dont think Del Neri is the coach for Juve. To be a coach of a big team, the one attribute you must possess is imagination and Del Neri clearly seems to lack it. He continues to stick with the same rigid 4-4-2 even when he doesnt have the personnel to play in it. He is not willing to take a risk or even change his tactics during a game when everything is going wrong. Doesnt he remind of someone else who was also heavily bashed for his rigidity? A certain Fabio Capello in the World Cup.

Being a Milan fan, I was clearly not happy with our start of our season. I was more furious at Allegri's continued insistence at using the 4-3-3 despite not having the players suited for it. Bit eventually he understood that and changed to a formation more suited for the team he possessed (4-3-1-2). Despite this, what I liked is that he has not rigidly stuck to it and tweaked the formation according to the situation at hand (we have played variants of 4-5-1, 4-4-2, 4-3-2-1 throughout this season). 4-3-1-2 still remains our default formation but what has impressed me is that he has been willing to change it if situation so requires. His problems with substitutions has also improved greatly over time. Even Leonardo who is not known for his tactical ability took the risk and shifted things around when Inter were loosing against Palermo yesterday (changing the formation from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3). Ranieri has also beeen known to do the same (hence his nickname 'The Tinkerman'). Other examples include (Jose Mourinho, Alex Ferguson, Carlo Ancelotti etc).

What I am trying to say is simple. Unless Del Neri is willing to shift things around a little (have some imagination) Juve would continue to suffer. I understand that a lot of it could come down to a lack of options but it is still possible to win if you make the right choices (our match against Catania for example, we finished with a LB, CB and a LW in midfield).

Lack of options may hinder a team, but it is possible to get a good result despite that. You just have to know when to make the right choices and adjustments. I hope for Juve's sake Del Neri realizes this and brings a little more imagination into the team. Hopefully Juve will get a striker by the end of the transfer window and goals will start flowing in soon.

Like it or not, Juve would have never been able to outscore Udinese if they played at their own game. This was a time to be smart and he blew it. Look at us, we finished the game against Catania with a defense consisting of Bonera, Oddo and Antonini. Albeit Catania are not at the same level as Udinese but when you are a man down and playing with three of your worst defenders it tends to even up the odds a little. The difference was that Allegri had them organised, not take any foolish risks and close out any attacks before it had the time to build up.

- We played the better 1st half and should have gone in 1-0
- Udinese started the 2nd much better and we scored against the run of play
- GDN messed up with his subs. I know there weren't many options, but the “black hole” should never be seen again
- I don't know what's up with Krasic but he seems uninterested and demotivated. He couldn't beat his man at all yesterday and I think he needs to vary his play more instead of just dropping his head and running. If it's fatigue , we should just rest him and play Pepe, Martinez or even Motta and RM for a while. If it's tactical and because his being man marked , it might be worth playing him as secunda punta because it seems like we are a man short in midfield at the moment. Our goal actually came when he moved into the middle.
- I think all of the goals we conceded since the start of the new year have been crosses into the box. It seems we watch the ball and not the man. GDN must sort this out.

Udinese v. Juventus: Battle For Middle-Earth,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 30, 2011, 10:04am PST",,"I thought man united had stuck to not just a constant 4-4-2, but more often than not a 4-4-2, and if not, then a 4-5-1, ALWAYS winth overlapping/supportive wingbacks, One very solid, one very creative midfielder in the middle, and two flying wingers???? And as a fan of the premiership for many years…since it began really. Man United have consistently been not just one of the most entertaining teams to watch, but one of the most victorious. Indeed, its fair to say that they got a little fotunate, with the crop of players who all came through around similar, overlapping periods/.///giggs/beckham/scholes/the fucking nevilles…the nevilles were not world class, but their grit and solidity was world class, especually when surrounded by some truly world class talent. Now other than this period, United have stuck with similar formations…as far as I can remember, ALWAYS played more often than not with flying wingers…They have bought well. Nt just from abroad, but from clubs in england, with players, who already looked wicked, but ferguson felt, he could make them world class…cantona, par example.

ferguson simply has a knack and talent for purchasing players who are at the very least, very solid, or likely to be very solid, in their role. He is a good manager, and great judge of a player. Luck has played its part, but when you look at the length of his tenure, no manager, or man, lives on luck alone for so long…I am unsure about del neri. The death of his father, mixed with the natural dip in form due to quag's injury, and melo's red card, and the parma defeat…seems to have taken away some of his ability to galvanise the squad, and give them serious belief, and a mutual desire to fight for each other…which i definitely saw, many times before christmas. Its absent, presently.

And as we have a squad, pretty similar to when we were doing well, i see this problem as mental, squad and club wise, rather than all the teams around us suddenly improving drastically. Pretty much where we were at when del neri joined us. But this time, at lest the recent taste of playing decent football, must linger in the mouth…and in which case, it makes things easier for del neri. a man whose upon which shoulders, literally rests everything.",thegutterpoet ,"Jan 31, 2011 ", 8:55 AM,

If we are that broke and have no money to invest, then why the hell were we so picky when it came to Cassano. When you don't have the money to invest, then you just take what is available and shut up. So imagine when what is available is one of Italy's greatest talents and for FREE!

Van Bommel might be the biggest asshole, but if he was available for free, why didn't Marotta grab him and sell Sissoko for some cash, as someone mentioned here last week. After all Van Bommel would have been just a backup for Melo, and the cash could have been used for Pazzini.

I really don't see how Marotta thinks and what kind of a building phase is this. When you are building you start seeing progress with time, in our case things are going backwards, or not progressing to say the least.

I run the risk of sounding cliche but I think we need to give this a little bit of time. I'm also angry that we won't be signing Dzeko or pazzo in the summer mercato (and secretly wish both flop miserably :) ) and the general feeling among some is to blame Marrota, GDN and Andrea for how the team is currently performing but i think we don't look at the guys behind the walls. Exxor has not invested in this club. Marrota is not splashing the cash because he wants to be stingy, neither do i think Andrea is preventing him from getting good players for good money. I think Juventus is not being invested in properly and enough money is not being made available. Its easy to look at Inter and Milan and Man City and Barcelona but these guys have people in their management that recognize that good players cost good money (except Milan sometimes, when Berlusconi just dishes out the money to show he's got it). Andrea has known the football world and knows that money needs to be spent on players but don't expect him or marrotta to show up one day telling the world that they're not getting enough money to buy players like coaches do in England. I'm just saying all these so we know which way to channel our anger. I've heard some call andrea, marrota and gdn incompetent but believe me these guys are doing their best. This is why i don't think they are to blame. At october, we already had a good team going; PDC was improving, Quags was scoring, Aquilani and Krasic were absolutely on fire. However long term injuries to Grugera, PDC and Martinez back then and now quags and iaquinta has meant the team has not had a constant complete starting line up since october. If our team from october had played on till now without being decimated by injuries, i don't think we'd be in this position now. SO its not GDN's fault that we have to play Motta cos since Grygera got innjured we have had at least five different people play at left back, or Grosso playing in right back or Amauri still being here.

The Search Continues...,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 28, 2011, 8:03am PST",,"i was thinking about our team and came to some interesting conclusions. Let me share it with you guys

—————————Juventus Squad—————————

Best in Class – Buffon
World Class – Chiellini, Krasic
Very Good – Melo, Aquilani, Storari, ADP currently
Good – PDC, Quags, (injured), Marchisio (since he is being played out of position, i believe he is a very good player)
Average – Pepe, Sorensen, Sissoko, Martinez, Iaq
Bidone – Motta, Grosso, Grygera,Toni
Alien Goo – Amauri
——————————————————————-

In formation-

——————-God
Average – V.Good-World Class – Bidone
World Class – V.Good – V.Good – Good
———-Good—Bidone/Average/Alien Goo

————————————————————————————————-

Depending upon the line up, we have at least 6-8 players in our team with quality. However, as it was apparent in the months leading up to the winter mercato, the remaining slots are filled by such ultra bidone that any serie A coach will target our obvious weakness and exploit it. Thus we get the feeling that inspite of having some decent talent on the pitch, we are losing games/points, simply because the players plugging the holes are catastrophically bad.

Lets see our prime movements in summer –

1.Caceres Out – Has backfired badly
2.Bonucci In – Good buy
3.Trez out – facepalm
4.Diego out – facepalm
5.Quags in – was turning out to be a great buy
6.Aquilani in – great buy
7.No PP to replace Trez – facepalm
8.Martinez – At 12 million, thats all
9.Motta – lol
10.Pepe – Decent Squad player
11.Rinaudo – “wanted posters in turin”
12.Traore – “wanted posters in turin”
13.Camo out – Decent decision
14. Giovinco out – lol
15.Krasic In – Good is an understatement

out of 15 decisions, Marotta has made at max 7 good calls, around 47%. Is this good enough for a Juventus DS?",Papai ,"Jan 28, 2011 ", 8:20 PM,

The Search Continues...,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 28, 2011, 8:03am PST",,"As a Juve fan, I am extremely upset by our current condition. But I reasonably have to refrain from blaming Marotta for all of our problems.

To begin with, I think Marotta is a good manager. Yes, he is not Moggi (yet), but he is much younger than Moggi and can learn alot. His experience at Sampdoria shows that he is a capable director who knows how to manage a professional team. Sampdoria flourished under his guidance (yes, it was his guidance – if you doubt that, just look at what's going on with the team right now) and he went as far as managing to take them to a champions league spot. Moreover, he was able to build a competitive team despite limited sources, which only confirms that he is not such a bad manager after all.

That being said, Marotta was given a very dysfunctional Juventus. Well, maybe not completely dysfunctional, but certainly a rebuilding side that is yet to find a proper model of development in the post-calciopoli era. The half-competent previous management wasted too much money on useless players, our balance sheets were scary, and in addition to all that we had no champions league money to flow.

I am not going to analyze Marotta's transfers. It was clearly against our will to sell Diego – and I still regret he did that. Martinez is yet to prove his worth, while Trezeguet would have done much better than any of the strikers we currently have. But, on the bright side, he brought the new blood so much needed by the team – Aquilani, Bonucci, Krasic, Quagliarella have all proved to be worthy (plus, as I mentioned, the hope is not lost for Martinez).

To sum it up, it is easy to criticize Marotta for everything, but it would be much fairer to look at what he has done objectively. We all dream of Moggi and his Juventus, but don't forget that Moggi was also the one who sold Henry, Vieri, and Baggio, who brought in Fabian O'Neill and Michele Paramatti.

In the end, my point is not to defend or accuse anyone. Marotta has been given a very tough job to bring us back to success. But the traces of the past mismanagement have not been erased and the process cannot be easy for anyone. Let's just wait and see.",NI85 ,"Jan 28, 2011 ", 11:01 PM,

First, Amuari will be gone, if not by the end of the month, surely by June, no more watching his horrible hair flop around, relaxed or not. Next, Krasic is on the team for years to come and we all see the talent, and creativness he adds on the flanks. It seems that Liverpool is going to sell us Aquilani at the end of year, at least I hope so (fingers crossed). Our back line is realitivley strong, especially in the middle,and also young. Buffon should have some great years left in him as goalies can go on well into their 30's and still be great. And perhaps the two most imporant things, the board is willing to spend what they can, and have the right players in mind to make the team great, and Del Neri seems to have the ability to coach players up; hell even De Ceglie looked like he belonged in the Seria A before he got hurt.

The Search Continues...,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 28, 2011, 8:03am PST",,"You missed Lanzafame deal, so his success % might drop a bit more.

Among the failed transfers – Rinaudo was always supposed to be a backup, so his form doesnt really count a lot. I dont think any of us thought Motta would be this abysmal. A lot of us thought that with Motta RB problems would have been fixed while left-back was a problem.

If I remember Juve did want Caceres on loan for one more season (I still dont think he is worth that much money) but at that time Barca didnt want to loan him again. Then towards end of the season they somehow buckled (did Caceres get any buyers ?). Either way when we got Motta eveyone thought he'd be starter at RB. I'd still want Caceres though.

Diego didnt fit GDN's formation you never know if it was GDN who pushed his sale. Anyway we got Quags instead so no complaints from me. Where we can blame Marotta is the amount for which Diego was sold. When Trez was sold Juve still had 2 PP and GDN wanted to show faith in Amauri. He turned around Melo so might have thought same about Amauri (alas how he underestimated the man-tree).

1, 3 (biggest mistake IMO), 13 I totally agree. Giovinco is still a dodgy decision for me. He does play in a formation which suits him more in Parma.

I was reasonably happy with his summer dealings but very dissapointed in winter mercato. I didnt want Legro to go away. He mentioned he wanted to retire at Juve and Sorensen could have been 3rd choice anyway. I am hoping Toni would get 5-8 goals which is still ok if we get rid of Amauri. Still I'd say I was very, very dissapointed with our winter mercato especially since Pazzini, Dzeko or Suarez like deals took place this winter (I know the non-EU rule but just saying).",Somnath_Sengupta ,"Jan 28, 2011 ", 11:32 PM,

The Search Continues...,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 28, 2011, 8:03am PST",,"Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli is considering making some changes in the summer. The team and coach Luigi Del Neri are underperforming and results are quite negative this season, even worst than last year.

This is what might happen in June :

1) Agnelli could recall former Juventus and Italy coach Marcello Lippi to work as chief executive alongside general manager Giuseppe Marotta. The 61-year-old would happily return to the club for the third time.

2) Lippi and Marotta, in accordance with Agnelli, would dismiss Luigi Del Neri and replace him with current Zenit St.Petersburg coach Luciano Spalletti, who has always been a close acquaintance of Lippi.

3) Former Juventus centre-back Fabio Cannavaro would return as Lippi's right-hand man. As recently reported, the current Al-Ahli Dubai captain has a contract with Juve which gives him the option of working in an executive capacity. Cannavaro would gladly agree to work with Lippi, their friendship and mutual admiration is well-known.

4) Once Lippi, Spalletti and Cannavaro take charge of the day-to-day duties, Agnelli would than start planning for the transfer market. The priority would be split into three plans :

A- Keep the more reliable players currently at Juventus. This means those who Lippi already knows very well : Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini, captain Alessandro Del Piero, Fabio Grosso, Vincenzo Iaquinta, Alberto Aquilani, Fabio Quagliarella, Simone Pepe, Claudio Marchisio, Andrea Barzagli, Leonardo Bonucci and Luca Toni in addition to Paolo De Ceglie, Milos Krasic, Frederik Sorensen and maybe Marco Motta.

B- Pursue some of the best Italian and foreign top footballers available to transfer in the summer. The potential summer targets suggested by Lippi and Spalletti would be Rubin Kazan centre-back Salvatore Bocchetti, AS Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi, Fiorentina striker Alberto Gilardino and Parma right-back Christian Zaccardo as well as Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.

C- Sell quality players who have failed to make an impact at Juventus. Their sale will generate part of the cash needed to invest in the summer market. It is expected that Amauri, Zdenek Grygera, Jorge Martinez, Felipe Melo and Mohammed Sissoko will be sold, while Hasan Salihamidzic will be released.

Time will tell what chairman Andrea Agnelli will decide at the end of the season, but changes will occur.

I think we can do better in our DM position – a very important position if Spaletti were to join us. I'd love to see one of these two formations next season (ignore specific players; the main point here is the formation based on players we have/can easily acquire)

4-2-3-1/4-4-2 (whichever way you want to look at it):

—————————————-Buffon
————-De Silvestri – Bonucci – Chiellini – De Ceglie
——————————-Palombo – Marchisio
—————————Krasic – DP/Quag – Giovinco
——————————————Matri

4-3-2-1 Christmas Tree:
—————————————-Buffon
————De Silvestri – Bonucci – Chiellini – De Ceglie
————————Aquilani – Palombo – Marchisio
———————————-Krasic – Giovinco
——————————————Matri

- I believe Palombo is Italy's best DM at the moment, respectable (unlike a certain man-child with a propensity for red cards), and in the mould of Antonio Conte.

- While the 4-3-2-1 formation won't lead to too many goals (due to the lone striker), it would dominate the midfield and be the formation to scrap some 'boring' 1-0 wins.

- Overall, I believe both these formations are very realistic and Scudetto-challenging.

- I'd prefer Deschamps (a very impressive track record) to Spalletti (just cannot forget that 7-1 loss), but the latter, at the very least, would provide us with some stability and some very beautiful football (if indeed we have Krasic and Giovinco on the flanks).

Milan and Inter spending during the summer is a given.

Napoli gonna spend if they reach CL.

Palermo and Lazio are also likely to spend in the summer while at the same time managing to keep hold of their best players. Plus rumours of Palermo being sold to a sheikh dont seem that far fetched…

Bottom line is: If you guys dont spend now, Juventus is seriously FUCKED for next season.

Oh and Del Neri really needs to be versatile and stop sticking with the same 4-4-2. The formation clearly doesnt work without Quagliarella and Krasic seems to have been found out by the opposition now, who are able to close him down easily.

Matri, given his contract situation, is an absolute must in terms of pursuing.
Papiss Cisse, if at a relatively low cost of <8 million or so would be a good idea as well.

Coppa Quarters: Man Down,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 27, 2011, 8:16am PST",,"Krasic is over-exhausted. But I still think an overworked Krasic can do wonders. The opposition cannot hold off Krasic for 90 minutes IF and only IF there is another threat on the pitch. Quagliarella used to be that threat, but I think someone on the left flank who's fast, left footed, good crosser and can get around 10 goals would SERIOUSLY terrify teams.

In the last ten Juve games, the opposition was playing a left back supported by a midfielder to deal with Krasic and the right back would tuck in to become sorta like a third centre-back to deal with whatever insignificant threat Marchisio/Pepe offered. Marchisio/Pepe are right-footed, so they have no choice but to check back on their favorite foot. Del Neri is great and all that, but last time I checked, 4-4-2 was designed so that the wingers could stretch the opposition's defense

Give me a player like Dzsudzak and one of three things will happen
A: The opposition double teams Dzsudzak and Krasic, and as a result, Aquilani has all the space in the world to score/create
B: The opposition plays with 10 men behind the ball, and chances are we draw, or grind out a win (losing is a possibility but a draw or a win for juve is more likely)
C: The opposition tries to play expressive and positive football against us (high line, fullbacks pushing forward and everything), and BAM Kami-Krasic returns to haunt the left backs of the Serie A. Only this time, he has Dzsudzak as his partner in crime.

And yeah Ive been reading a lot of the comments so far… and I gotta say

Juve's financial stability is great. But that's something ONLY Arsenal can brag about. They're financially stable (as much you can possibly be in the EPL) and YET they still compete on all fronts. Granted they haven't won anything in 5 years, but they're growing. And its not like Juve is bagging trophies either. Moreover even under their “financially responsible/youth project” they get thrashed ONLY by Barca, Chelsea and Man UTD. While the last few seasons we've been getting thrashed by Palermo,Napoli, Bari, Udinese, Parma, Bayern Munich, and Fulham. Hell this is JUVE, we're supposed to be Italy's number one club. Milan always had the European prestige, but its a sad sad era, if Juve gets knocked out of Europa League 2 seasons in a row. The same Juve that made an amazing 3 CL finals in a row but because they didn't win em all, IT WASN'T ENOUGH. Its a sad sad era, if Lech “Nobody” Poznan can come to Turin and come out with a draw. The same Turin where Real Madrid used to come to get slaughtered. Its a sad sad era, when Juve concedes against EVERY single team in the league (yes, that happened last season) and drops points against EVERY side, except relegation worthy Atlanta. Yes, my friends, most of you already know this, but Juve has indeed fallen.

But there is hope. Why? Because this is Juve. Juve is all Juve will ever need. Thats how we're built. Inter can speak of the recent glories and ignore their inferiority, Milan can claim Europe for themselves, Roma can remain second-best forever. Napoli, Lazio, Palermo can fantasize,dream and hope for a major trophy. But IERI, OGGI, DOMANI, SEMPRE Juve.

1. Too Many Holes.
The two winter acquisitions so far, Toni and Barzagli, came without the management spending any transfer money (Toni was free and Barzagli's fee will be deducted from the Diego's money Wolfsburg still owe us).

With last night's result, do the management still insist not to spend any money? With Quags and Toni out of actions, we have too many holes: both fullbacks, vice-Aquilani, seconda punta and prima punta. Do the management want to miss the CL when we open next season at our brand-new stadium?

2. Garrone vs Beppe: Eternal Enemy?
I don't know much about Piazon and only know that the press dub him the next Kaka. I get that he has to take care of the future. But loosing Pazzini (the merda Pazzo? THE MERDA??) and no words on Ziegler really depressed me. Is it just that we wouldn't spend or Garrone wouldn't want to hear from Beppe unless we double any Samp player's market price?

3. Opportunities are there, but…
And we haven't heard anything on Ziegler and Matri yet. Granted, they are good but not world class players but they provide significant upgrades to Grosso and Amauri respectively. Both of them will be free to leave their clubs this summer. The only sane thing to do is sell them now, even at a very discounted price. This is Beppe's kind of deal.

So, dear juventini, put the pink glasses aside and open your eyes and just see the good thing s on one side and the worst on the other. yes, we are exactly there! On the fucking border of mediocrity!!!
thanks to our books and Financial fairplay WE HAVE TEAM FIGHTING FOR NOTHING AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO WIN WITH POWER.NO MORE POWER AT JUVENTUS WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH EVERY TEAM WHICH IS POINT TO SHOW HOW BAD WE ARE AND NOT BECAUSE OF CIRO AND SECCO AND JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE PLAYS ON MANAGERS AND LEARN THE BUSSSINES ON OUR TEAM BACK.

We only lost one game, one puny game with Melo and Aquilani as our central midfield pairing. No need to say Melo got red carded in that game against Parma after only 17 minutes…

Now guess who's back this weekend and who will be well rested (besides Krasic and Marchisio to complete our midfield).

For all that everyone is saying about our competitors (for 3rd/4th spot) having a better attack… They do not have a midfield consisting of these kind of players.

If you ask me, Grygera as well had a pretty decent game against Vucinic and Menez yesterday. He should start as a right back at any time and De Ceglie is training again to give us the much needed depth and some decent crosses from the left side. He should be ready in about two weeks from now… The rest of our defence is not up for discussion. Chiellini, Bonucci are doing fine, while Buffon simply is in a class of his own.

For all we've been bashing Iaquinta in the first half of the season, he was instrumental in creating spaces for Aquilani, Krasic and Quagliarella. Let's just hope he can do the same with Alex and Martinez trying to fill Quaglia's shoes.

Really I hate the Delneri and Marotta bashing… It's easy to criticise during moments of difficulty. If they ain't got no resources there's no way we can bring in the likes of Pazzini, Matri or whoever rocks your boat… So be a man, stick up with it for now and the tide will turn (or at least I hope so).

Break Time for Aaron,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 26, 2011, 4:21pm PST",,"Tuttosport's headline: JUVE'S INJURY CARNIVAL SPREAD OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD!

Turin, 26 January 2011
Juventus cannot seem to catch a break. Buffon, PDC, Traore, Rinaudo, Grygera, Martinez, Iaquinta, Amauri have spent more time on the sidelines rather than on the field. Recently, they lost their top scorer Quags for the season and their winter addition Toni for four weeks.

It has now spread off the field. Their famous and one of the more respected blogger, Aaron Giambattista, has now joined the casualties. He will be sidelined for a few weeks or so.

Without a doubt, this latest casualty hit juve's fans the most. Along with Roberto, Aaron has provided in-depth knowledge and analysis of the bianconeri world. They co-host the most famous offside on the web, juventus.theoffside.com and regularly killed those merda over at inter.theoffside.com. Through ups and downs, he's been there for the team and for the fans. So what if Felipe Melo banned him from his twitter account. Most, if not all, fans side with Aaron.

Even though we at tuttosport don't always see eye to eye with him, we always value his opinion and positive criticism. We're gonna miss him and pray for his speedy recovery. We all hope he can come back soon. The bianconeri world is not the same without him and his contributions. He is a living legend.",dwicarta ,"Jan 27, 2011 ", 1:53 AM,

Momentum is a fragile thing that’s quite advantageous in work and play. With our team’s disastrous start to 2011, it’s safe to say that the team’s in the midst of trying to rebuild some of that momentum that served us so well late last year. With good performances against Catania in the Coppa, and a few bright spots against Bari and Sampdoria, Juventus will need to be at their best tonight against Roma in order to inject a much needed sense of belief in the players and fans alike.

Vincenzo Iaquinta has been declared fit for tomorrow’s game against Roma, and takes his place in the squad following a recent injury layoff. Del Neri named his 20 man selection after completing this afternoon’s final preparations in Vinovo, confirming that Gianluigi Buffon will be rested for the tie. The 20 selected are as follows:

2 Motta
3 Chiellini
4 Felipe Melo
5 Sissoko
6 Grosso
8 Marchisio
9 Iaquinta
10 Del Piero
11 Amauri
13 Manninger
14 Aquilani
19 Bonucci
21 Grygera
23 Pepe
25 Martinez
27 Krasic
30 Storari
31 Costantino
38 Libertazzi
43 Sorensen

No Barzagli yet, we’ll have to wait until Sunday against Udinese maybe to see what he’s about. Since Legrottaglie wasn’t called-up, you can be sure he’s on his way to either Brescia or Cesena by now. If Nicola wanted elsewhere in search of playing time, this move for Andrea at €300,000 until 2013 with another €600,000 based on sporting accomplishments works for me.

Also, as I’m sure most of you know already, Aaron will be taking some time off so I’m officially looking for a partner(s). My schedule is one that really fluctuates in terms of free-time from one week to the next so despite my best efforts to fill the rather large empty shoes Aaron leaves behind, I know I’ll need some help. So if any of you want to give it a go for a couple weeks, send your emails to juventus[at]theoffside[dot]com and I’ll get you set-up and teach you the ropes. No need to write an essay, just drop your name and a little about yourself and that’s that.",roberto ,"Jan 27, 2011 ", 1:00 PM,

I heard JCB did well with our finance and even after Secco spending ridiculous amounts on transfer fees and salaries we never went to a financial blackhole like Man.Untd so how come even after we cut so many high earning players we suddenly don;t have money now?? I thought it should have gone the other way.,Arunashamal ,"Jan 27, 2011 ", 12:37 PM,

Break Time for Aaron,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 26, 2011, 4:21pm PST",,"Well have a look at Milan or Inter's midfield, even Roma, they are not very different than us, We got Melo-Milan have, MvB, Inter- Cambiasso, Roma- De Rossi Napoli got Maggio.
We got Aquilani, Milan- Pirlo, Cassano, Inter- Snijder, Stankovic Roma- Menez Napoli- Hamsik.
We got Krasic, Milan – Robinho, Pato, Inter- Eto'o Roma- Vucinic
We got Chiellini and Bonucci Milan- Nesta, Silva, Inter- Ranocchia, Lucio, Roma – Juan, Mexes, Napoli- Cannavaro, Dossena, Santacroce,

Ok so these players are not in the same level as our players they might be better or worse, but not in a bigger margin. So if we ignore others because of awesomeness of our players…EL here we come. and yea. all those other teams has attack light years ahead of us.",Arunashamal ,"Jan 27, 2011 ", 12:52 PM,
Break Time for Aaron,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 26, 2011, 4:21pm PST",,"Can Bonucci and Chiellini do the job of 4 defenders? Cauz let's face it, your FB's are far from being decent. And Buffon is a GK, there are only so many saves he can make…..

Other than having a better attack, each of those seven have better FBs than Juve. So sure it's not only the attack that makes the difference but Attack and FB's go a long way in helping to achieve that. And it's not like that Juve's midfield is THAT superior to those seven.

I really think Juve went about this whole season the wrong way. They never needed a revolution or a complete overhaul of the team. The money spent could have been focused on a couple of good/WC players while at the same time not changing the team drastically. Sure depth is good, but not when it comes at the cost of quality….",Ash ,"Jan 27, 2011 ", 12:50 PM,
Break Time for Aaron,The Offside Juventus,"Jan 26, 2011, 4:21pm PST",,"No, we did need depth… and we saved money this summer if you count the sales and cut in salaries as well, sot there's no way you could've brought in world-class players for the same amount of money…

Btw. if you really look at the FBs of other teams… They're not that awesome as well..",Robee ,"Jan 27, 2011 ", 1:52 PM,
