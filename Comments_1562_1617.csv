Vooch was WIDE OPEN in the middle but the pass that Tevez sent was too weak and behind him. That would have been a great start.
We need to be a little more direct. We seem to get about 20 yards out and stop. Too many guys (Vidal and Vucinic especially) always look for that perfect defense splitting pass. That is why I like Lichsteiner. They need to keep feeding him the ball.
Pogba probably should have headed that Pirlo pass rather than letting it drop to his left foot.

Mirko was meh, looked tired.

Pirlo was nothing special apart from the pass to Vidal.

Gigi, Bonucci and Barzagli were their usual selves.
Chiellini making his best 2nd coming of Cannavaro impression. While his passing and technique have never been the best they seem to be letting him down more so lately, looking careless.

Pepe served Juve very well in a particular crucial time of its resurgence, but Juve has moved forward, improving and reaching new levels, over the past year-plus that Simone’s been sidelined with serious injury. Keep a roster spot for him out of respect, like Man U has done with its wounded warrior Fletcher, for as long as we can, but don’t get up hopes that even if he recovers fully, he will ever again be a significant piece of the Juve puzzle.

If he can’t play at the same level as he used to or stay match fit, he should be given another role if still valued by the club or be shown the door.

We realized early on that we could sell Quags and Matri. It wasn’t so surprising that up until the last minute, Quags was still up for sale. And we basically considered our options if we ended up selling Quags, and as it turned out, Gila was up for grabs too. As far as fifth striker go, Gila is not too bad, no? Especially if one extremely important condition was fulfilled: loan. We could offload Quags, get a not-too-shabby backup without spending capital, and next year we don’t need to deal with the situation where we have too many strikers again when Gabbiadini comes back.
It’s easy now to say which transfer worked out, and which didn’t. But can’t we admit that when a deal happened, it might have had a good reason behind it? You and everybody else can claim, “Oh, I was definitely sure Martinez would suck ass”, “I knew Motta would be deadweight”, etc. But did you remember that some people thought signing Pirlo was a dumb decision, that he couldn’t work in Conte’s 4-4-2, etc etc. Did you remember that some considered signing Vidal for 10m too expensive because he was on the last year of his contract? That we should have spent 12m for Verratti instead of relying on that French kid who came for free? Yeah, yeah, of course it’s not you (or you, or you, or you). My point is, hindsight is 20/20.
TL,DR: Look where we were 3 years ago. Look where we’re at. Acknowledge that all of them made some contributions: Conte, Agnelli, Marotta, Paratici, Pessotto, and even Grosso. Stop trying to attribute our success to one person and blame the other. I AM SICK OF HEARING CONTE IS GREAT, MAROTTA SHOULD BE SACKED.

About Quags, i think we should have sold him simply because we just dont need a 5th striker. I mean, i cant even remember when was the last time we really needed a toni, boriello, anelka, bendtner etc because everyone else was injured. So i think we would have been fine with 4 strikers. Gila deal might have made sense economically or even numerically, but then Quags is used to conte’s system. so there’s that.
and i know some folks who think that Conte personally blocked quags xfer just to piss off marotta, since marotta sold matri and giachh. when conte didnt want him to. god knows what really happened there.
Anyway, deal or no deal wrt quags and gila, one thing we can all agree upon is that it wouldnt have made any difference to our strikeforce.",calm-like-a-bomb! ,"Sep 13, 2013 ", 8:37 AM,

Last night’s match:
Montolivo is such a liability he makes Maggio look competent. Pirlo works his tail off to win a ball, Montolivo gives it away and good thing Kozak puts it into the seats. Once again he proved he has absolutely no business being out there. Nothing but backpasses and Brioschi from him.
Giaccherini, I miss our little cherub.
Juve will be just fine with Bonooch on the right. I just hope it is temporary. Ogbonna needs to earn our trust, I have faith he can play well as CB, but Boner’s passing is such an asset and only getting more lethal.
Balo might be 20 for 20 on rigori but I contend DiNatale would be much more effective up top, more clinical and not a cartellino giallo risk like 9 is. Hell, even El Sha is more clinical than Balo.
King Kong, he really is terrific in the air, my son was screaming when Cech came so far out. Maybe he is a keeper after all..
Kozak’s elbow on Pasqual, che brutto.
For anyone who saw the match on Rai, you know how they show those vignettes at halftime of various cites, towns and resplendent villas – they showed a villa and I could’ve sworn one of those paintings looked exactly like Bonucci, like he was a 16th century lord of the manor, we were laughing our asses off.",Tre Stelline ,"Sep 11, 2013 ", 7:01 AM,

On Gianluigi Buffon and the latest achievement in his already legendary career,Danny Penza,"Sep 9, 2013, 8:00am PDT",The influence of Gigi,"So yesterday both of my kids had matches at the same time, different towns. I help coach my daughter’s team so unfortunately had to miss my son’s match. He’s a striker but their starting keeper let in a flood of goals in the 1st half. The keeper asked out, the other one was ill and my son volunteered to play keeper in the 2nd half.
Apparently he put on a clinic. I arrived as the match was ending and the parents all stopped to tell me what an amazing job in did in goal, from what I gather he charged off his line and stopped three different breakaways and apparently made a diving upper 90 save that someone described as ‘Superman’-like because he used his fist to punch away. He also played almost as a sweeper keeper I’m told, and positioned his teammates on set pieces very effectively.
I asked him on the drive home where he learned to play keep like that, and he said “From watching Buffon. I tried to do what he would do.”
Problem is now he has a taste for it and everyone wants him to start in goal next week, his coach included. He wants to be the ‘next Giuseppe Rossi’ (in the sense of being US born but play as a striker in Serie A and gli Azzurri) but he wants another crack at keeper. I already told the coach he can practice with the other keepers this week and play 1 25 min half so I can see for myself how he does. For his development I’d rather him focus on what he’s best at, he’s still only 9 and average height, but yesterday might have been a turning point for him, I don’t know. But the impact/influence of Buffon is evident.
I told him he’s fortunate I’m Juventino and watches the matches with me, if I was a Romanista like he is (and my father) he would’ve played like Steklenburg or Goicochea, not Buffon!",Tre Stelline ,"Sep 9, 2013 ", 10:43 AM,

You can’t rate a goalkeeper based on highlights or one game they show on ESPN.

Same goes for other players, imo. When I see highlights of Garincha or Pele I’m amazed but I can’t honestly say if those players were better than Maradona. I can’t even say if Maradona was better than Messi, just because the game has significantly change since those days.
Buffon is one of the greatest. Only goalkeeper I watched who was near his levels was Schmeichel.
Cech had the talent and if not for that horrible incident I think he could have been there too. Casillas on the other hand was always a little bit less (still a great goalkeeper though).",Awarshy#8 ,"Sep 9, 2013 ", 12:57 AM,

I don’t understand, I mean we already have Marrone, who can fill up for more than a position, and we sent him on a comproprietra without any certainty of getting another midfielder; say the midfielder, Nainggolan, is coming for certain, he will only play as a midfielder and we wont have a vice-Bonucci, I gotta feeling that at best we might repeat the Giovinco story and have a hard time trying to minimize the lost of getting Nainggolan.
IMO the logical solution is giving Bouy a chance and see what he can do with the big boys if he done well then we might have the answer to the midfield depth problem, if not then we can still send him out come January and get another midfielder.",Linez ,"Sep 5, 2013 ", 6:57 AM,

It seems that wherever you look, someone knows better.

They look back over his two seasons under Antonio Conte at Juventus, and declare that in order for him to develop he should leave on loan, offering viable destinations like Fiorentina or Atalanta as places where he would thrive.
Yet many of these articles offer very little to back up their theory, outside of the fact that the 23 year old has ‘barely played’ since returning to Turin, and listing the midfielders ahead of him in what is steadily becoming the deepest squad the Bianconeri have had in at least a decade.

Name a “Top GM” that made shrewd purchases like Vidal, Barzagli, Pirlo and Pogba in the last few years without shelling out 20M+ figures. Like people said before, Martinez and to some extent Elia and Krasic didn’t live up to their price, but Quag, Matri, etc. are decent buys which contributed and are part of the success of this Juve team. Before this year and last bringing in big name players just wasn’t possible due to economic and simply because “we were not there yet” circumstances. The team was rebuilding on the pitch and off the pitch while trying to bring its name back to former glory.
Also you are giving Marotta full responsibility over every transfer while the success and failure of a transfer is a collective effort from the management and coaching staff. Marotta doesn’t just decide, “HEY I’m getting this guy!”, a player can be singly requested or thye can be looking at players of certain characteristics. Some of the purchases people hate aren’t what I would call “Marotta buys”.

It’s a very nifty balance because at the end of the day we have Tevez-Vucinic and you can win with them. On the other side the is no other important option, even is we spent 90 milion for offensive players (and I’m not counting the young players we have on loan and stuff like that).

Elia and Martinez were failures, but even Moggi bought players like Appiah, Zebina, Guzman, etc. Nobody’s perfect.
Quagliarella, Matri, and Giovinco were needed at that time. You can’t expect a team that’s rebuilding to buy every best players in the world. Marotta had to make do with the limited money when he had to add quantity to the team.
I just think that Marotta did an outstanding job so far, but a better one is needed if we want to take a next step forward.
Now, can you give me a name for this “better one”?
The fact remains that Marotta (along with Agnelli, Paratici, Conte, etc.) has been able to rebuild Juventus into one of the best team in Europe with limited funds. And remember that we were on a downward spiral when the new management took over.",Refly ,"Sep 6, 2013 ", 5:17 AM,

Look , after the Del Neri disaster Marotta wanted Mazzari. Agnelli instead went all on his own and brought Conte. Days later Conte says he wants to play a 4-2-4 system and tells Marotta to sell Krasic and keep Pepe (who has being sold in Russia). Marotta refuses to sell the serbian and brings in Elia which Conte does not want. He instead wants Giaccherini and manages to keep Pepe.
This is not he said-she said type of situation. This is a situation where a coach tells the GM who wanted another coach that 2 guys are not good enough and don’t fit his system (that Krasic guy, after 1 year in Italy wasn’t speaking a gram of italian).
You saw that happened… Elia had 5 games, Krasic 10. Other Bozzo players like Ziegler and Motta where out from the get go. Grosso played 1 game against Siena because De Ceglie got send off in the Parma 4-1 win and there where no other options.
Conte has the winning ingredient of winning and the Juventus Style is a big part of it. He just doesn’t think Marotta has it. Knew it from the get go and there is no turning back.

Conte wants to play 4-2-4 so we should sell the players that are able to play in that system? What does “manages to keep Pepe” mean? Pepe had deals flowing in from European giants which gave Marotta a twinkle in his evil eye but Conte PLEAD to Marotta not to sell him, thankfully managing to keep him. Please, come on.
This is not he said-she said type of situation.
You’re right here, its a you said-you believe situation as in you assume some wild claim, you say it and you believe it. All of these are assumptions, and WILD ones at that. Its like your very own Juve soap opera you watch while wearing a tinfoil hat.
Shift in games played by Elia and Krasic is because the system changed and they either weren’t able to adapt or just sucked.
He just doesn’t think Marotta has it. Knew it from the get go and there is no turning back.

2) That performance-salary correlation has already been factored in, even now. It’s called performance bonus, a significant factor in Juventus reward scheme.
3) 4m/yr for 20 years old who has yet to achieve anything to show off. Sure he’s got potential, but the only way to realize that potential is to keep his head on his shoulder and his feet on the ground. Paying him 4m/yr is not the best way to motivate the boy.
4) Vidal has proven himself to be the most consistent performer over the past 2 years. Pogba has just raised through the rank, and has less than one full year of first team performance. If we’re paying 4m for Pogba now, I have serious concern about our future.
5) Look at Bayern, the top club in the world of football right now, and tell me how much they spend on total salary. Look at ours. If you think the only way to reach the top tier is to merely pay top dollars, then I fear we have no way to agree on this.

doesnt matter. if he deserves it then he should get it. and look, this figure is from Mina, so obviously it wont simply happen just like that. a middle ground will be found.

3) i dont think he is motivated by money; i think he is motivated by success. but there is no reason why he should be underpaid.4 m might be too much but if Isco is getting 2, then pogba deserves to be at par or even higher.

His athleticism is impressive enough as is his pace, and perhaps once or twice a game he can put in a decent curling cross. However, he has zero defensive intelligence, is clueless positionally, tackles like a centre forward and finds it always tricky ifnot impossible to pass the ball in a straight line (his left boot seems more like a hook)…In terms of a LWB or LB he has made me miss Molinaro plenty of times. Whilst poor old Christian could not cross or pass over a longer range than 5-10 metres, he could tackle, cover, head. You know…he had the basics of a defender. The De Ceglie has had so many chances, proven himself inept over and over again and it has been of no surprise, a god-send really that in the last two seasons we have bought in 2 players for the LWB position…well three if you include Padoin (who can play there). I feel sorry for the lad, and wish him well in a different career, but he has never been and will never be my idea of a professional footballer. A runner and hooker of the ball…brilliant!

I agree completely than Conte is happy with our starting LWB, in fact I think he has every reason to be happy with every part of our starting team, for its ever so strong these days. We are truly returning to a position of domestic powerhouse and respected, dangerous opponent in Europe. Its of major importance for us to continue our momentum of last season’s successful champions league campaign. Our group wil be testing, and like everyone else I can’t wait to see us face off against Real.
Domestically, I have a feeling we may see stronger and a greater number of challengers for the top spot, yet whilst others may equal our attacking prowess I see no other team who comes close to us defensively, nor outdoes us in midfield.
Back to the rumours you mentioned…the Zuniga story, which seems to have has serious substance and is still smoking, suggests that Conte wanted strong competition with Asamoah for the LWB slot. The same can be said of Kolarov, to a degree, but the interest in the Serbian gives me a hint that Conte likes the idea of having more depth on the flanks, not just defensively, but potentially further forward. With pepe back in the running, will we see the 4-3-3 trialled? I guess I have never enjoyed Kolarov defensively, although found him potent higher up the wing.
What do you think, mate…of the Zuniga/ Kolarov pursuit? Merely more options The potential to free up Asamoah to return to his more natural dynamic CM role??
And then the strangeness with Isla…had Inter offered more money, would we have let him go?? Or was it somehow tied to the Zuniga/Kolarov efforts?? I am likely not alone in hoping that the Chilean is given another chance, as seems possible given his recent run-out as a sub in the league.
With the midfield and defence so solid, and the attack really seeming a case of Who PartnerS tevez?? How Can We Get Llorente Back to His Best? With mirko currently proving the preferred choice…Its the flanks which interest me the most.
I have seen Caceres play as a marauding fullback on both flanks. Yet what is his role in our squad?? Understudy to Barzagli? Understudy to Asamoah he seems so talented a player, always solid, perhaps lacking the passing and movement which Conte demands of his first XI??

Marc-Oliver Kempf's agent says why the player rejected Juventus this summer,Danny Penza,"Sep 4, 2013, 2:15am PDT","Well, let's see...","I think Zuniga is a Conte type player for the wingback position. Strong physically, more defensive than offensive, he could also play both wings, so that’s a plus. But I don’t see how he would add quality into the starting XI. He’s a better depth player than Padoin or PDC, and that’s pretty much it. If he joins for free next summer, I’m happy. But I hope we don’t sign him in January. I can see why we want him, though.
Kolarov, I’m not convinced. I personally don’t want him, because I don’t think Conte likes him. Conte always prefer solid defensive capability above offensive potential for his wingbacks, and that’s exactly the opposite for Kolarov. Also, he’s a Citizen; I imagine fee and salary to be quite high. I don’t believe Conte really ever want him. Oh, please be mindful that when I say Conte, I mean Conte+Marotta, because I do believe they work together. And vice versa, of course. Unless otherwise specified by the context. You know what I mean.
Even if any of these 2 comes, I’d expect Asamoah to remain the first choice for LWB. Oh, I do think we’re not chasing Coentrao because he’s a) expensive (salary+transfer fee) and b) seen by Conte as more offensive than defensive. But I tend to disagree. From what little I see of Coentrao, he seems good enough defensively.
Isla, IMO, is rather “weak” in terms of mental strength. He’s not patient enough, not hardworking enough, I dunno. One thing’s for sure, there’s something in him that caused Conte to backtrack, from “very interested” when we signed him, to “not overly concerned even if we sell him at a loss to our rival who is in urgent need of him”. Consider also that he wants to move after having difficulty in finding regular playing time with Juve, and you see where I’m coming from when I say he’s mentally “weak”.
If I were a journalist, I’d surely write an article saying that Isla-Inter negotiation is intentionally started/fueled by Marotta in order to make Inter less concentrated on their pursuit of Zuniga. But I don’t think Marotta can play this game. Also, I do believe that if we had gotten Zuniga, Isla’s 50% would have been sold to Inter for a fee in the region of 7m. A loss of 2.4 mil after one season for 50% ownership, eq. to 4.8mil amortization for the full ownership, meaning if we sign him for 5 years, that translates to 24mil transfer fee. That kind of figure makes you wonder how bad did Isla do in his first year…
As I don’t believe we’re ever seriously interested in Kolarov, I also don’t believe Kolarov coming = Isla going. Oh, I didn’t mention this above, but I do believe that Marotta would sign Kolarov, but only on loan, while waiting for his chance to pounce on a quality left back. You know, the Borriello-Bendtner-Anelka-Llorente way.
Llorente will be useful, more than the media suggests right now. But I’m guessing he’ll only start to feature regularly starting in Nov-Jan. I’ve already explained that for Conte, it’s too risky to start a strike partnership who’s a) never played together before, b) never played in Serie A before, and c) never played in his system before. When you also consider that Llorente didn’t play as much in the last season, you have to understand why Conte prefers Tevez-Vucinic partnership for now. In any case, the 3 of them have vastly different characteristics, and will all serve their purpose.
To add, I think Vucinic is special in our strikeforce, because IMO he’s the only one capable of forming a working partnership with any of our other strikers. I don’t think Tevez-Giovinco or Quags-Giovinco or Llorente-Quags would work.
Caceres is an enigma. I’m as baffled as anyone here as to why he’s not getting more game time. I like his attitude, never complains, never stirring up things when he doesn’t play. But I wonder how long will he keep it up. If Conte really see Ogbonna as the first replacement for Barzagli this season, then I think Caceres will start to see what his other options are… I certainly don’t think Conte sees him as a wingback. Which baffles me. Again and again.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 6, 2013 ", 7:08 AM,

The most interesting point you raised was that of Conte’s logical reluctance to deploy a partnership which lack a seasoned Serie A campaigner. I agree with the suggestion that we will probably not see much of Llorente, especially in terms of starting games, until a few months deeper into the season.
Vucinic is in decent form so far, and long may it continue, for despite his normal lethargy for large portions of games so far, he has managed to produce something valuable each outing. We may as well continue with the Mirko/Carlos tandem, but I hope we can give the Spaniard a large chunk of playing time against Verona in a week or two, could be just what he needs to start finding his feet.",thegutterpoet ,"Sep 6, 2013 ", 7:15 PM,

I’ve mentioned before that I became a Juventino during the ’82 World Cup, and started watching Juve in earnest the following fall. I was 11 and even though that ’82-83 team had Platini, Boniek, Azzurri heroes Rossi and Tardelli, my favorite player quickly became Sergio Brio – I played center half and he was everything I thought a defender should be, tough and physical.
One Saturday that season I was playing and my father and Nonno were there. My Nonno looked like an Italian David Brinkley (the ABC journalist), always wore a coat and tie, shoes shined, and he taught me Lo Stile Juve. He would stand on the sidelines watching me, arms crossed, like he was Enzo Bearzot minus the pipe.
Anyway one time I made a slide tackle (the way I thought Brio would) on their star player on a breakaway and actually really hurt him – think Paolo Montero vs Martins of Inter (in fact it is Montero’s 42nd birthday today). I was ejected.
When the game was over my father and Nonno told me that instead of Brio, the one I should emulate is Scirea. I never saw him slide tackling or with a dirty uniform like Brio, he was just another player on defense – but from that moment I started watching him play for the first time really paying attention to his style, and grew to admire and respect him immensely.

No, what I’m saying is Nainggolan is versatile as hell too, so Bonaventura doesn’t any advantage there if do one day change formation.

Steiner has always been a wingback & that is where he is currently playing. How many times did Giach actually play on the left for us? 2-3 time? Peluso is still a full back playing at winback, what does he offer going forward? Caceres has always been a CB, that’s always been his main position. Marrone’s always been a DMC. Conte has done nothing with these players to convert them into a new position. He’s only ever done this with Kwadwo & that was always going to work given his massive engine/workrate

Bonaventura is not mediocre, and I’m not sure if you’ve paid attention to him during his matches against Juve last season, he was actually active during the game and one of 2 players who looked dangerous. He’d be a great young addition to an already talented Juve mid.
As for Naingollan, he brings something different from Bonaventura. He has grinta and is more physical, while he does not lack the intelligence.

I admit, I haven’t seen Bonaventura play as much as you. I’ve only seen him around 5-7 times last season (including one match against Inter). He has some good performances, but I’ve never been really impressed by him. Nainggolan on the other hand, is the most complete midfielder after Vidal in Serie A and arguably one of the most complete midfielder in all of Europe. Yes, his attitude makes opponents dislike him, but so is Lichtsteiner. That’s just their over competitiveness, and that’s a good thing.
And if your argument is that Conte can make Bonaventura play LWB (a position he never played btw) and CM, what’s to say that Conte can’t make Nainggolan do the same? Bonaventura has never played LWB, and I prefer Asamoah and PDC at that position over him. And in midfield? He doesn’t have enough quality to challenge Marchisio for a starting spot.

WhoScored statistics eh? good source but I found their ratings sometimes tends to be subjective, the funny thing is sometimes they overrate players, simplest of examples is Giovinco…
For those who never watched Giovinco these stats suggests that he’s an awesome fantasista or the second coming of Del Piero, while in reality we know that he’s far from what suggested in that page.
What I’m trying to say is to know them (Bonaventura, Nainggolan, Giovinco, whoever…) you have to SEE them for yourself, that’s why clubs paying scouts, they aren’t paid to look at WhoScored or any statistic pages, but to SEE and make their own assessment on the said player, I followed Bonaventura last season, so I trust what I saw.
You can carry on and say that Nainggolan is better than Bonaventura, Radja may be better than Jack in certain aspects such as his defensive attributes, but for me Bonaventura has more to offer for this Juventus team than Nainggolan since he can play wide and central on the midfield, plus we don’t need another douchey player who will most probably complain coz he don’t get enough playing time (Remember ELIA), Bonaventura on the other hand… is a Juventino, he DREAMS of playing for this team, IMO he’s a younger and more… MORE talented Giaccherini, so signing Bonaventura will have more logic than signing Nainggolan.",Linez ,"Sep 3, 2013 ", 2:33 AM,

On strength, Whoscored gives 2 kinds of rating: strong and very strong. My understanding is that strong meaning the player has above average ability on that particular area, while very strong meaning the player is way above average on that particular area.
No one can deny that Giovinco is a good dribbler and has a good vision for through balls (and thus, key passes). He’s a very good set-piece taker, and the few games I’ve seen him play on wing, he can deliver good crosses into the penalty area. So, why didn’t he became the second coming of Del Piero? It’s his poor decision making and finishing. He often made the wrong choices (passing when he should dribble/shoot, shooting when he should pass, etc.)

Arsenal needed a defensive mid to serve 2 functions: 1 is to protect it’s back four, 2 is to provide an option for a backpass from their creative midfielders if the way forward is blocked. Sort of like Yaya Toure in Man City. Ozil is not that guy. Napoli and Arsenal both have amazing offense, but questionable defense. It was like that before the transfer window closes, it still is after.
Taking the discussion further, I think the Ozil signing is done as an announcement for the whole world that there is a paradigm shift in Arsenal. They are basically saying to all the agents and players all over the world that they’re done being a selling club, and they really want to fight for the title once again, so if Arsenal wants you, you better join.

Quag apparently is the one pushing for the move since he wants playing time , regardless of Conte being sad at his departure. Quite a u-turn but I guess the wage bill will be lower perhaps? Gilardino can be a decent sub, but I would’ve loved this transfer years ago…today it just doesn’t mean what it would back then. Matri leaving seems Juve wanted to cash in on him now rather than later.
Looking at things like this:
2012-13 Strikeforce: Vucinic, Giovinco, Matri, Quagliarella, Bendtner/Anelka
2013-14 Strikerforce: Tevez, Vucinic, Llorente, Giovinco, Gilardino
2013-14 >> 2012-13

We can also monitor his progress closely, he can join the first team training once in a while, especially considering we’ll be lacking cover in CM, so who knows maybe he can play during scrimmages or whatever. It’s better than sending him out to another Serie B club and he warms the bench.
The talent should still be there somewhere. He’s still a Raiola client, and if that fatso has any good side, it’s that he can motivate his client to achieve something in their life. And he is also still quite young, so if he really sets his mind to it, he can adapt his playing style, if necessary. Much would depend on his personality.

Assuming that happens it leaves 4 mids that will play heavily including Radja next year. Even with Pirlo staying he would see less and less playing time allowing the rotation of the 4 remaining mids (inc. Radja) which will be necessary especially after a World Cup year where players will be tired the coming season. All midfielders will probably be involved in the WC as well.

And we can see that Conte is preparing for life after Pirlo this season. The team has become less reliant on him to build up play and create chances, and it’s a good thing. Because there’s no replacement for Pirlo. He’s a very unique player. We will need to make a tactical change in midfield when Pirlo leaves. I think it will be Pogba replacing Pirlo as the pivot, but with more of a Vieira’s/Davids’ style (providing defensive cover with freedom to get forward) than Pirlo’s style (sitting back, spraying passes to teammates).

- We’re very short of option in midfield. It’s true that we have 4 great midfielders, but when 2 of them can’t play our option to replace them will be Padoin *shudder. Oh, and forget about Asamoah playing in midfield, Conte sees him as LWB and that’s it. Signing Nainggolan now would not only provide quality cover, but also give a quality rotation option.
- Conte is actually trying to “phase out” Pirlo starting this season. Marchisio’s injury doesn’t show that yet.
- Signing him now will give him time to adjust to live at Juve. When we need more significant contribution from him next season, he will be ready.
- There’s no reason not to sign the second most complete midfielder in Serie A.
Yes, the price (18m not 15m) sounds steep, but we shelled that amount for Asamoah and Isla. Asamoah might have become a regular starter now, but people thought that he was signed to become a backup to our midfield. The fact is that deals like the ones with Vidal is very rare.

Pretty dumb to ignore Conte in the initial stage only to listen to him during the advanced stage. Now, if we’re talking about Berlusconi, that might have been entirely believable.
From what I know, Lazio came into the Quags equation too late, and obviously if we dealt with Lazio, we wouldn’t have been able to get a replacement in time. Whereas if we sell Quags to Roma, we could’ve gotten a replacement in Gilardino (in that 3-way deal involving Borriello). Naturally Conte as the coach would prefer the Roma deal.

Next to two of Pogba, Pirlo, Vidal or Marchisio and if he is given the job of ball winner/destroyer, I think he could work in emergency situations.

The Naingolan crap is the perfect example. The second reserve of our BIG 4 in midfield was our the last need into the transfer market. Marotta was ready to spend twice the amount of cash he spent for attacking players. I mean ‘what a f**k?’ can’t you find a high level winger/attacking midfielder with that cash ? He have 1 weakness in our squad and that’s the presence of a Reus, Ozil kind of player. Find one with those 15+ million…instead of the defensive reserve Naingolan.

Open Summer Transfer Window Deadline Day Thread,Danny Penza,"Sep 2, 2013, 12:00am PDT",,"I think most Juventini (myself included) praise Marotta for the job that he’s done. He’s very shrewd, but the team is EXTREMELY strong. Let’s also not forget that while the direness of the “financial situation” tends to be overblown by management, in many ways we are still not in the position to be dropping €30m+ on a single player. That time will come, but I suspect it’s still 2-3 seasons down the road.
We all have our criticisms of Beppe from time to time, but we can’t forget some of the brilliant purchases he’s made over the course of his tenure (Vidal, Poga, Barzagli, Pirlo, just to name a few).
I for one agree with your assessment of our need for a back up midfielder, and in the end I do feel we are left a little stretched. However, I think we will be fine, at least until January. If we take last year as an example, both Giaccherini & Marrone got less than 1300 minutes combined playing time in the midfield across all competitions. That being said, I think Pogba will be enough to cover. In a bind, I believe we can move Asamoah into the MF and deploy PDC/Caceres on the left flank, preferably against lower tier teams.
As for the suggested transfer targets of Ozil or Reus, both are attacking midfielders, a position we don’t really use in the 3-5-2, and I don’t suspect Conte is going to change his formation anytime soon (based on his own rhetoric). While Nainggolan seems to split opinion quite fiercely here, I do think most people see him as a lower tier Vidal. The thought process is to purchase him for a fair price and have him potentially improve under Conte, thereby taking him from a “good” player to something better than good.
Either way, it’s all moot now that the market has closed. Marotta would have been much better off targeting a quilty LB/LWB, i.e. Coentrao, to usurp Asamoah, and let Asa fight for a spot on the wing and in the MF. The fact that Marotta didn’t try, and that Man U almost secured his services, definitely leaves a bit of a bitter taste in everyone’s mouth.
Our team is definitely much better off than it was a year ago. The additions of Tevez, and to a lesser extent Llorente, are already paying dividends. I’m also confident that Ogbonna will be one of the cornerstones of our future back line.
Let’s no get overly critical of Marotta just yet, at least not until we actually HAVE the big money to spend, then we can all go wild!",MatteoX ,"Sep 3, 2013 ", 2:04 PM,
Open Summer Transfer Window Deadline Day Thread,Danny Penza,"Sep 2, 2013, 12:00am PDT",,"look…Marotta is decent but nothing more. He is lucky, that’s for sure. You talk about lack of money but he spent 55 million one year ago on Asamoah, Isla, Giovinco and Peluso. He has ready to spend another 18 million for that defensive midfielder from Cagliari. 70 millions for 1 starter and 4 back-ups. The point is that Marotta has no clue about winning football… his real level is as a grinder in a rebuilding club. Having money for him does not mean better players, but spending more for the same type of players. Ozil and Reus where bought 2 years ago for 12 and 17 million by Real and Dortmund. We can’t buy them now, but we should spend time and money finding the next Ozils and Reuses. The fact that this kind of playmakers are not in Conte’s plans is just non true. Giovinco and Giaccherini are similar players and the Mister is not a taleban …he changes tactics if a player is worth it. What I’m saying is that you can’t win the champions league if you spend 20 million for decent guys in reserve roles and not for some known or less known possible game changers.
We need a GM who understands offensive talent and has the mind and balls to make sh*t happen. Marotta spent 90 million for Krasic, Elia, Martinez, Giovinco, Quagliarella & Matri. You can put in Toni, Anelka and Bentner in the mix. Vucinic, Tevez and Llorente are good buys, but we are talking about players over 27. We NEED a GM who can find the next great 21-23 offensive player at cheap prices…. it’s the only way to improve into the next 2-3 years when we will able to spend big money as you say.

I heard the Palmeri report also, I am torn. I suppose it all comes down to how much confidence we have in Giovinco. After Llorente smashes his first volley we’ll be reminded of what a force he is.

I think the criticism on Buffon, despite the spilled ball which leads to the Lazio goal, that he should catch or grab all those shots? is somewhat unfair. I mean just look at the first shot from Hernanes, you couldn’t expect someone to catch and grab the ball there, and Buffon did what he had to do, block it wide; and according to my own count, he actually did grab from a shot twice. Besides, most of the shots made yesterday were swerve shots, and I remember Radu’s left footed shot was bouncing, I think an experienced GK like Buffon wouldn’t like risk losing his grip when trying to catch a spinning ball which can lead to an embarrassing Papera.
When was the last time we see Buffon made 11 saves in a game and still concede? IMO he deserves a solid 7 with two 0,5’s taken from both Pirlo and Pogba for not providing the better covering; the rest of the pagelle pretty much spot on.",Linez ,"Sep 1, 2013 ", 11:58 AM,

I would ask that everyone goes and watches the replay of the possession and the play leading up to it. As the ball is passed to Hernanes, Pogba is beginning to close down the space (as he should) and Pirlo is trotting over to cover the space that Pogba will leave open when he moves forward. Then as the ball reaches Hernanes, Pogba stops and holds his ground instead of closing all the space and Pirlo also stops because now Pogba is right in front of him. You can see the evidence of this in the photograph above and the body position of Pirlo and Pogba. This allows Hernanes time to shoot and then eventually leads to the goal.
I repeat the initial fault for this goal lies with Pogba not closing down the space and then to Buffon who should have parried that to the side. If Marchisio is on the pitch in this exact situation instead of Pogba we most likely do not concede this goal; however, it would be ridiculous to expect someone as young as Pogba to understand everything immediately and I have no doubt he will get there sooner rather than later.",oliviero ,"Sep 1, 2013 ", 6:05 PM,
"Juventus 4 : 1 Lazio — Welcome home, Juventini",JRob,"Sep 1, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"You maybe right, but Pogba also needs to consider the left flank. It was just outside of the picture that Linez posted, but there was a Lazio player unmarked there, and Hernanes could’ve easily made a pass there for a free cross. You know how much Conte hates a free cross…
Feel free to burn me again and again, but Pogba needs to understand that defending starts before even the player you’re marking against (either in your zone, or your man marking target) gets the ball. He should have moved closer to Hernanes before Hernanes even got the ball, so that whoever had the ball before Hernanes hesitated passing the ball to Hernanes. This is one aspect of Claudio’s game that people doesn’t recognize, because it’s done off the ball, and even off the camera. There’s a reason why Claudio is one of those who runs the most, along with Vidal and Lichtsteiner (and maybe Asamoah this season).
Again, this is in no way intended to say Marchisio is definitely better than Pogba. I merely pointed out which part of Pogba’s game needs to improve, and incidentally the man he replaces has that aspect in abundance.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 1, 2013 ", 6:39 PM,
"Juventus 4 : 1 Lazio — Welcome home, Juventini",JRob,"Sep 1, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"I agree with most of this except I question that fact that he is responsible having to cover the left flank… The more I look at this possession the more defensive positioning mistakes I see, I think Asamoah is actually way too far back and should be the one responsible for marking the man out of the picture on the left if the ball were to be played out there.
I also think Asamoah currently plays his position more conservatively when Pogba is in the lineup as opposed to Marchisio because he has more confidence in Marchisio’s defensive covering as they have developed an understanding. That will still take a few more games for Pogba and Kwadwo to develop but I think when they do get it right it will also affect our offensive balance. Pogba’s passing vision will make Asamoah a more dangerous offensive threat down the left than if Marchisio were in the team albeit giving more opportunities for a fast winger to burn us on the counter down that flank… That is why Pogba needs to get the defensive positioning right so we don’t get opened up that way and concede those Icardi type goals from last year.",oliviero ,"Sep 2, 2013 ", 9:18 AM,
"Juventus 4 : 1 Lazio — Welcome home, Juventini",JRob,"Sep 1, 2013, 6:00am PDT","I'll try to explain, though it's very difficult without pictures","Asamoah was pulled centrally because Lazio had the ball in their left flank, so our whole backline shifted towards the right, and Asamoah had to maintain the distance between him and Chiellini, so that no gaps appear in the backline that could be exploited by Lazio’s runner from deep. Just before Hernanes received the ball (I think it was from Radu), we could afford to let that left flank of ours a bit free, because switching flanks take time and our defense would have enough time to adjust. But when Hernanes received the ball, he had enough space to do what he wants to do, whether to shoot or to pass it wide to his right; and you can’t allow that with a player of Hernanes’ calibre. You simply have to close down the space, so that Radu was forced to pass the ball backwards instead. Or if that Radu indeed decided to pass to Hernanes, despite the close marking, Hernanes had no option except to make a one touch pass, which is ultimately more difficult. So if Pogba (or Pirlo) had closed down Hernanes, that free space in the left flank wouldn’t have been an issue. It became an issue when Hernanes received the ball with ample time to decide what to do next.
Going back into my first sentence above, it’s also a recurring theme in Conte’s Juve to have both wide men (Asamoah and Lichtsteiner) maintaining width in the offensive phase of the game (thus the moniker 3-3-4). Sometimes you can even see Pogba and/Vidal positioning themselves wide. The goal is to obviously stretch the opponent’s defense, so that gaps appear in the center that could be exploited by runners from deep. Combine this with Vucinic and Tevez’ push and pull movement, you can see how Lazio (whose midfielders weren’t very keen on tracking back) were having issues with Vidal’s movement from deep. And that very gap that Conte seeks to exploit, is the very gap that Conte doesn’t want to see in our backline, hence Asamoah’s “conservative” position in that Klose goal.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 2, 2013 ", 7:02 PM,
"Juventus 4 : 1 Lazio — Welcome home, Juventini",JRob,"Sep 1, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"Oh, also to add. If you look carefully in our defensive game, there’s always a formula which Conte abides to almost like it’s a religion: at least one man marking the opposition with the ball, and one man covering to deter that man from taking his marker one-on-one. I think it’s something that is taught in Coverciano, because it’s something that is everpresent in Italy, and not so much elsewhere. Anyway, in this situation, if Asamoah is the marker, then either Chiellini or Pogba would be the cover. So, Pogba still needs to be mindful of that left flank, even if Asamoah gets the primary responsibility.",JDAngkasa ,"Sep 2, 2013 ", 7:23 PM,

Nice workout yesterday, but beating up B squads is no longer satisfying after the past two seasons. Still looking for the move up in class. And I’m mystified by all the praise for Llorente. He missed a golden opportunity to head in a goal from a beautiful cross early, when it mattered. I see two differences between Llorente and Matri. 1. Llorente plays with a lot more flair and beauty. 2. Matri scored goals for us, including some in games that mattered. Can’t wait for Quags to return.
Finally, Tevez is definitely a step up in class. Our number one player this season. Pirlo and Tevez give us a recent track record of being the right spot for under-appreciated world class players to revive dormant careers. Keep ’em coming !",Ricardo 1 ,"Oct 31, 2013 ", 7:01 AM,

Glad Buffon isn’t being tested so much, clean sheets will give him some confidence hopefully, so when teams do start testing him, fingers crossed he’s Superman again!
Conte, give PDC a position where he doesn’t have to defend, his attacking game is outstanding and, to be fair, his defensive game was pretty good last night, too.
Commentators were slagging off Llorente again. Anyone else find how one dimensional commentators are? he got into some good positions, linked up well with the rest of the team and the only thing he didn’t do, was put the ball in the back of the net.
We’ve come to expect nothing less from Tevez, Isla was good (not great, or Udinese-Isla, but good), Pirlo was brilliant, too. He looked like the Pirlo that entered the pitch in his first season for us!
Now it’s time for me to praise Giovinco. Sure he didn’t score and sometimes he had options to play the ball wide, but he was too busy shooting 4? great shots, as well as setting up a goal, to play the ball wide. He’s playing smarter and smarter with each game he gets. The super sub role seems to suit him at the moment, perhaps he can be our Ole Gunnar Solskjær. only shorter and with 6 billion times more energy.

I think PDC would work well in a 4-3-3 or perhaps even better in a 4-2-3-1/4-1-3-2?, IF he can play like this consistently.
Gio and PDC are two players who have actually played exceptionally well for us in the past (Under Ferrara, I think?), but PDC was let down by injury and Gio had one bad game which spelled the end to his pre-Parma Juve career.",Shaulan ,"Oct 31, 2013 ", 6:17 AM,

Juventus 4 - Catania 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 30, 2013, 4:30pm PDT",Some thoughts,"First things first lets run through the team and their respective performances.
Buffon… did he even make a save? I think he did but I can’t actually remember if Bergessio shot, basically nap time for Gigi.
Our defense was very solid for a second straight game with the notable exception of Mr. Bonucci who is, let be honest, having a terrible run of form. Caceres has stepped right back into the side after the great performance against RM. His return from injury gives us an extra measure of security on the right and will allow us to give some much needed rest to Barzagli as the season progresses along with added flexibility in our formations. Chiellini had another one of the great performances we had become accustomed to in the last two seasons, although occasionally his judgement should be called into question. His recovery when Bonucci tripped as the last man was absolutely out of this world but what is the point of that bone-crunching tackle at midfield on Bergessio when we are already up 3-0? He could easily have picked up a red card for that and we’d then have to deal with no Chiellini in either competition for a few weeks. Finally Bonucci was the really pretty bad tonight even though he did get on the score sheet and was bailed out by Chiellini and Caceres on several occasions. He was spraying passes all over the field and too often those passes either went directly out of bounds or to a Catania player. He looked out of sync with the rest of the team both in possession and when defending and I’m not exactly sure why. He really hasn’t been the same since the made that silly back volley against Galatasaray.
Both Isla and PDC were really good today and did exactly what was required of them. PDC did a better job of adding the the offense with his crosses and running down the flank and his work rate on defense was commendable. Isla looked significantly more solid on defense and in possession than I have seen him in a while and also managed a few nice one-two’s with Vidal and Tevez. He really needs to work on the timing of his crosses and understanding when there is space available for him to cross and when there isn’t but with how he preformed while tracking back I think he deserves to be praised for this performance. Interesting to see Isla slide over into central midfield at the end of the match but not for long enough or against opposition strong enough to make any judgements. Both these players are solid backups for our starters and that’s exactly the way it should be. Subbed in on the wing was our man Marco Motta………………………..
Our MVP triangle in the middle of the park played a good match and bagged two of the goals even though Vidal had an underwhelming performance. Conte was screaming at him all through the first half that he was playing soft and I have to agree with the mister on this one. Vidal’s tackles didn’t have the usual bite to them and I thought he played a sloppy first half in possession often giving the ball away cheaply and misjudging his teammates movements. To me sometimes he appears to be over thinking his play and he just needs to settle down to play within his rhythm like he did against RM. I won’t go to in depth about Marchisio since I think dweb summed it up well above except that I also thought he was a bit too sloppy in possession especially when going forward. Marchisio really helps Pirlo play because he understands when and how to give Pirlo the easy layoff pass and when to make the late run into the box to overload the opposing teams defense. Finally in the starting midfield what is there to say about Pirlo? Had a classic Pirlo match in possession and scored a gem but he also defended very well and had a few very nice slide tackles. Pogba came in for Vidal and added more solidity to our midfield than Vidal had been providing both by retaining possession, adding to the teams attacks, and defending the break.
The forward line was great today. As they accumulate minutes together Llorente-Tevez is looking more and more like the kind of partnership that can terrify opposing defenses with size, strength, technique, and speed. Llorente is getting better and better with every passing minute he is on the pitch and as his understanding his the rest of the team is improving he adds an entirely new dimension to us going forward. Although today he did miss a few guilt edged opportunities I have to commend him for his defensive work rate and willingness to sacrifice for the team and I think the goals will come soon. Tevez had another great performance with yet another goal and with what looked to me like a clear penalty, then again it was Mr. Guida reffing this match so….. Tevez’s willingness to drop deep and help get our attacking play initiated is wonderful to watch and really speaks to the kind of player that he is. Additionally his defensive work rate is maybe one of the best I can think of int he modern game. The one criticism I continue to have is that he is often wasteful in possession because he wants to barge straight through the opposing defense, and although I love his spirit in that regard sometimes I wish he would help us manage spells of pressure better. Giovinco is the only other forward we have in any shape to play and he is actually fitting into the super sub role quite nicely. Every game Giovinco has entered into as a sub he has injected more pace and intent into our attacking play and has been rewarded with goals and assists. I wonder if he will be happy and accept filling this role for very long… lets hope so.
Things I think I think…
#1. Our formation is not actually that important when we play with the intensity that we have shown in the past three matches. I’m not saying that tactical adjustments are not necessary, I’m saying that first and foremost our players need to be concentrated and play with the type of speed and intensity that we know they can. That is what we had really been lacking up until the Fiorentina game and it is what we have rediscovered in these past three games. It is naive to believe that the reason we had been playing below our standards was due to the formation. It was about how we were approaching the games and our mentality not where we were on the pitch.
#2. That being said I think the 3-5-2 should be our default formation against the majority of the sides in Serie A because it fundamentally works and allows us to defend well and overload teams in areas we are strong in. We do however need some formation flexibility and the 4-3-1-2, the 4-3-3, the 3-4-3 are all ways we might consider playing in order to be less predictable and give teams different looks. I think we can make it work especially since we showed it was possible to play a formation we are unfamiliar with effectively against an extremely high level team in RM.
#3. Scoring a few goals and keeping a clean sheet on Saturday against Parma will be crucial for our confidence and will help resolidify our identity as a team. I think the Parma match will be a game to use a 4 man back line in view of the match against RM next week sincce Parma has an extremely fast winger in Biabiany that will be a good test for the formation before Tuesday.
Anyways that’s all for now…

- Vidal didn’t play well. If his usual standard is a 6.5, he played a 5 last night.
- Chiellini was a monster, and he saved our asses in this game. Primarily he saved Bonucci’s ass, which brings me to my next point…
- This is the 2nd straight bad game for Bonucci. His decision making has been utterly garbage.
- Tevez is a beast, but we all know that already
- Llorente didn’t do well, too
- Marchisio was quite average. He had some good highlights, but also some not so good. Certainly not one of the “invisible” games that people often associate him with…
- Seba, in my view, sometimes tries too hard to get a shot. It’s all good if he wants to score, but the one time he made a last pass, it turned into an assist. He shouldn’t stop shooting, as attempt on goal from a striker keeps the defenders honest, but he also has to adapt his game a bit to create more chances rather than just trying to finish half-built offense. With that said, though, he did quite well in his cameo.
- Isla did what Padoin would do: be average. I don’t understand why if Isla does it, then we suddenly become appreciative, whereas when Padoin did it, we say he’s mediocre. Well, if Padoin is mediocre, then Isla yesterday was mediocre.
- PDC also did alright, but not at all great. Still not enough to even compete with Asamoah for a place in the starting XI, but should suffice as a back up / rotation option. The question next year, though, is: do we want a back up, or do we want a competition for Asamoah? Bear in mind that next season, we’ll have to navigate through African Cup again.
- Pirlo. Though his freekick is great, IMO that’s not the highlight of his game. I think what’s interesting from recent Pirlo performances (Genoa and now Catania as well) is how Pirlo positions himself, which is much more forward and aggressive than usual. I think, Pirlo is changing his game ever so slightly. He’s an incredibly intelligent player. I think he knows that his performances this year has been meh, and he’s trying to do something about it. A top class player can adapt and change his game as situation develops. Del Piero did that after his injury, Totti does that as he gets older and slower, and now Pirlo might be on the verge of doing that as well. That’s how I’d like to believe it, at least.
Overall, I think the scoreline flatters us a lot. We didn’t do THAT well. If the performance in Genoa game is worth an 8, then this game is worth a 6.5, or 7 at most.",JDAngkasa ,"Oct 31, 2013 ", 11:40 PM,

after winning the treble my first season, last season we were unfortunately knocked out of the Coppa Italia, but we won the Supercoppa, Club World Cup, Champions League, and Scudetto. Tevez had 45 goals total on the season, Gabbiadini in second with 15. After all sorts of rumours about moving on, luckily, Arturo Vidal committed his future to Juventus, however, the rumours persist about a potential Chelsea move for Pogba as Mourinho sees him as the ideal midfield recruit. Simone Zaza was sold for an underwhelming 7.5 million euros, however Romelu Lukaku was brought in. Pirlo retired, and both Arjen Robben and Jerome Boateng were brought in on free transfers from Bayern Munich.

Juventus 2:0 Genoa - Bianconeri Back On Track With A Win,ivoandov,"Oct 28, 2013, 11:52pm PDT",Pirlo's contract situation is a bit of a predicament,"his situation is currently a fine mix of Del Piero’s situation and Pirlo’s Milan exit. Juve want him to stay, AT LEAST for his experience to breed Pogba. His best season, 2011/2012, is the season that he only have to play once per week most of the time. However, oddly he still want to play every single game. he is not comfortable with bench. We all remember him leaving the pitch incident after being subbed off. he is not like giacch or matri who’d accept bench role. I think the ideal situation is to give him a one year extension with the option of another one extra year (option given to pirlo). That would be my final offer. He had too many howlers for a 3 year contract.

Juventus 2:0 Genoa - Bianconeri Back On Track With A Win,ivoandov,"Oct 28, 2013, 11:52pm PDT",,"I have never read anything about 3 year contract. Most I’ve seen is 1 year extension. I think much like Buffon, Pirlo will retire in 2016. Whether that’s with Juve or elsewhere, nobody knows right now. So yes, I’d offer him one year contract, with probably an option to extend.
As for Verratti, I do want him at Juve, but not at the expense of Pogba. Pogba is more versatile, more well rounded, more level-headed, more advanced in his development. While he sometimes lack the discipline and maturity needed at this level, Verratti is much much worse in those aspects. Unless Pogba is determined to move to PSG, I wouldn’t entertain any offer for him. If PSG comes to us offering Verratti for Pogba, I’d say to them instead, “Forget about Pogba; this Verratti kid, how much do you want for him?”.
Selling Pogba for quick cash, while some would argue that it would be the logical thing to do if an astronomical offer arrives, sends a wrong message to the whole world. Besides, if PSG are willing to offer, say, 50m for Pogba right now, how much do you think they’d offer in 3-5 years time? That kind of imaginary figure should be enough to get rid of any stupid short-term thinking out of our brains.

Juventus 2 - Genoa 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 27, 2013, 10:25am PDT",My thoughts,"Danny, your thoughts are spot on.
We could have easily won this game by 4 or 5 goals if we were more decisive with our chances, but I’ll take 3 points and a clean sheet. Tevez + Llorente are starting to clicks – I’m curious to see how dangerous they are 2-3 months down the line (if we still deploy the 3-5-2).
Thoughts on some players:
Asamoah: 3-4 weeks ago I was quite critical of his offensive form. He’s gone on to prove me wrong. The last few fixtures he’s really stepped up his game and starting to try out different moves. Shooting from his right, making key passes, dribbling better, taking on his man, etc. Kudos to him for improving his game.
Vidal: Had a fantastic game. 8 tackles from our midfield warrior. It’s nice to see him find his form. I just pray that he puts pen to paper on his extension ASAP.
Pogba: I think we’re being overly critical of him. Keep in mind he’s played in every fixture this year so far for all 90 minutes (with the exception of the game against Milan). He’s already booked 1100 minutes for this club and we’re barely 25% of the way through the season. Anyhow, for today’s performance, he wasn’t spectacular and there were a few times he could have made a better pass or decision, but he did pose a threat, positioned himself well, and created opportunities.
Llorente: I think the criticism of his performance in today’s game is unfounded. True, there were a few occasions were he scuffed a pass or gave away possession, but he played quite well. Finally we have someone on the team who can win a kick from our GK, posseses an aerial threat, can play with his back towards goal, and also play some nice one touch football in the box. Today he took on his man a few times, distributed play well, and found himself in excellent positions. Give this man some time and he will be an absolute BEAST.
Isla On paper he had a solid game, but I was not impressed at all. In fact, I thought he was quite poor. At least today he did a bit better job defending, and in the second half I did count 2 decent crosses he put into the box. The reason I rate him poorly today was the amount of times he turned over the ball or failed to complete a very simple pass. Truth be told I really don’t know what to think of this guy any more. I think it’s unlikely he’ll be offloaded in the winter market, and we really do need a back up RWB/RB. Whether Caceres comes to fill that role, I don’t know. I’d like to root for Isla, but he’s definitely a liability for important fixtures, at least in his current form. I suppose they way they are handling him is perfect – give him playing time against weaker teams and see if he can regain any part of his former self.
Defense Our CB’s looked solid today. Bonucci was a bit disappointing as I don’t feel he really tried playing a lot of long balls or dribbling through the middle. Most likely reason is that Pirlo had space.
Next stop: Catania.",MatteoX ,"Oct 27, 2013 ", 1:19 PM,
Juventus 2 - Genoa 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 27, 2013, 10:25am PDT",I've so little to say since I barely watch the game...,"But from the goal highlights, I can clearly say that the penalty call waskind of harsh, matter of fact there wasn’t even a foul, Biondini had a touch on the ball before he made any body contact with Asamoah, tough call nevertheless since the touch itself was so insignificant, so insignificat that I’ve to look at the slo-mo replay like 8 times. As to weather the alleged foul happened inside the box or not, Asamoah was already inside the box when Biondini made the contact.
From the little things that I saw.
1. I caught Pogba once did his usual mistake, holding the ball too long just outside of the penalty box, this time on the left flank, saying that… we all expected him to be in the place of Pirlo in the future, so I guess it’s kind of a learning process.
2. Bonucci dribbled all the way to the edge of the 2/3rd area to just waste his effort, lucky we have bologna this time, as I’m pretty sure Merda, Napoli, Roma, and even Atalanta would capitalise that counterattack opportunity.
I know these are just small details in their whole 90 minutes, but we must not forget that they seemed to got punished on any little mistake they made in the previous games, they have to be perfect and to be perfect they need to simplify what they do.

Juventus 2 - Genoa 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 27, 2013, 10:25am PDT",,"City failed to impress. That strike by Aguero was a beauty though. Chelsea controlled much more possession than I would’ve expected and even with his miss in front of goal, Torres had a solid game. One thing the announcer brought to my attention is that Chelsea’s wingers easily switch sides and still play well. I got to thinking that’s definitely something we miss at our team, the ability to stay within formation and change player positions to throw the opposition off guard. It’s what Fiorentina did by switching Cuadrado, and it burned us. Every so often we see Vidal & Marchisio switch, but it never seems to have an effect.
Back to topic…not sure if it was such bad keeping as it was very poor communication with Nastasic, either way, what a terrible way to lose the game.",MatteoX ,"Oct 28, 2013 ", 7:49 AM,
Juventus 2 - Genoa 0: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 27, 2013, 10:25am PDT",,"it’s funny, cuz the stats point more towards City playing possession and Chelsea on the counter. Aguero’s strike was out of nowhere, it was immense (Cech never expected that either). Torres had a good game, but was quite wasteful tbh.
About the wingers thing, in a 3-5-2 it’s quite hard for the wing backs to switch position b/c they are the only ones on their respective flanks. It’s easier to do in a 4 man defense b/c worst comes to worst, at least you still have a full back behind you to cover. In a 3-5-2, it can suddenly then happen that one flank is COMPLETELY bare, making us even more susceptible to a counter than we (already?) are.
In a 4-3-3 it should be doable though, but then we should play with one true winger and either a wide forward (tevez) or a wide playmaker (ala David Silva, Juan Mata, or even Erik Lamela):
Part of the reason for Conte’s formation change was to accommodate Pogba, Vidal, Pirlo and Marchisio in the same side, something that theoretically works with a more narrow shape – but Marchisio isn’t suited to a wide role, and Juventus could have done with a proper winger on the right to add more directness, and to stretch the play when attacking.

Plus, having someone who can hold the ball in the final third alone is a huge improvement.

I’m just not satisfied with those basic mistakes. One which I remember very clearly was when he received a pass on the left flank, near the halfway line, when we were being pressured by Genoa. Instead of holding the ball, or pass it back down the line to Asamoah, he kicked the ball right back to the centre, just in front of the penalty box, which was immediately intercepted by a Genoa player.

-Vucinic is good but not as good as him, he might have better dribling but he’s not an aerial threat and wastes a bit too much. I’d rather have a player contributing every time he’s one the pitch than one who decides to show up once in 5 games.
-Apache was also perfect but he needs to start controlling those balls, instead of opting to shoot every time,he should try to lay it down for other teammates.

Besides from that, I think it is good that we have a mean machine type player taking shots more often and scaring the opposition.
Consider this; if one player shoots and shoots and shoots, the defenders will learn and try to block his future shots, thus leaving free space for passes. That’s what Tévez does, he shoots at will for the first 20-30 mins, and then having meddled with his rival’s minds, he can either shoot again or set someone up.

Juventus vs. Genoa Preview: Round 9 — Home is where the heart is,Danny Penza,"Oct 26, 2013, 9:00am PDT",,"Some things that I am thinking:
Campionato Tomorrow’s game against Genoa will be an important one. Going up against a fairly week Genoa team shouldn’t be too much for us to handle at home, but let’s hope we don’t have the CL hangover. Furthermore, we know that every teams plays extra hard against Juve, so we can’t let our guard down. It’s integral we get 3 points tomorrow, as we don’t want to fall too far behind Roma, especially this early in the season.
Back to the 3-5-2 After a strong showing out of the 4-3-3, I suspect Conte will return to the normal 3-5-2 for tomorrow’s game.
Strikers With a choice of only 3 strikers, it’s a safe bet that we’ll probably see Llorente + Tevez start tomorrow. I’d expect a Seba cameo a little later in the game. Let’s hope Llorente can continue building on his form.
Midfield I’m starting to rue the sale of Giaccherini. Not having a 5th midfielder is putting a lot of pressure on our current crop. My money says Vidal takes a rest for tomorrow games. However, I really think that Marchisio also deserves a rest, and Pogba has played quite a few consecutive games as well. The only other option would be to play Asamoah in the midfield, but that is very unlikely to happen. Which brings me to…
Wingbacks I’d like to see PDC get some time tomorrow off the bench. I’d say we start with Asa on the left and see where that takes us. On the right, if the rumors are true, I’d be OK with seeing Isla slot in ahead of Padoin.
Defense IMHO, Chiellini & Barzagli should both be on the bench tomorrow – Chiello for his poor performance and Barza to get some rest. I say Peluso – Bonucci – Caceres as the 3 man backline.
Looking forward, I’m excited at the prospect of the 4-3-3 being used from time to time to keep our opponents on edge. One thing that I am really thinking though is that in the course of the next two markets management really needs to start doing a serious evaluation on some of our players and what they bring to the squad. I’m not talking about our core starting XI, but more of our fringe players. I’d rather see us have a few less 3 string players in exchange for more quality second string players.
Anyone know what the status of Pepe is?",MatteoX ,"Oct 26, 2013 ", 5:16 PM,

Juventus vs. Genoa Preview: Round 9 — Home is where the heart is,Danny Penza,"Oct 26, 2013, 9:00am PDT",Why change??,"If the 4-3-3 is a system which Conte deems useful against top class opposition with strength on the flanks, and some of our troubles domestically this season have been down to our ever present predictability (of formation, selection and tactics), a home game against Genoa is to me, a perfect opportunity to blood the new system more thoroughly. It is all very well practising the formation in training and in friendlies against village teams, but to improve it, to strengthen it, to push it to become second nature to our players, it needs to be deployed on a more regular basis in a competitive environment. Such as a home game against Genoa, who will set out to defend deep and hit us on the counter.
Caceres deserves to start.
Do we really need three centre backs against Genoa?
Ogbonna could certainly do with some more settling in to the starting XI routine.
I would go for …
Buffon
Caceres Barzagli Bonucci Ogbonna
Vidal Pirlo Marchisio/Asamoah
 Pogba
Tevez Llorente
(I would be happy to see Asamoah as the LB)
Closer to a 4-3-2-1 than a 4-3-3. Had Chiellini been in better form I would have stuck him in at LB, for whilst others do not enjoy him there, in a flat back four I feel he remains, hugely the strongest option we have in that role. Ogbonna is similar, more naturally brilliant in the centre, but can play out wide, just don’t ask him or Giorgio to provide consistent support on the flank, and they shouldn’t need to with Pogba and Pirlo pulling the strings between midfield and attack, Vidal and Marchisio hustling and driving forward, Tevez scrapping like a pit-bull and the majestic lion up top ready to knock down to marauding midfielders or go for goal himself.
I think this idea of our crossing suddenly improving is close to dead. Neither Asamoah nor Lichsteiner are great crossers of the ball. Lichsteiner is a quality RWB, world class RB. Asamoah is a decent LWB, quality central midfielder. As our squad grows stronger we need to adjust to play to our strengths, not shoe-horn our best players into roles which do not bring out their very best…
I have been completely consumed with the absence and recent return to my wanton embrace of my savage Queen, and now feel like the hole in my soul has been filled…yet I have managed to keep abreast of Juve matters, and the despondency I have seen in the faces of our players when yet another goal has been poorly conceded has been of some concern.
Its still early days in the season, and it is fair to say we deserved more in Spain during the week. Its also fair to say we played with an intensity and organization we had missed for much of this season thus far, and yet we still left with nothing…Its one thing to play poorly and win, but to play well and lose is worse and less than encouraging.
The lack of grinta. The lack of concentration. A sense of lethargy has affected us domestically and on the continent. The Roma result was said to be the kick start we needed…Now its the Madrid defeat which is the kick start we needed??
I will be happy to win 1-0, control the game and avoid any of those consistent and costly individual errors which have haunted us all season.",thegutterpoet ,"Oct 26, 2013 ", 8:06 PM,
Juventus vs. Genoa Preview: Round 9 — Home is where the heart is,Danny Penza,"Oct 26, 2013, 9:00am PDT",,"I may be eating my words in a few hours (let’s hope not), but during Conte’s first season Juventus played against Genoa after a string of draws. The game against Genoa saw Juventus play remarkably well, but they couldn’t score and they finished with another 0-0 draw (the fourth consecutive one). But the team clicked for the first time in weeks.
After that game, Juventus played against Fiorentina beating them 5-0 in Florence. Juventus would go to win all of the remaining matches except for a tie against Lecce.
Against Madrid we saw the Juventus of old, even though they didn’t win. Let’s just hope that just like against Genoa, Juvetus find that fire inside to turn things around. No team that has allowed 10 goals in the first 8 matches has won the scudetto. But that is why I love Juve, because they pick themselves up and fight again, just as we did after tying to Genoa a few years back, and hopefully just as we will do after losing to Madrid last week.",JRob ,"Oct 27, 2013 ", 12:38 AM,
Juventus vs. Genoa Preview: Round 9 — Home is where the heart is,Danny Penza,"Oct 26, 2013, 9:00am PDT",,"We only have 2 fit strikers and 1 playing with painkiller. It’s too risky to deploy them all at once. Like it or not, our current squad is ill-fitted to play 4-3-3 continuously. Sure, we can deploy Marchisio as a right winger again, but that’s not ideal because of 2 things; 1) Marchisio was played as RW specifically to neutralize Marcelo, and 2) We only have 4 CMs (if we count Asamoah as LWB, which I’m sure Conte does) so playing them all at once would be just as risky as playing all 3 attackers at once.
Once in a while, we can play 4-3-3 to surprise the opposition. Playing 4-3-3 all the time will be bad for the team over the long run because we don’t have the depth for that, and also because we would end up being predictable again. I’m fine if we play 3-5-2 against Genoa.

“[Recission clauses are] used a lot abroad and there is the opportunity to use it here too, but we don’t think that clause always represents trust between a club and a player. Actually, it’s usually the opposite. Seeing as we have an excellent relationship with Arturo Vidal, Paul Pogba and Claudio Marchisio – serious professionals who want to wear the Juve shirt – we won’t include any such clauses in their contracts.”
What do you think — is this a smart move? One that could bite Juve in the ass in the event that any of those three transfer? Or does it not mean very much at all?",dweb ,"Oct 25, 2013 ", 7:43 AM,

OFFICIALLY OFFICIAL: Juventus announce six-year deal with Adidas starting in the 2015-16 season,Danny Penza,"Oct 24, 2013, 2:35pm PDT",,"Yeah and I also think that putting a release clause on a player is risky business. What if said player is in spectacular-Ballon d’Or-winning form for a season and the release clause is 40m, you risk getting low balled especially in the age of 100m transfer fees. Then again what if you insert a clause of 40m and the player gets badly injured or he’s a dud and doesn’t live up to expectations? Then you have a player that isn’t in good shape, his confidence is gone and nobody wants to buy him.
Releases clauses are a no-no imo, and the impression I get is that it’s the case for Juve too. From the sales of Giaccherini and Marotta’s words in the summer I’m under the impression that the club are willing to negotiatie the sale of any player under two conditions 1) It’s worth our time and isn’t an insulting offer (yeah, Monaco’s reported 20m bid for Marchisio wasn’t worth our time at all) and 2) the player wants to move",Arks ,"Oct 25, 2013 ", 8:53 AM,

The ref is looking at it from the back, but the linesman has PERFECT full on view of it, and he should instantly tell the ref (through microphone) if it’s a red of not.
The linesman really choked.
Also, about how Chiellini put his arm accross Crynaldo, as was talked about on the previous thread, I posted this:
“Honestly, I do that (and see it) quite often in my football “career”. The thing about this is, you have to do it smartly. Don’t hold your arm too high for too long, b/c then it becomes too obvious for the ref. But hold it for enough time at the right height, and you put the opponent off just enough to tick him off, bring him slightly off balance, and halt his go-go-gadget-turbo run. It’s also really a hand-to-eye coordination issue. You’re looking at the ball so you can’t look at the player at the same time. By putting your arm across you create a tactile reference for yourself so you know where the player is exactly and how quickly he’s running at/past you. The issue is simply HOW long do you keep your arm across and how high?
You can’t keep you arm there forever anyway b/c you have to use it in your running motion to run faster.""",Chuks A. ,"Oct 24, 2013 ", 2:15 PM,

"Real Madrid 2:1 Juventus - Madridistas celebrate, Bianconeri wonder 'What if'",ivoandov,"Oct 24, 2013, 1:43am PDT",About the game,"and my total feeling about it is summed up as a Bittersweet Symphony
Sweet: We played a fantastic game and showed Madrid really aint all that We attacked well, played with variation, intensity, and unpredictability (though sometimes a little narrow but Caceres compensated that fantastically) and, generally, solidly defensively. We weren’t outclassed at all, with 11 or 10 men. We conceded few clear cut chances; how many saves did Buffon really have to make? We can beat RM. We can be the Juve that we KNOW we are. We can rise
The tactics more than the formation was spot on. Marchisio on the right to nullify (with Caceres) Crynaldo and that hyperactive adrenaline pumped Marcelo was intelligent, also b/c Marchisio’s drifts inside gave us 4CMs vs. their 3CMs.
Bitter: This, in a peculiar way, was all too predictable. We play shitty against minor opposition, but when the pressure is on, we step up our game and play a fantastic 90mins. But why JUST start doing this now? Why not in the Torino, Chievo, Gala, Milan games? How do I know we’re going to continue this or that this was just b/c of the emotion and adrenaline of the occasion (of playing a team like RM in Madrid)? Of all times we play brilliantly, we get stolen by a ref, and we end up empty handed. It’s just all too typical.
About the formation: let’s not be too quick to ditch the 3-5-2 just like that. One of the strengths of tactical flexibility is unpredictability (and evolution). Keeping 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 in our arsenal will keep opponents and coaches guessing, so we have to keep them both around. Though in Europe I prefer 4-3-3 and in Italy I think 3-5-2 will do. If we’re gonna play 4-3-3 I rather have one player that keeps width (Isla? Licht? Gio?) on one side and then Tevez and Llorente as the other strikers.

Im confused sorry bout that…. Pirlo is arguably one of the best free kick specialist and passers’ Italy and Europe has ever watched. The type of football that is being played now, year by year evolving to a faster and faster game and you can see it harder and harder for him to be effective for 90 minutes. I thought the second half with Vidal sitting and distributing was an amazing sight. When Vidal or Pogba drop it allows for more attack cause they can cut off most attempts at a counter attack, where Pirlo unfortunately looks like a traffic cop. when Juve plays the style of football that we are blessed to watch (last night being the best in months) they cant afford for one player to be a liability on one side of the ball. As i am as big of a Pirlo fan as any, it is true that he is having one heck of a tough go this season. It is predictable and a proper game plan can really effect his impact on the game. (as we have seen against many of the smaller Italian teams this season)
And as tough as it is to say Chellini needs to have a sit….. It may not of been a red but to put your self in that position is another mental break down. The first goal was him and two of the goals in Florence were all him. He has played a role in the majority of the goals this year which kills me to even say……… Bonucci and Barz in the middle back, Caceras was a beast and prop the best on the field last night….with Lich on the right could help for a few games to atleast remind everyone that we dont need to concede every game.

If the goal is to be very competitive in Serie A and squeak into the knock out rounds of the CL, then the mission has been accomplished. If the goal is to be genuine contenders for the CL, a rethink of the squad and tactics are in order. Reminds me of Capello’s teams.
It was a typical battling performance, especially since Chiellini’s red card. However, another CL match, another two goals conceded. The forwards still struggle to finish the chances that are created. It was a better performance from Caceres, considering we’ve gotten little offensive contribution from the flanks in recent matches.
I just think that the whole midfield will need to be rethought as it is clear that Pirlo may be suffering with the amount of playing time (especially considering that he’ll get little rest this summer in Brazil).",VoxMediaUser210412 ,"Oct 23, 2013 ", 4:42 PM,

Also, IMO, he’s not a left back, he’s a central defender, and one who was playing out of position against a very good squad.
Caceres is a strong utility player with the ability to play well in multiple positions, but to suggest that he should get the starting nod over Lichsteiner on the right (when healthy) is a bit of a stretch. IIRC, Caceres plays LB for his country, and he would fit in there perfectly for us as well. He should also get more time at RCB when Barza needs a game off.
Chiello is a staple of our team, but he was in a way singlehandedly responsible for us losing tonight. The penalty he conceded was completely avoidable, and while that challenge against CR was definitely not a red, there was still no reason for his hands to be that high up and put himself at risk for drawing a bad call such as the one that happened. Honestly, he deserves to be benched until he can re-earn his starting spot. Bonucci/Ogbonna/Peluso can start there in the mean time.
Gio looked impressive, but I was livid when he didn’t take that shot, what a wasted opportunity.
MotM for me is a difficult choice. I was critical of Vidal in the first half, but damn did he atone for that in the second. Tevez, while failing to score, made a tremendous impact on the game, and is such a key dynamic to our squad. They’ll have to share for this one.
We play Genoa this weekend, so I expect us to witness some squad rotation. Hopefully this game will mark some sort of a turning point for us. I’m not yet convinced on the 4-3-3 with our make shift wingers, but when Vucinic returns to health we will have him and Giovinco we can easily play out wide.

Juventus 1 - Real Madrid 2: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 23, 2013, 3:15pm PDT",,"4-3-1-2 could be very good formation for Juve to transition… Caceres can play RB and LB, and Asa can play LB as he has done so for his country. We have notied that his defensive coverage, except for the Fio game, is superior to what he provides going forward, especially after AFCON. Lichsteiner would be in his natural position at RB, so we would have good options to choose from, and playing full backs doesn’t take so much out of our players physically as deploying wing-backs. All four midfielders can be deployed in a diamond in this position, and even Asamoah can play here in place of Pirlo if Conte opts for a more physical and pacey midfield. Gio and Tevez can even play in the whole, or the latter can play up top next to one of Llorente, Quags, or Vooch. I’m still hoping for the day that Conte plays Pogba in an advanced midfield position and reverts Marchisio back to his more natural, central position, but looks like he prefers to play Marchisio closer to the strikers… Not saying this formation will be the new thing for Juve, but its an easier transition than the 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1, and it could get these players used to playing in a 4-man back line system. We definitely do need to make so quality signings this January though. We hardly spent any money this summer, so management should look to make really good moves next window. I agree with most of you in the idea of bringing in a winger or inside forward, but I would also want to make a move for another quality CM. I really like Jorginho, hes very young, talented, creative, and has showed that he can score too. Getting Veratti any time soon would be very difficult and expensive so he’s out of the question even though he would be my number one pick. Next season, we would have Berardi available for the RW (can also play LW/inside forward position) too, not to mention that we have Zaza and Gabbiadini… and… Immobile………………… so we shouldn’t need many major acquisitions in the forward line. A proper LB is another option that needs looking into during the summer… I still have a soft spot for our home-grown Criscito. Still disappointed as to how he was treated by the Italian FA in that whole match fixing affair, even though he was cleared of all charges. Lack of proper LBs on the Azzuri squad, yet Prandelli doesn’t select him, when he can have De Sciglio play his natural RB position and Criscito on the left… Sorry got off track… I still think that the 3-5-2 is going to be Conte’s mainstay for this season for the large part, though his decision to change things up pretty significantly in one of Juve’s biggest matches may be a sign that he is showing that he is willing to be more flexible. Maybe its all the pressure from fans, management, his realization that the exclusive use of one formation has become static and predictable, who knows, but I look forward to more changes. If we can change formation from time to time, playing against us would be less predictable even if we did play 3-5-2 as it wouldn’t be deployed every single match.",Nuncio#7 ,"Oct 23, 2013 ", 6:01 PM,

Juventus 1 - Real Madrid 2: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 23, 2013, 3:15pm PDT",,"Thoughts:
- I’m surprised a lot of people blame Chiellini/Ogbonna/Pirlo for the first goal. If anybody has to be singlehandedly responsible for the first goal, then it would be Caceres. All 3 defenders ran up to set the offside trap, but Caceres stayed back, and he looked hesitant to step up for one split second when he saw his teammates run up. If you don’t want to blame Caceres, then you have to say it’s a system breakdown, or just say it’s a brilliant pass by Di Maria, and composed finishing by Ronaldo.
- Chiellini’s challenge on Ramos was dumb, and the way he stopped Ronaldo using his arm was also dumb. But I agree with everyone that red was harsh. As I wrote last week when talking about Gervinho, a foul on high speed often looks worse than it actually is.
- Marchisio had to stay back to track Marcelo, because once Marcelo runs past you, you definitely can’t chase him. Because Marcelo’s runs were tracked or stopped by Marchisio, Ronaldo was left a bit isolated, one against 2 in Barzagli and Caceres. Aside from the 2 goals, tell me when did Ronaldo threaten our defense? That is because Marchisio. He is not a RW, and he wasn’t played as RW by Conte. He was put there to give some defensive stability against a team full of brilliant individuals.
- Continuing the above point, anyone noticed how we scored our goal? Marchisio occupied Marcelo, drifting inwards, Tevez harrying the CBs, Llorente drifted to the far post, forcing Arbeloa to track him (because the CB pairs seemingly oblivious to Llorente’s positioning, and Arbeloa is the only one looking across to notice that). And Caceres was free to deliver his cross because just a few moments earlier, Cristiano was moaning about his polished nails after that shoulder charge by Barzagli at the other end of the pitch. So nobody picked up Caceres, he delivered a ball to the far post, which I initially thought was a bad cross, and turns out Pogba reached that ball while peddling back, and still managed to head the ball on target, forcing a save from Casillas.
- Vidal risked himself with some challenges. I thought he was already on a yellow, and was worried that we might have to play with 9 men. When Asamoah was going to come in, I thought he’d be replacing Vidal. Turns out Marchisio was the one booked during that Ronaldo penalty incident, so Vidal was clean. At that point I realized that Vidal was not being reckless; he was just that determined. Crazy good, this guy. He’s worth more than Bale, surely. And that kick-the-grass incident, it’s actually because he felt that Illarramendi clipped him when he was swinging his right foot to put a low cross in. I don’t know whether the clip was enough to warrant a yellow card, but that was definitely not “he kicked the grass, and to hide the embarrassment, he asked for a penalty”.
- The commentator said a lot of things, a lot of them bullcrap. But he also said one thing that I thought spot on: Benzema, since Higuain left, simply faltered. He sucked last night, the worst player on the pitch. That surely says something about his mentality.
- Ref was poor, very poor. Modric foul on Gio should have been yellow, Tevez fouled on the edge of the penalty box should have been given, and many many decision against us was downright silly (an example: Vidal taking the ball away from Modric, but called as foul just because Vidal did it from behind).
- Finally Conte admits that 3-5-2 can only takes us so far. He’s finally willing to try something that we’ve been screaming for since ages. This is big, for someone as stubborn as Conte. Now that Chiellini is suspended for the next 2 games, I have high hopes that AT LEAST in the next 2 UCL games, we will play 4-3-3.

I am hardly diplomatic. The foul doesn’t deserve a red card, agreed. But Chiello shouldn’t have put his arm across Ronaldo. Looking at the replay you will see that Chiello didn’t even look at the ball until he put his arm across. He was only concerned about Ronaldo, and as a true Italian defender, thought “the ball may pass, but the man cannot!”. That’s risky business, to say the least. But in any case, I fault the ref more than Chiello there.
Our players did very well, given the circumstances. And I’m actually satisfied with what I saw. It’s just a pity that because of Chiello’s stupidity in giving away a penalty, and ref’s overall poor performance, we didn’t get the result that we deserved.
In any case, I was worried for our season after Florence.

Honestly, I do that (and see it) quite often in my football “career”. The thing about this is, you have to do it smartly. Don’t hold your arm too high for too long, b/c then it becomes too obvious for the ref. But hold it for enough time at the right height, and you put the opponent off just enough to tick him off, bring him slightly off balance, and halt his go-go-gadget-turbo run. It’s also really a hand-to-eye coordination issue. You’re looking at the ball so you can’t look at the player at the same time. By putting your arm across you create a tactile reference for yourself so you know where the player is exactly and how quickly he’s running at/past you. The issue is simply HOW long do you keep your arm across and how high?

Juventus 1 - Real Madrid 2: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 23, 2013, 3:15pm PDT",Chielini,"Please, let’s stop complaining about the refs and Giorgio’s fouls. His foul that gave away the PK was brazen – and stupid. Just because Giogio’s tackled so many others on corner kicks and gotten away with it doesn’t mean it’s not a foul. Driving 55 in the 40 mph zone for a long time without getting ticketed doesn’t make it a defense when you’re finally caught. I warned last Spring after he did the same bear hugging/tackling on corners vs Celtic so brazenly that sooner or later a ref was going to call it, and last night one finally did. The second call was also a foul. And he was beaten. Complaining that our defender who didn’t keep his arms down and got carded is just whining. One of the oldest and most enduring rules of defensive discipline is “keep your arms down.” I’ll grant you it was questionable whether it merited a straight red, but he’d already used up all his good will and it was a definite risk. A more subtle body check might have just earned a yellow.
Giorgio appears to have lost a full step in the past year, a natural consequence of all the knocks he’s taken and all he’s left on the pitch playing full throttle. His aggressive offense following the first goal was a noble display of heart and desire, but while Giorgio’s spirit is still willing, the flesh is weak. It’s a very young man’s game, sad to say. Giorgio, Gigi, Pirlo and even Barzagli are looking mighty old lately and often overmatched as a result.
Sad to say, but we played our best after Giorgio and Pirlo sat.
One other observation. At the 33 minute mark, when Tevez took a long shot and the goalie spilled it, what the heck was Marchisio doing with his back to the goalie, trotting away ? There was a garbage goal opportunity three feet behind him. Youth soccer players get benched for such play. Did Marchisio forget how we scored our goal ? Llorente pounced on a fumble and we tied the score.",Ricardo 1 ,"Oct 24, 2013 ", 4:14 PM,

Watch the game again and please do count how many times Manuel Grafe gave Madrid benefits of his doubt, in all fairness… Ronaldo should see a yellow for his play-acting, Illarramendi should see his second yellow for clipping Vidal in the penalty box, another penalty call for fouling Gio inside the box, LOTS of them, but why he didn’t seem to hesitate in calling them against us? Even Caceres got a yellow for “dissent”, what a fucking joke!

The only reason it is still a debate is because Gigi would have gotten the ball even if Chiellini didn’t strangle Ramos. Here the interpretation in Europe and in Italy is different. In Europe, even if you’re far away from the ball, if the opponent fouls you in his box, then it’s a penalty. In Italy, not necessarily.
Illarramendi fouling Vidal is extremely difficult to call. Even after the replay, it remains debatable that it would have been enough to warrant a penalty. The ref did give a lot of advantage to Madrid throughout the game, though.",JDAngkasa ,"Oct 25, 2013 ", 9:05 PM,

Champions League Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Real Madrid,Danny Penza,"Oct 23, 2013, 10:15am PDT",I don't like the look of this year's Juve one bit,"The defence is heavy. Having Chiellini and Barzagli can be awesome against crosses getting whipped into the box, but not against fast inline-striker-wingers like Ronaldo or Di Maria. Normally, one of the defender-trio would charge the ball and the other would cover the space left behind by the defender doing the charging. Chiellini is afraid to charge Ronaldo/Di Maria because Bonucci is not there to cover for him.
Pirlo is losing his game very fast, and the management should be very alarmed. If this game is to be salvaged, I reckon Pirlo needs to be pulled for Giovinco, and play 433 with Giovinco on the right/left (rotate with Tevez) and with the MVP-ogba middle.
Asamoah is paying for his errors against Fiorentina, but this game was the worst time for him to have made those mistakes AND for Conte to be passing him over. We need his speed on the left in a major way.
Overall, we look slow, heavy and static. Totally strange to the Juve we’ve seen these past two years, especially two years ago. I partly blame it on the 352 – it has done us good – but using it exclusively is only hurting our fast-paced game we’ve witnessed with the 433.
If Conte continues like this this season will be a disaster.

Juventus vs. Real Madrid: You choose the starting lineup,Danny Penza,"Oct 23, 2013, 1:55am PDT",For all kinds of reasons,"- Firstly, all good things come to an end
- The fatal 3rd year syndrome
- Conte’s over-intense playing style taking its toll on the players? Even Barca have begun pressing less as they realize it’s somewhat unsustainable in the long run
-Tactics schmatics? Is the 3-5-2 being figured out or is Conte being too stubborn? Is Conte not evolving Juventus enough? (as the Guardian article refers to, (or it might be another one) evolution can be key to keeping players mentally engaged and challenged as they encounter new ideas instead of the same old same old all the time)
-Is the 3-5-2 taking its toll on our full backs? Having an entire flank to yourself game in game out is bloody tiring.
-Are our Serie A tactics not suitable to the CL? As ZM mentions, a chronic problem Italian sides face is that they’re so accustomed to playing against sides that never press, that they seemed shocked and perplexed when playing in Europe against high-pressing sides.

I know this leaves Asamoah on the bench but I think defensive solidity at the back should be the priority and for me this back line offers the best guarantees in that regard. I’d rather not have Caceres return to CR7 and I prefer Ogbonna + BBC or Caceres on the left(he plays there for Uruguay) because Chiellini with the ball at his feet against Di Maria scares me and he’s better in the middle anyways… If we somehow go up by a goal or two and we need to defend we can sub in Asamoah for Pogba or Pirlo and flatten out the midfield too.

It’s incredible how much I’ve actually come to appreciate Bonucci in the last few years, he’s such a technically-gifted CB and relieves the creative burden off Pirlo. He reads the game excellently and I think he’s a must for this Juve in defense.
Still, both Pirlo and Leonardo Bonucci, now well-known as Juve’s vice-Pirlo in terms of hitting long diagonals from defence, were given freedom to play clever forward passes

Honestly, I don’t know…looks like we’d sacrifice a little bit of width, however to have Vidal/Marchisio both being able to simultaneously provide cover to our full backs as well as Pirlo, I think it might help us alleviate the threat of Real’s potent wingers.
Or more realistically, I’d say field a 3-4-2-1 (3-6-1). It’s madddd risk to just start fucking around with new formations against Madrid. An extra midfielder would help us control the game a bit better, plus we get the benefit of having all our centerbacks on the pitch at the same time

Juventus 2 - Fiorentina 4: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 20, 2013, 9:20am PDT",It has been coming...,"Well what to say about this match?
First off the 4-2 scoreline is very flattering to Fiorentina’s play over the course of the whole match but not for how they played for the last 20 min. I was watching on BeIN Sport ES and about 10 min into the second half the announcer said Fiorentina only needed to one goal to regain the belief that they could get back into the match… I thought he was right but I didn’t imagine he would be so right. Second Rocchi was atrocious, note I’m not blaming him for the loss that was all on us, but he f***** up this match horribly.
This was a tale of two halves if I’ve ever seen one but was also heavily conditioned by how the referee chose to officiate the match. I honestly have no idea how Tevez managed to get a yellow card for that foul on Cuadrado except that he MUST have said something to Rocchi because the foul was barely anything at all. Then we come to the first of two incidents that I think Rocchi mishandled completely in Aquilani’s foul on Bonucci. That should have been a RED CARD foul! A sliding tackle from behind in the defensive side with a scissor kick at the end?!?!?! I don’t care what minute of the match this was in that is a RED CARD simply for the intent and potential for injury, especially if Tevez’s foul 3 min beforehand was a yellow. OK so after that there was the so called “soft” penalty on Tevez which I also think Rocchi mishandled. I think he was conditioned by the yellow he gave Tevez because had he not given that yellow I think this would have been a no call. OK nbd it’s more of a penalty than most that Milan get anyway and Gonzalo Rodriguez knew he messed up right after the play happened. Then Barzagli got a yellow… I still have no idea how if this is a yellow the Aquilani foul isn’t a red? The last 10 min of the first half we dominated and pressed and did very well to get the second goal. Also Aquilani should have been sent off again for his elbow to Pirlo’s ribcage… Jus sayin
In first 15 min of the second half with a 2 goal lead and an eye on the Wednesday night match we sat back and did a very good job of managing the match and creating some decent opportunities while they were unbalanced forward. Also how on earth did Roncaglia not get carded for whacking Llorente in the face? Then we come to the second incident that I thought Rocchi really messed up. Savic slides into Pogba with a locked knee and his studs raised up raking across both of Pogba’s legs and only gets a YELLOW!!!!!! Clearly Rocchi wasn’t going to send any Fiorentina players off on the night because BOTH Aquilani and Savic deserved reds for reckless, violent, challenges that easily could have injured our players. Again I note this is not an excuse for losing, that’s all on us, but at least in my opinion they were both red card challenges.
Then came their penalty incident, which I think was a very well disguised dive much like Boriello on Friday since Mati Fernandez is falling even before Asamoah makes contact, but I can’t blame Rocchi on this one since I think even I would have given that penalty at full speed. This is where the match began to unravel for us and where Fiornetina believed they could win the match. Pogba and Buffon can share the blame for the second goal but mostly these three next goals demonstrated the current difference between Marchisio/Vidal and Pogba. Pogba is a wonderful player I think we can all agree, but his problem right now apart from his defensive covering is that his ego becomes inflated during the course of a match. Actually those two issues are linked because as his ego inflates during the match his defensive work rate decreases and his ego causes him to makes cheap turnovers in our half as he tries the spectacular when a simple pass would be the best choice. Note that I am talking about our defensive half since I really don’t mind when he tries the spectacular close to the opposing team’s goal but there were several plays even before the goals where this happened and I was practically tearing my hair out. He was emblematic of Juventus tonight, a great first half and a second half to forget.
I have to call out Tevez because he has a fatal flaw that is really hurting our team of late and he really needs to stop. Every single time he gets the ball he charges forward with it and attempts to batter his way through opposition defenses. That might work in England but It will never work in Italy. He just runs forward and into about 3 or 4 defenders every time!!! His desire, work rate, and technique are great but he needs to wise up sooner rather than later because he turns the ball over so often without allowing the rest of the team to even move up the pitch. Juventus’ offense has been predicated on moving numbers forward and EVERYONE participating in the offense generating lots of goals from a lot of different players. I understand that Tevez was brought in to help with the scoring burden but right now he is trying to score outside the system instead of aiding and participating in it. This is exactly why Vucinic is so important to this side he helps everything move better. Llorente showed me flashes today but he did seem to slow down as the match progressed so I think he is still not quite 100% but we really need him to get there soon because I think he can be more helpful to how the team plays as a whole than Tevez.
Defense… I can’t bring myself to write anything about them since that was absolutely shambolic and I hope this has the same effect at the Inter match from last season but I have my doubts… And the wing play tonight was abysmal, hear that Marotta? Time for some upgrades in the wide areas.
Finally I will not stand for anyone criticizing Marchisio tonight who worked harder that literally everyone else and who could barely breath when he subbed out because of how much he had been running. He deserves the respect of every single one of us because he leaves his heart on the pitch after every single game.
I have to give credit to Giuseppe Rossi who I am super happy to see back to his old self and if anyone had to score a hat trick on us I would gladly give it to him above I think just about anyone else. And also to the Fiorentina side, even though I can’t stand the entire Della Valle family, who smelled blood and went for the jugular and Montella who I have always thought is a wonderful coach and doesn’t get nearly enough credit.

Juventus 2 - Fiorentina 4: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 20, 2013, 9:20am PDT",,"Valid points, much of those I agree with (especially on Rizzoli being a craptastic referee). A couple of points that I don’t agree with are:
- Savic tackle on Pogba, while looked bad at first sight, was clean. He won the ball and he slid with one foot. Sure, he came with studs showing, but he got the ball clean and clear, and the stud didn’t hit Pogba; it was indeed Pogba’s foot which ended up hitting Savic’s ankle (if I’m not mistaken). I agree that it was a dangerous tackle, but so were many other tackles in the game.
- Tevez running at defenders is not a “fatal flaw”. I’d even say we should have more players who are capable of doing it. It’s the sort of aspect that none of our other players have (perhaps to some extent, Vucinic and Giovinco can do this too), and adds that little bit of variety to our game, which has become too predictable at the moment. He might have to choose better moment to do those, but in no way it’s a “fatal flaw”.",JDAngkasa ,"Oct 21, 2013 ", 1:08 AM,
Juventus 2 - Fiorentina 4: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 20, 2013, 9:20am PDT",,"We can agree to disagree on the tackle but in my book a challenge with a locked knee “gamba tesa” and studs up is a red card.
I think you’re misunderstanding what I’m referring to with Tevez. I don’t mind if he wants to take on players one on one or as you call it running at a defender since he is a very skilled player and can do great things that way. What frustrates me is when he receives the ball as the farthest player up the pitch and then turns and charges forward without ever once looking up or around to see where his support is. He just ends up running at the entire opponents back line without support and then he invariably turns the ball over. In England in that situation he caused problems because the defenses are less disciplined and will break down because of that pressure. In Italy they are more often than not very well drilled and understand how to isolate him from his teammates when he does this and they eventually always get the ball.",oliviero ,"Oct 21, 2013 ", 7:43 AM,

But the way we collapsed is something I never thought i’ll see from Conte’s Juventus. It seems like every time we slip up we concede a goal. It also seems like every shot to Buffon will score. Ogbonna need his chance in defense it can’t possibly get any worse than whats on show right now. With Caceres back he to should be given a chance to show what he’s got in defense. I’ve been saying this since the season started that our play and build up is way to slow. What you practice is what you’ll preach and when it’s time to up the tempo we get punished time and time again because we don’t play with hunger from the start. We can never come put the blocks strong and run the game down our opponents throats instead we always have to concede before we react. Today was the opposite we score and then allow Viola to react because we failed to score the all important 3rd goal. I don’t understand why we never tried to signed any wingers in the offseason so we could change from 3-5-2 that’s getting ripped apart at will to the 4-3-3.,Juve 10 ,"Oct 20, 2013 ", 11:51 AM,

Gigi relies on his reflexes, unlike keepers Like Neuer, Casillas and Cech who anticipate shots on one on one situations, gigi believes he will react well and save. But the problem now is that he has lost that sharpness, leading to the concession of many goals in the joaquin situation. Its not like Icardi, joaquin or Kozak (Czech vs Italy) finished fantastically well, but Gigi no longer reacts as he used to in the past. Another case in point is Bendtner’s first goal, his reflexes failed him again. Its going to be hard or impossible to recover from this, as reflexes like Pace, when lost can’t be gotten back.

In fact, my wife had to check in on me because I had been so quiet for so long during a Juve game. Absolutely speechless.
The BBC defence is broke, and needs to be fixed. Teams saw last year how they could beat it, and this year they’re implementing it. Buffon is looking more and more flustered this year, and hasn’t been otherworldly except for a few flashes. The five-man midfield with it’s dependence on the wingbacks is getting stale. It barely works in Italy, it will not work in Europe. Tevez.. for all his effort and persistence, simply has to hold up play at times.

The right wing has been struggling in the absence of Litch, Pogba and Pirlo have been caught in possession in our defensive half and Vidal hasn’t been the warrior we saw for the previous two seasons, that’s lead to goals, however in the previous two years, if they made a mistake or the ball got through to the strikers, a lot of the time they could rely on BBC to clean up almost anything thrown at them.",Shaulan ,"Oct 21, 2013 ", 5:33 PM,

“How do we explain it? An explanation would be easy! In 10 minutes we destroyed all the hard work, both during and before the game. We managed to allow Fiorentina back into it and concede odd goals.
“This is football. We have to take these 10 nightmare minutes and learn from them. I continue to say this year will be very, very difficult.

Unless this article seriously distorts Contes statements (which is entirely possible), this completely destroys my hopes for this game being the wake-up call we needed. Expect some more-of-the-same against Madrid.

Game Time Thread: Juventus vs. Fiorentina,Danny Penza,"Oct 20, 2013, 4:30am PDT",It has been coming...,"Well what to say about this match?
First off the 4-2 scoreline is very flattering to Fiorentina’s play over the course of the whole match but not for how they played for the last 20 min. I was watching on BeIN Sport ES and about 10 min into the second half the announcer said Fiorentina only needed to one goal to regain the belief that they could get back into the match… I thought he was right but I didn’t imagine he would be so right. Second Rocchi was atrocious, note I’m not blaming him for the loss that was all on us, but he f***** up this match horribly.
This was a tale of two halves if I’ve ever seen one but was also heavily conditioned by how the referee chose to officiate the match. I honestly have no idea how Tevez managed to get a yellow card for that foul on Cuadrado except that he MUST have said something to Rocchi because the foul was barely anything at all. Then we come to the first of two incidents that I think Rocchi mishandled completely in Aquilani’s foul on Bonucci. That should have been a RED CARD foul! A sliding tackle from behind in the defensive side with a scissor kick at the end?!?!?! I don’t care what minute of the match this was in that is a RED CARD simply for the intent and potential for injury, especially if Tevez’s foul 3 min beforehand was a yellow. OK so after that there was the so called “soft” penalty on Tevez which I also think Rocchi mishandled. I think he was conditioned by the yellow he gave Tevez because had he not given that yellow I think this would have been a no call. OK nbd it’s more of a penalty than most that Milan get anyway and Gonzalo Rodriguez knew he messed up right after the play happened. Then Barzagli got a yellow… I still have no idea how if this is a yellow the Aquilani foul isn’t a red? The last 10 min of the first half we dominated and pressed and did very well to get the second goal. Also Aquilani should have been sent off again for his elbow to Pirlo’s ribcage… Jus sayin
In first 15 min of the second half with a 2 goal lead and an eye on the Wednesday night match we sat back and did a very good job of managing the match and creating some decent opportunities while they were unbalanced forward. Also how on earth did Roncaglia not get carded for whacking Llorente in the face? Then we come to the second incident that I thought Rocchi really messed up. Savic slides into Pogba with a locked knee and his studs raised up raking across both of Pogba’s legs and only gets a YELLOW!!!!!! Clearly Rocchi wasn’t going to send any Fiorentina players off on the night because BOTH Aquilani and Savic deserved reds for reckless, violent, challenges that easily could have injured our players. Again I note this is not an excuse for losing, that’s all on us, but at least in my opinion they were both red card challenges.
Then came their penalty incident, which I think was a very well disguised dive much like Boriello on Friday since Mati Fernandez is falling even before Asamoah makes contact, but I can’t blame Rocchi on this one since I think even I would have given that penalty at full speed. This is where the match began to unravel for us and where Fiornetina believed they could win the match. Pogba and Buffon can share the blame for the second goal but mostly these three next goals demonstrated the current difference between Marchisio/Vidal and Pogba. Pogba is a wonderful player I think we can all agree, but his problem right now apart from his defensive covering is that his ego becomes inflated during the course of a match. Actually those two issues are linked because as his ego inflates during the match his defensive work rate decreases and his ego causes him to makes cheap turnovers in our half as he tries the spectacular when a simple pass would be the best choice. Note that I am talking about our defensive half since I really don’t mind when he tries the spectacular close to the opposing team’s goal but there were several plays even before the goals where this happened and I was practically tearing my hair out. He was emblematic of Juventus tonight, a great first half and a second half to forget.
I have to call out Tevez because he has a fatal flaw that is really hurting our team of late and he really needs to stop. Every single time he gets the ball he charges forward with it and attempts to batter his way through opposition defenses. That might work in England but It will never work in Italy. He just runs forward and into about 3 or 4 defenders every time!!! His desire, work rate, and technique are great but he needs to wise up sooner rather than later because he turns the ball over so often without allowing the rest of the team to even move up the pitch. Juventus’ offense has been predicated on moving numbers forward and EVERYONE participating in the offense generating lots of goals from a lot of different players. I understand that Tevez was brought in to help with the scoring burden but right now he is trying to score outside the system instead of aiding and participating in it. This is exactly why Vucinic is so important to this side he helps everything move better. Llorente showed me flashes today but he did seem to slow down as the match progressed so I think he is still not quite 100% but we really need him to get there soon because I think he can be more helpful to how the team plays as a whole than Tevez.
Defense… I can’t bring myself to write anything about them since that was absolutely shambolic and I hope this has the same effect at the Inter match from last season but I have my doubts… And the wing play tonight was abysmal, hear that Marotta? Time for some upgrades in the wide areas.
Finally I will not stand for anyone criticizing Marchisio tonight who worked harder that literally everyone else and who could barely breath when he subbed out because of how much he had been running. He deserves the respect of every single one of us because he leaves his heart on the pitch after every single game.
I have to give credit to Giuseppe Rossi who I am super happy to see back to his old self and if anyone had to score a hat trick on us I would gladly give it to him above I think just about anyone else. And also to the Fiorentina side, even though I can’t stand the entire Della Valle family, who smelled blood and went for the jugular and Montella who I have always thought is a wonderful coach and doesn’t get nearly enough credit.

"Take your pick: Who should play against Fiorentina, Sebastian Giovinco or Fernando Llorente?",Danny Penza,"Oct 18, 2013, 8:00am PDT",,"Napoli has a good first squad but they lack depth. They are not too dissimilar to Juventus 2011-2012. I imagine that if Juve played in Europe during Conte’s first year, we would not have won the scudetto. This lack of depth is going to cost them dearly as they will drop valuable points after international breaks, and before and after Champions League matches.
Roma also has a good first squad, and they also lack depth. The issue is that their players are not tired/distracted by Europe. Moreover, I don’t think they have many players on international duty (I could be wrong about this part).
Juventus has potentially the best first squad of the three and have some depth. In some areas we are sorely lacking (i.e. Lichtsteiner is A LOT better than Padoin), while in other areas we are good (i.e. four CMs for three spots, or Buffon and Storari). The big questions is, is our depth enough?
Roma have been super consistent, but now with Totti injured, depth will start to play a role, specially if his injury is long. Moreover, Juventus have been through highs and lows of the season and still came out on top, Roma hasn’t. Juventus has shown enough mental strength to come back from -7 points to win a scudetto with a similar crop of players. Can Roma do that if/when they start dropping points and places.
Anyway, TLDR, It will be an interesting battle ahead. Forza Juve.",JRob ,"Oct 18, 2013 ", 3:12 PM,
"Take your pick: Who should play against Fiorentina, Sebastian Giovinco or Fernando Llorente?",Danny Penza,"Oct 18, 2013, 8:00am PDT",After watching that ugly ugly match in Rome today I'd say they're both overrated and that Orsato made a mess of this match.,"As I predicted last week Gervinho would start missing the gimmes. Today he was the Gervinho that I had seen at Arsenal; a totally one dimensional player whose speed is what allows him to play at this level and is far less skilled than he believes himself to be. The shot he shanked into the 20th row is a perfect example of him as a player and Napoli’s only semi-organized defense contained him without too many problems (Also he should have had a yellow for his blatant dive in the box).
Orsato clearly favored Roma in this match and was very sparing with his use of the yellow’s when there easily could have been six or seven players on each side that deserved at the very least a caution; Castan somehow did not receive a yellow even when he had 3 or 4 bookable offenses, Maicon kicked the ball back infield and down field after it had already gone out for a throw… Cannavaro on the other hand had his first foul turn into a yellow card(questionable according to how Orsato had been reffing the match) and then a goal(Pjanic with a gem) and his second yellow and concession of the penalty on Boriello was in my opinion Boriello being very sneaky and pulling Cannavaro down with him or at the worst “half a dozen of one and six of the other.”
Roma’s midfield is what really won the match in my opinion DDR, Pjanic, and Strootman played very well, battled hard all match and scored two goals. the next couple of games I think will be the true test of what this Roma side is capable of after the injuries the squad sustained today. A shout out to the people on this blog who pointed out that relying on Totti’s 37 year old legs for the creative spark would be a dangerous game to play… Roma’s defense on the other hand was suspect and Napoli had two chances that could not have been more clear cut, first with Pandev and second with Insigne the responsibility rest solely on their shoulders as they should have put at least one of those away(They also hit the post two other times with De Sanctis moving his hands down as if the ball was being skyied above him).
Napoli were unlucky to not at least come away with a point today but I think apart from those two missed chances the fault lies heavily with Benitez and his use of the doble-pivote or rather his choice of players in those positions. Behrami and Inler are basically the same player and although they provide a great deal of defensive cover(If it weren’t for Behrami breaking up two counter attacks Roma might have run up the score early in the second half) they do not provide enough distribution and ball retention to generate really useful attacking play. Additionally today they were outnumbered in the midfield and Hamsik, Callejon and Insigne did not help out nearly enough and consequently Napoli virtually gifted Roma the first half because of both being outnumbered and lack of buildup play. Unfortunately for Benitez he made the fateful decision of bringing on Cannavaro instead of Fernandez and we all know what happened from there. I think he might begin to play Dzemaili from the start in order to correct this but Napoli seem to have some serious holes in their roster and have lost Cavani(today he would have had a field day with the Roma defense) we will see how they cope after this loss and how Benitez decides to address the problems he has. Don’t know what to think of them yet really…
While I was posting JRob made some very good points as well but I think sooner rather than later we will see teams really frustrate Roma and then we will find out what they are really made of. If they can pull off a match like our 3-3 vs Napoli from two years ago then I will begin to rate them higher but for now I don’t think they’ve shown me the mental fortitude that JRob is alluding to.

"Take your pick: Who should play against Fiorentina, Sebastian Giovinco or Fernando Llorente?",Danny Penza,"Oct 18, 2013, 8:00am PDT","I'm gonna double post this, counting the one I've posted on the other thread","Roma’s game is pretty simple, actually. When they defend, they defend with number, leaving only Totti and Gervinho upfront. As they defend, Totti drops back and occupy the space between opponents defense and midfield. He has the ability to hold the ball, draw some foul or send a through ball for galloping teammates, namely Florenzi and/or Gervinho. Totti is perfect for this style. Per. Fect. Meanwhile, Gervinho floats towards the wing, and as he gets the ball, he’ll attack the goal with speed, hoping to either run through his man, or draw some foul, which at speed would look worse than it actually is, hence maybe drawing some yellow cards. In this phase, they are a capable counter attacking team. Not as specialized as Napoli under Mazzarri, but still a very good counter attacking team.
Meanwhile, when they attack, they try to pass around the 3 players in the midfield, while Totti drops back and attract defenders, creating space for Gervinho and Florenzi to attack as they cut in. They could do this because they have De Rossi – Pjanic – and Strootman, who is amazingly good both off and on the ball. This midfield trio is capable of rivaling Juve’s MVP in terms of solidity, even edges out slightly ahead in terms of creativity. Their fullbacks rarely commit themselves to bomb forward, hence adding to the defensive stability as opponents seek opportunity to counter. They instead stayed around 3/4 up the pitch, offering width if it’s needed. Additionally, De Rossi and Strootman take turns to stay back covering the D, hence their solidity.
If you understand what I’m trying to say, you’ll see that Totti is the fulcrum of this Roma. He’s very critical both in defensive and offensive phase of the game. Gervinho is also a very important piece to their counter attacking game. Totti’s problem is his age and endurance, while Gervinho’s problem is his lack of dimension. He’s a straightforward player, he’ll try to beat his man first and foremost, much like Krasic but with more variations to his moves. He lacks Krasic’s crossing ability, though. In other words, Roma’s problem will be their consistency; i.e. whether Totti can stay fit, and/or oppositions defender will be able to read through Gervinho, just like they read Krasic. Remember Krasic had a magnificent first 6 months in Italy, but then dwindled as his game becomes more and more predictable. No European commitment helps in both these cases (more time for Totti to recover, and less game for Gervinho to be analyzed).
Another aspect worth considering is how strong Roma is mentally. As they progress through the season, players and fans alike will realize that they have a great chance of winning the scudetto this very season, in a way like a now-or-never situation. Considering that by all possibility they will compete in Europe next season, they will encounter MASSIVE pressure, both from within themselves and from external sources, to grab the title NOW, just like Juve did 3 seasons ago. It has been said time and time again that Rome is not the best city to have tranquility, so I do think this will play a big factor in the long run.
I read somewhere that Garcia has played the least number of players this season amongst Serie A clubs, showing his dependency on a rigid starting XI. With last night’s fitness problems to both Totti and Gervinho, Garcia will start to face some serious challenges in the next few weeks.
TL, DR: Strong starting XI and no European commitment, however they have unproven bench and heavily dependent on Totti and Gervinho for their game, but Ljajic could prove a capable reserve (though I have my doubts). Main challenge is consistency over the season.",JDAngkasa ,"Oct 19, 2013 ", 3:12 AM,

"Juventus link dump: Pre-weekend, pre-Fiorentina, mega-Paul Pogba edition",Danny Penza,"Oct 17, 2013, 10:15am PDT",,"Great midfield. Defense that’s solid as hell. Sounds like it.
But it’s still early. We’ll see what it’s like coming out of the winter break when Roma plays Juve.",Danny Penza ,"Oct 18, 2013 ", 5:35 PM,
"Juventus link dump: Pre-weekend, pre-Fiorentina, mega-Paul Pogba edition",Danny Penza,"Oct 17, 2013, 10:15am PDT",,"Roma’s game is pretty simple, actually. When they defend, they defend with number, leaving only Totti and Gervinho upfront. As they defend, Totti drops back and occupy the space between opponents defense and midfield. He has the ability to hold the ball, draw some foul or send a through ball for galloping teammates, namely Florenzi and/or Gervinho. Totti is perfect for this style. Per. Fect. Meanwhile, Gervinho floats towards the wing, and as he gets the ball, he’ll attack the goal with speed, hoping to either run through his man, or draw some foul, which at speed would look worse than it actually is, hence maybe drawing some yellow cards. In this phase, they are a capable counter attacking team. Not as specialized as Napoli under Mazzarri, but still a very good counter attacking team.
Meanwhile, when they attack, they try to pass around the 3 players in the midfield, while Totti drops back and attract defenders, creating space for Gervinho and Florenzi to attack as they cut in. They could do this because they have De Rossi – Pjanic – and Strootman, who is amazingly good both off and on the ball. This midfield trio is capable of rivaling Juve’s MVP in terms of solidity, even edges out slightly ahead in terms of creativity. Their fullbacks rarely commit themselves to bomb forward, hence adding to the defensive stability as opponents seek opportunity to counter. They instead stayed around 3/4 up the pitch, offering width if it’s needed. Additionally, De Rossi and Strootman take turns to stay back covering the D, hence their solidity.
If you understand what I’m trying to say, you’ll see that Totti is the fulcrum of this Roma. He’s very critical both in defensive and offensive phase of the game. Gervinho is also a very important piece to their counter attacking game. Totti’s problem is his age and endurance, while Gervinho’s problem is his lack of dimension. He’s a straightforward player, he’ll try to beat his man first and foremost, much like Krasic but with more variations to his moves. He lacks Krasic’s crossing ability, though. In other words, Roma’s problem will be their consistency; i.e. whether Totti can stay fit, and/or oppositions defender will be able to read through Gervinho, just like they read Krasic. Remember Krasic had a magnificent first 6 months in Italy, but then dwindled as his game becomes more and more predictable. No European commitment helps in both these cases for Roma (more time for Totti to recover, and less game for Gervinho to be analyzed).
Another aspect worth considering is how strong Roma is mentally. As they progress through the season, players and fans alike will realize that they have a great chance of winning the scudetto this very season, in a way like a now-or-never situation. Considering that by all possibility they will compete in Europe next season, they will encounter MASSIVE pressure, both from within themselves and from external sources, to grab the title NOW, just like Juve did 3 seasons ago. It has been said time and time again that Rome is not the best city to have tranquility, so I do think this will play a big factor in the long run.
I read somewhere that Garcia has played the least number of players this season amongst Serie A clubs, showing his dependency on a rigid starting XI. With last night’s fitness problems to both Totti and Gervinho, Garcia will start to face some serious challenges in the next few weeks.
TL, DR: Strong starting XI and no European commitment, however they have unproven bench and heavily dependent on Totti and Gervinho for their game, but Ljajic could prove a capable reserve (though I have my doubts). Main challenge is consistency over the season.",JDAngkasa ,"Oct 19, 2013 ", 2:59 AM,

The lack of depth for both Napoli and Roma is the main limiting factor to their respective seasons. Once totti went off, Roma sort of looked devoid of any real intent. Without higuain playing, Napoli looked exceptionally toothless, and me sot and cannavaro appeared to be the weakest links defensively. Napoli will challenge consistently with the previous two seasons, however I expect injuries and tired legs to end Roma’s title chances.",water_jiggler ,"Oct 19, 2013 ", 6:29 AM,

The players don’t play with the enthusiasm of the first season under Conte. Remember the game against Fiorentina where we didn’t gave them a chance to play a pass on our half? That is what I miss in the current Juve (and you could already see it previous season).
Count the lesser form of Pirlo in and you get awful and stereotypic football.
We can count ourselves lucky we have more quality than in the first season (Bonucci is better at his role, Tevez, Pogba, Vidal has grown, etc.) or we wouldn’t be second right now.
We need more wing play, more speed and more creativity in the team.
I don’t think the 3-5-2 can give us that. So we will need to switch formation and tactics. But more important; we need to bring players in who give us more creativity, wing play and speed…
That being said, I’m quiet sure that if Pirlo finds his form back (and he will) we will get better. We will be dominant in Serie A again but like last year we will fail against the big teams in Europe.
You just need to look at the tactics and players teams like Barça, Bayern, Dortmund, PSG and Real uses.

""And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men.

Is this not true? Everything he said is true, what is the problem in saying this? In order to try and help solve the problem you have to recognize and acknowledge it. He is one of leading people that wants to see reforms in Italian football, to see it return to the levels it once had.
So you think he’s against Pogba requesting a higher salary and that somehow that would make Juve sell him?
Agnelli, like you posted said, “If we got a massive offer for someone like Pogba”
Keywords: massive offer, someone like
Massive offer doesn’t mean higher salary it means a higher bid from a PSG, RM, MC type team. where did you get massive offer=higher salary? Nothing to do with higher salary like you said, if Juve get offered insane X-amount of money for someone like Pogba (quality player, interest from big teams, big money) they might be “forced” to sell because of the financial benefits it would have, it would be foolish not to. It could mean a higher salary for Pogba but that is beside the point and the quote deals to transfer fee.
This whole thing is foolish for two reasons his quote has NOTHING to do with Pogba he just mentioned his name because he’s a young player who has the appeal and skill that attract big money teams as it has been evident in Serie A. He named him as an example he could’ve said Vidal for all I care and the example still holds. The other reason is because there are current talks ongoing with Pogba and his agent to extend his contract, clearly Juve have no issue in dealing with this situation and it isn’t an issue, rightfully increasing his salary and extending his contract beyond 2016 which is beneficial for all parties. Other Juve players are going through contract negotiations as well.
Sometimes examples are just examples, if there were problems with Pogba and contract issues then I would look more into the situation, but there aren’t and things are overall pretty good. This is getting old.",cugino1897 ,"Oct 10, 2013 ", 7:49 PM,

His rhetoric over the last 3 years has always been that of financial prudence, economic stability, yada, yada, yada. I think he’s trying to note that some talent is difficult to retain.
I’m definitely not an advocate of selling Polpo, as clearly he hasn’t even reached anywhere near his potential, and he’s already borderline world class. HOWEVER, I am also not an unreasonable individual, and if I were in his shoes, a massive offer of something like €80m+, might get me to change my mind. To put that in perspective, that would literally be 1/3rd of the clubs revenue for a single season.
Also, on an aside, yet still related to the overall theme…I’ve been reading all these comments about what Vidal is worth, Pogba, etc. I think we are all a little bit over zealous after that Bale transfers. Let’s get one thing straight, Bale is, was, and never will be (realistically) worth €100m. The fact is Real way overpaid and they know it. They just wanted him that badly and Tottenham did some brilliant negotiating. They knew that Real would essentially pay any price, and they made it triple digits. I digress…point being is that we must stop using this Bale transfer as the barometer for what other players are worth. It was a unique one off situation.

The only other major reason to move would be club prestige, so that would leave RM, Barca, Bayern and Man United from possible destinations. United is in after-Fergie phase and they had problems with buying anyone last transfer window, let alone someone like Vidal so they are out of the contention. Vidal already turned down Bayern so that leaves them out too. This makes only Barca and Real a viable destinations, but Barca already have Busquets playing that role and Mascherano covering, so they aren’t a likely place Vidal would go.

Last year, after shameful episodes of racist chants/behaviours by some supporters (expecially against Balo and from Lazio’s fan), the FIGC released new rules on punishment for racism and “territorial discrimination”. The non-sense of this new rules are that the behaviour of some fans might affect heavily the team, not only by fines and stadiums bans.
The question is:
Is fair that few ultras can ban an entire stadium (this happens even with UEFA rules)?
What if some ultras put on the opposing team shirt and earn a lose by default (or a relegation to Serie B thanks to this new rules)?
Is fair that a team active against the racism are punished because of some else behaviours? It’s like being punished for the crime of your cousin.
I fear that a group of Inter-Merda fans can buy a ticket for a Juventus match only for damaging our team

The racist taunting is a prelude to violence. It will also kill the Italian game eventually. What talented black player will elect to play in such a degrading atmosphere ? I predict Pogba will leave Italy as soon as he can, and once he’s gone, he’ll open up about how sick he became of the racist thugs in the stands.
On the other hand, your point is well taken. Why should the many be punished for the sins of the few ?
The only solution I see is for the clubs to crack down with a zero tolerance policy. Heavy investment needed in stadium security to extinguish the problems immediately wherever they pop up and kick out the offending “fans” right away – no second chances. Requires lots of very well trained security guards to carry it out. One monkey pantomime, and six yellow jacketed security police, all bigger than the thug, appear immediately to restrain and forcibly carry out the offender, toss him in a holding cell (like the Cleveland Browns’ “drunk tank”) until the crowds have left and then press criminal charges for which the guy has to hire a lawyer and probably pay a fine. Warn fans of these consequences on the back of the ticket, which is a license. Anyone objects to that risk, he can watch the match at home on TV. Zero tolerance works.

*Disclaimer: I have never travelled to Italy and don’t know any non-American Italians, so the following is completely speculative.
The real solution is to change the cultural acceptance of racism in the entire society. If such expressions are as pervasive in the stadia as the news reports would seem to indicate, they cannot be any less pervasive in the society in general. The reason they are trying to crack down so severely on the fans is because of the high profile and international attention the games receive; it is embarrassing for these ‘retrograde ideas’ to be broadcast to the world.

For me that is where the issue lies. They are doing this to give the appearance of things being done, but nothing is being to try and change actually whatever fucked up archaic ideas people have. Basically they don’t want their dirty laundry out there but if it does get seen, the reaction is “look we truly are cracking down on it, and these things are being done to fight it”. For things to change truly they hay to change top-to-bottom, they won’t change because fans are banned from a stadium a deeper change has to occur or these problems will persist.
A lot of the ultra racist behavior is because they know that they will get a reaction from a player and because well, they can. Some might not really care about the color of the player’s skin but do it because they know it will “get” to the players.

"Juventus' internationals: Where are they, and when are they playing?",Danny Penza,"Oct 8, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"Some facts:
Italian stadiums isn’t property of the clubs but of municipalities. Clubs cannot invest in stadium renovation or security, and cannot avoid punishment with countermeasures.
There’s already a “Zero-Tolerance” policy. But not all the tickets are nominal (seat=name+surname), and in old stadiums isn’t easy control the crow (poor security mobility and poor CCTV view angles). So for FICG the clubs are responsable
The line between a “sfottò” (tease) and “territorial discrimination” is thin. Who decide? Not a judge but the federal delegates that can sign or omit a report. So Milan was fined for “We are not Neapolitans” chants during the match with Juventus but Inter wasn’t fined for the same chant plus a “Napoletani …colerosi, terremotati… che col sapone non vi siete mai lavati” (i don’t translate but is referred to last cholera epidemy in ’73).
It isn’t only a question of stadium ban: few organized people can ruin financially a club. After the 3rd episode the club lose the match on the table and after the 4th is penalized of some points.
The question is: are these new rules fair?
PS: Another concrete example of tease fined as racism: after an Eccellenza match (6th tier of FIGC pyramid) of my county, Mori VS Eppan, a Mori player was banned for 10 matches for the phrase “crucco di merda” (fucking “kraut”). The cherry on the top: opposite insults like “scheiße walschen” (fucking “Italian”, in reality a term like kraut for italians) wasn’t recognized by the referee, a Venetian Italian-only speaker.

"Juventus' internationals: Where are they, and when are they playing?",Danny Penza,"Oct 8, 2013, 6:00am PDT",,"I feel like by banning a whole group of people where it might have been a few shitheads you end up antagonizing more people than necessary. You damage the club, people in that section who had nothing to do, other fans in the stadium and the image of Serie A. Sure there are deeper problems in Italy and the ultras have problems themselves also but if you hold single people accountable and ban the perpetrators I feel like the ultras would at the very least abstain from this behavior and not promote in the stadiums out of fear of being fined and banned themselves and would eventually fizzle out (ideally).
If you ban the whole curva the mindset is “Who cares? We’ll ALL come back for the next game.” There aren’t really any repercusions aside from not being able to attend a game. Not having one person accountable the whole guilt is spread out between everyone and they all feel guilt-free and that nothing was wrong. Isn’t there a name for this phenomenon, like when a mob acts out they don’t feel guilty since everyone is doing it?
The clubs and the league need to work together to use whatever technology or means available in stadiums to track down, fine and ban the people that do this. I’m sure the clubs would oblige since thy’re the ones that have to pay for the fines. Why don’t they do this???
It’s good when things are implemented to create a better atmosphere, and remove racism from the sport but things could be done in a much better way, regardless of the deeper problems in Italy and elsewhere. If things are to improve in this regard they should start higher up and not in sports. In this case the “territorial discrimination” fine seems a bit off if what was reported was true and don’t really disagree with the Milan officials complaining about it. Also it’s weird that general dickishness, banter or whatever you want to call it would be on par with racism chants.

But clubs are instead worried about losing support from the ultras.

While Agnelli was more considered in his responses, saying that the current format needed to be looked at and that the Europa League especially required revitalisation, Aysal was far more expansive.

uhmm, duh? of course there’s always the possibility of ANY players being sold. This is a football club, not a dungeon. from the 5 heroes that helped us get out of Serie B (Camo, Buffon, ADP, Nedved and Trez) Who would’ve thought that only Nedved and Buffon stayed, and not Del Piero? Marchisio and Buffon threatened to leave once in a while. Of course they didn’t say “omfg juve sux I want to join petrodollars club”, But I remember correctly that they hinted that poor management will make them reconsider their stay at Juventus. I also heard something about Camo regretted his stay at Juve, but I don’t have enough information to comment on that. Bottom line, Agnelli better make things right with what could be potentially the world’s best midfielder within 3 years. Till this day, We HAVEN’T extend his 0.6 mil/annum contract yet.
We all know that in the same interview Pogba said “I don’t see myself at clubs other than juventus”. combine the quote with “Juve for life? Certain promises do not make sense, how can I today know where I will spend my entire career? It doesn’t make sense.”, you get a possibility of him staying for a long time IF you treat him right. I can only have closure after he have a glorious 13-15 spells with Juve, he can go back to france or some small asian clubs. this one of the reason why I had my closure with ADP: he is always a Juventino, unlike Zidane which when someone mention Zidane, Real Madrid is associated to him more than Juventus despite his ballon d’or was won in black and white.
I just don’t want to be a second class citizen in europe, or a joke selling club like Arsenal or Milan that despite their financial strength, struggle to win anything, especially when we have the capability of being the best, the europe mentality is the only thing missing.

Attachment to the club is the only thing keeping players on teams now since insane amounts of money have been thrown around these last years.
The quote from Andrea isn’t comforting I agree, but it’s a realistic quote from a business point-of-view. The thing is there aren’t many things pointing out to Pogba wanting to leave or the club wanting to sell him soon.

He was also at a business conference it wasn’t talking to some reporter dude outside a Juve HQ, setting does matter… Here are his words via @Adz77, Adam Digby.
The President said;

“We have to lift the whole system as we’re still stuck in no man’s land. We spend most of the time debating about how money should be spent instead of how Italian football should be developing internationally. Football has the chance to be a leader in the Italian political situation as it’s followed by half of the country. A sense of responsibility, vision and discipline should be applied to that.

“If we look at what Serie A used to represent, 10 to 15 years ago, it was the dream place to play for international footballers. When I studied in England Serie A football was broadcast here and people were talking about it wherever you went.

“It was a different era, though, and things have changed. The Premier League back then wasn’t what it is today. Elsewhere, the German game has been growing for 10 years. They’ve had a technical plan, worked together with the federation and hosted the World Cup. Spain has two of the most successful global brands. France is kicking on with foreign investment. If I was to judge it from a footballer’s point of view, Serie A is no longer the final port of call but a transit destination.

“If we got a massive offer for someone like Pogba, the French twenty year old, would we be able to retain him? I don’t know. Look at Milan, they had to let Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva go. Yes, you can be an attractive club, but you also need to have the economic strength to compete.”

Juventus 3:2 Milan - Juve continue to struggle and win,ivoandov,"Oct 7, 2013, 1:32am PDT",,"I agree with her to some extent, but it’s hard for me to give one one specific answer since situations differ from player to player (Raul, ADP, etc.) BUT in this case I guess the situation was “set” when ADP signed that last one year contract which I think had the promise of “re-evaluating things” at the end of the season. So I guess what was going to happen was known for a year before and I was getting ready for it.
I agree with her that no player is bigger than the team and this definitely applies to the case of Alex retiring, now when I’m trying to put into words what I think about the situation, I realize that I never really made up mind about it. Things just kind of happened the Scudetto was won, Atalanta match was very emotional and then the Coppa Italia was lost so there was a lot going on. I was angry that Alex’s sending off was the loss though.
I wasn’t angry towards Agnelli and Co, or at Alex for moving on. Its harder for us fans when we’re attached to players especially if they have the importance that ADP had for Juve. I find it hard to blame Agnelli and the management for in their minds wanting to do what’s best for the team (again trying to be objective separate fan and business, doesn’t mean I would have acted the same). Of course I am torn because it meant to effectively say goodbye to my favorite player which I had been there pretty much ever since I followed Juve. I also find it hard to blame Alex for wanting more to his career and be an ambassador in way in a different league. I think he still had more to give clearly and as a professional he still has hunger and gas in his tank for more but again don’t know if he had space at Juve for this (not me but trying to be objective) or if he would’ve like to have stayed strictly as a locker room figure and not get much playing time which I assume he would’ve been unhappy about.
The whole rumors of bad blood thing… I don’t really remember exactly what happened. Vaguely remember reading that Alex effectively “found out” he was going to go through the media or that from the announcement was given in a press conference and he left or something like that. I have a hard time believing that the decision made was something that had not been thoroughly discussed or even worse a “surprise” to the parties involved. Whether or not what is said to have happened and what actually happened and was said between Alex and the management is up for debate and we may never really know for sure. Perhaps there was an issue is was due to the way the announcement was given and there might have been some disconnect there. Knowing Alex he’s probably too classy to say a negative word about the whole thing and Juve would probably save themselves the drama by saying anything bad as well. I think this is the part where most people are upset at what went down.
Whatever happened I don’t doubt that Alex will come back sooner or later but don’t really know when. At a club like Juve great players have stepped down after long careers and the team has managed, no disrespect to Alex, it was the player of our generation to do so. I have seen fans here and elsewhere say things like “Agnelli/Conte will always be remembered as those guilty of Alex leaving” and things like that and it’s just foolish to me, but you can disagree with me and that’s fine. As a fan I “get it” but things like this have happened before I just wasn’t around when they happened.
Ideally what would have happened? I guess the Coppa won/loss and Alex retires and becomes a Nedved-type figure for the management or basically this happens one year later with him having a very minimal role. I still think he had a good sending off and probably of the most emotional sports moments experienced.
TL;DR: I ramble on and realize I was relatively ok with the situation, specific details might never come out and I’m fine with what happened now given the circumstances but was of course an emotional moment. Turned out longer than I set out and came out the same. Also…HA Chucks is gonna be jealous.",cugino1897 ,"Oct 7, 2013 ", 5:11 PM,
Juventus 3:2 Milan - Juve continue to struggle and win,ivoandov,"Oct 7, 2013, 1:32am PDT",,"Interesting read. I think there’s definitely a lot of opinionated folk in regards to how that whole saga played out.
From a more personal standpoint, I started following calcio in early ‘09, so I’d consider myself a “new” fan compared to a lot of other readers/comments around the BWRAO-sphere….I have the utmost respect for our eternal Capitano, but his departure wasn’t as emotional for me, solely based on the fact that I never really had the pleasure of watching him play his entire career at Juve. That being said, I don’t view him leaving the team as a personal “snub” by the Juve management. I agree with Mina to the extent that Angelli was probably trying to do two things; 1. Initiate and perhaps send a message in regards to the “changing of the guard” 2. Show that we were more focused on the future of the club as opposed to re signing a 38 y/o player (objectively speaking).
As far as how Ale felt in regards to the situation, we may never actually know the truth there. Even if he did feel betrayed by the club (which I DON’T think is the truth), he probably wouldn’t have expressed it because he’s way too classy for that.

If any young players, they make the best mentor. you should not only count their age, you should also count the new fans they bring to the team. They are attached to them. they buy jerseys with their name of them. they are one of the reasons to attend the stadium.
When the age starts getting the best of them (not what I see in Totti), they should still be given new contract because they are STILL important to fans, and fans are important for the club’s finance. When they retire, a new job should be offered to them (like zidane, nedved or inzaghi). Jerseys sales won’t be as attractive (something that few italian clubs really tap into) if players come and go like a grocery stores. look at ManU and how they build their marketing tentacles with the class of 90’s or Barca with their homegrown players. getting rid of Del Piero & Zidane was a mistake if you ask me given how attractive they are for the team.",Marotta ,"Oct 8, 2013 ", 12:07 AM,

I was going to write a long match review but I’ll keep this one as short as possible. To sum it all up this was clearly a less than spectacular performance in which we did just enough to get a win. I really can’t stress how much we need to stop conceding these ridiculous goals. Not sure if it’s a lack of concentration, focus, or simply our players trying to “overdo” things (instead of sticking to the simple things, LIKE CLEARING THE BALL away from the penalty box). I’ll continue and say that if we don’t fix this issue, we will have some serious issues.
As for individual players performances, no one man really stood out. Asamoah must have been reading this blog and decided to start cutting in and shooting on his right, lol. Not sure I agree with Pirlo’s 8 rating. True, he had a goal and half (if you will), but his errant passing really irks me. I just don’t understand what was up with him and Vidal last night…never have two of our best players made SO many absurd turnovers or failed to complete the simplest of passes.
I’ll end it with this: On paper we certainly have one of the better squads in Europe (and are stronger than last season), but I think all of us Juventini know that this team is really built around grinta, and performing as a unit. Right now there seems to be a rampant lack of concentration/determination, as well as far too much individualism and not enough team cohesion. Things could have turned out a lot worse this season in general based on how we’ve been playing, so I think we should consider ourselves to be in a fairly good position only 2 points off the Serie A leaders, and still having a strong chance of advancing past the group stages.

Juventus 3 - AC MIlan 2: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 6, 2013, 3:15pm PDT",I'm having second thought about 3-5-2,"I kinda agree with JD when he said a formation influences how a team play, how they attack, how they defend, how they move off the ball, and how they transition the play between attacking and defending. Our defense was amongst the best in the world in the last two season, but teams also found out how to unlock them, and our attack… we created a lot of scoring chances but that’s that, chances, teams seems confident enough sitting deep when playing against Juve.
It’s an exaggeration to suggest that there’s a crisis in Juventus, but on the same time not everything is okay, not everything went according to plan, so there’s no need to change everything… just the game plan, the formation. Some might think that the thought of changing the formation is already a radical thought, but I disagree… teams with high fluidity like Juve, where strikers defend and defenders attack, changing formation is not a radical move, moreover with the players able to shapeshift from 3-5-2 to any formation without even subbing players, but on the same time… they seem to have no extra options in the final third than crosses and dummy flicks or one two passes.
Gio’s goal last night made me think, what if Juve play with wingers up front like what Conte’s team used to? It doesn’t matter, natural wingers, inverted wingers, it’ll give us more option in the final third, with natural wingers we can deploy Llorente to finish their crosses, with inverted wingers we can deploy Tevez on the not-so-wide left area to do the Del Piero, there will be more options and thats what we need now.
Anyone followed Antoine Griezmann? Is he any good? Rumors has it, Juve are interested in bringing him to Turin. Also Adnan Januzaj sounds like a Pogba like prospect, but I doubt Man U would let anyone from their ranks go for free after Pogba; It’s time for Conte to scrap that “I only have Pepe”.",Linez ,"Oct 6, 2013 ", 11:45 PM,

Juventus 3 - AC MIlan 2: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 6, 2013, 3:15pm PDT",,"I don’t know whether it’s right for me to chip in here, but I thought I’d explain myself more, considering that Linez mentioned my name above.
In short, when I say we need to consider another formation (namely the 4-3-3-), what I have in mind is that the mentality, the pressure, the way we defend and the way we attack would be similar to our current system. The only difference is how the men line up during phases of the game; i.e. how close/far will our players stand relative to their direct oppositions. What I find is that with 3-5-2, our players have to make further runs to cover space, especially in Europe where teams play with natural width. It makes it difficult to cover the space and to pressure up the pitch.
A simple hypothetical analysis, sort of prediction, on how the obvious favourites in Europe play, and how we would fare with 3-5-2:
- A club like Bayern is our worst nightmare, because they have world class wingers cutting in, and behind them world class fullbacks providing width. They can easily maintain possession by passing the ball back to their FBs. We have to double team their wingers, meaning our wingback is pulled back, and consequently our side CMs need to close down their FB, who remained wide most of the time.
- Real is similarly a scary prospect, because they also have superb wingers. The only downside to Real is that their RB (in Arbeloa) is not a world class FB. Having said that, he’d still serve a purpose to maintain possession, although maybe he won’t offer much of an attacking threat by his own.
- Barca, surprisingly, might be one opponent which we can live with. Their natural instinct to play down the middle suits our style, albeit they still have the quality to rip through any defense on their average-to-good day. Having said that, they do have marauding fullbacks in Jordi Alba and Dani Alves, which will punish teams that fail to recognize their threat out wide. When the opponent gets too concerned over the space in the middle, they bomb forward and suddenly space appear in the middle when opposing defenders frantically try to cover the empty space out wide, stretching the defense thin.
In short, facing these teams, we’ll be outmanned out wide. We need those fullbacks pressed if we want to enjoy possession.",JDAngkasa ,"Oct 7, 2013 ", 1:02 AM,

Juventus 3 - AC MIlan 2: Initial reaction and random observations,Danny Penza,"Oct 6, 2013, 3:15pm PDT",My Personal Post-Match Thoughts,"1. Great and important win for us. I ALWAYS prefer to have a cleansheet. however, if we must concede 1st, I prefer playing from behind rather than giving up the lead. this quality will be important later on in both Serie A and CL knock out stage
2. I don’t think we make more errors this season compared to the previous ones. However, the difference was last seasons when someone made a mistake, we were fast to build up a good defense (credit especially to Vidal and Barzagli) to prevent counter attack. Lately when someone like Pogba and Isla made mistakes the players go “uhm, at least we have someone to point finger to”. When pogba tried to be cute and lost the ball to three milan players, I didn’t see the vintage Vidal tackle or divine Barzagli clearance. not trying to defend Pogba for his unnecessary errors, but the amazing defensive records not only came from individual strengths, the collective work and off the ball movements were crucial.
3. That Pogba’s error, so unnecessary. I get it that he is ambitious, but he gave millions of juve fans a heart attack. Lucky that we didn’t get punished by this, but as one of biased Pogba fan, he MUST learn to avoid mistakes like this in the future. great showing overall as RWB, though. hope this won’t destroy Isla’s confidence even further.
4. On the other hand, Giovinco Mamma mia!!! what a dribble, what a finish. everyone on twitter called for conte’s head for bringing him in instead of Llorente, but he proved us wrong. been a while (I think the last time was Away Donetsk’ game in CL) since he is crucial score-wise for the team. Hope he keep his head down (no pun intended) and continue improving.
5. Overall, this subpar performances have a lot to do with extremely hard pre-season training and new tactical approaches. instead of the usual possession football, we are trying to play long balls, set pieces and involving BBC more into attacks among other things. the squad looked awkward at times and more errors allowed. give conte some time, he will make things right for us.
6. The only real problem I see is the play from the wings. Conte just doesn’t trust anyone enough to play a dedicated attacking winger. IMO in the squad Pogba, Isla and Tevez are capable of injecting energy from the flanks but I believe we’ll sort this problem out eventually, the question is when. Maybe we will buy new winger, Maybe we will wait for Pepe (our only NATURAL winger). But one thing is certain: we will find solutions and alternatives. I hope it’s not too late because we can’t afford to get out of CL’s group stage.",Marotta ,"Oct 7, 2013 ", 12:44 AM,
