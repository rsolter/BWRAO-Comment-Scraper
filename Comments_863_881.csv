I doubt that Seria A will ever adopt La Liga model. Perhaps one solution would be to force lower leagues (B to C2) to field a minimum of U-21 players. One has to wonder also why the current system in Italy. Primavera matches have really low attendance and are barely covered by the press, then one has to wonder why this system? this serves who? Unfortunately I believe that while in the Italian youth leagues there are several true talented players, there are also far too many recommended players, children of wealthy families and/or with special connections, perhaps I'm wrong but there is definitely something wrong with the present model.",gigar ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 12:32 AM,

Do you think Juve's loans really work out ? (not considering Amauri :P) I know it worked for Giovinco and Marchisio but they seem like exceptional cases. Is the club thinking hard enough before loaning a youngster or are they loaning out players for the sake of loaning out ?",Somnath_Sengupta ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 12:50 AM,
Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"I definitely would love it if everyone played their Primavera in the league pyramid. It wouldn't be exclusively Serie B, not at all. Barcelona and Villarreal are the only two teams with their B team in the 2nd division. Even playing 17-18 year olds in Serie C1 would be a huge improvement in the quality of opposition than the Primavera campionato.


It would be a radical and huge transition. And difficult to do. If there's one takehome lesson for me from the betting scandal going on right now, it's that players have it very, very rough in the lower divisions of Italian soccer. And I'm sure playing against kids would make it worse, not just from a standpoint of “I have to play kids?” but financially it would push a lot of players out and make the competition for them even harder.",agiamba ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 1:00 AM,
Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"Loans are decent solutions for players like Amauri to go out and raise their market value. I don't think they're generally a good solution for young players, people may rage a bit about the co-ownership model, but I think it's best for all parties involved. For clubs receiving the player, if they do okay, they stay. If they do great, the club gets a financial boost, it gives them a greater incentive to play the youngsters.


I think both with co-ownerships and loans, the structure of the agreements is not nearly as important as picking the right team for them, and I cannot stress that enough. Giovinco to Parma was excellent. The team gave him certain assurances, it plays young players, and he fits into the system. Sending them out to a team for the sake of sending them out is awful. If you send a player out like Iago to Bari where there's no modular fit, that's terrible even if they play young kids. Or if you send Immobile to Siena- a team that plays young kids (under Conte) but is already fully set on attackers, that's no good either.

It's like guns. Co-ownerships and loans don't kill young players development, sending them to the wrong place does.",agiamba ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 1:05 AM,

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"I absolutely love posts that are made in regards to giving youth players a shot. Everyone who knows me on twitter knows that I am probably one of the worlds biggest Pasquato supporters. That kid, whether you like it or not, is an absolute star in the making, and just last night I was discussing with Aaron regarding his trade for Matri. That if he was sold along with Marrone and Immobile for full-ownership then I think Marotta got his 3rd strike from me (1st being Caceras, 2nd being selling Trez then buying Toni).

In any case, not to self-promote or anything but here is a post I made a long time ago, regarding youth in Juve and how we dealt with them before and now:

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"I'm not disagreeing with you but,despite Iago only playing primavera he still did pretty good in the Segunda with Villareal.The problem is that coaches don't trust youngsters enough in Italy.

Look at someone like Theo Walcott,not necessarily the most talented player in the world,but by 16 he was a regular with Southampton in the championship.If memory serves me right,wasn't Giovinco setting the primavera alight when he was a teenager?Why couldn't we loan him out to someone like Modena and insert a clause that states he needs to play a certain amount of games?Sure it'll be difficult to get the club to budge but it's worth a try.

Another thing don't Italian clubs have any reserve teams?They do in England and Spain.In England,unlike Spain,they've got a special reserve league.How come there's no such thing in Italy?It's bloody stupid to read about a senior player,who's recovering from an injury,trying to get match time by playing with the primavera's(see De Ceglie).

The idea of the U21's playing in Serie B is a clever one.It's actually how it works in Malaysia and the U21's are definitely capable of holding their own and Malaysia has produced some decent young players the past 3 years or so.So why not?",AlbionArks ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 2:06 AM,

Because the only way you could make a Serie B team (most Serie B teams are teams with limited resources in an extremely difficult league to stay in [teams with 50pt seasons get relegated, go figure], let alone try to move up so gambling is not usually an option for them) play your typical unproven, in-desperate-need-of-playing-time, 19-20 year old youngster whose real potential is still a question mark is by paying them. Either you tell them “here, I'll pay you but please give this kid some game time” or you sell them half of his rights so they have some kind of asset in their hands which they need to care for and build up. Other than that, they have no real obligation to give him playtime.
Once again, I'm talking about your average Primavera youngster who has a combined 90 minutes of professional play time max at the age of 19 or 20, not your one-of-a-kind talent a la Stephan El Shaarawy (who I'd love to see at Juve and would be cool with Marotta spending big money for).

For example, look at Ciro Immobile's case. Looked very good at the Viareggios, did a very good job in the Primavera championship but his real ability was yet to be seen. After not getting much playtime from Siena (unfortunate but understandable since Siena was one of Serie B's most talented teams and guys like Calaio` and Mastronunzio are experienced, proven Serie B journeymen), he was loaned out midway to Grossetto, a team with much lower expectations. The offensive talent at Grossetto was far less impressive than that at the promotion-fighting Siena but Ciro still didn't get a ton of playtime. Why? Because Grossetto was fighting not to get relegated by that time and barely missed the play-out. They wanted Immobile on loan because they thought he could be a good option to the first team but when you're clawing for points week in and week out and you're staring at Lega Pro, how can you be convinced to give this unproven kid the consistent amount of playtime needed for him to start performing? The average youngster needs a lot of possibilities, faith, time, patience in order to get going, many never even do and no Serie B manager/DS is stupid enough to risk relegation just to give a youngster or two they have no direct control over a chance.",jorid22 ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 3:10 AM,

but his dealings in regards to a good number of the youngsters he found
owned by the club were terrible.

Immobile=sent from one team with massive expectations and little room for mistakes to the next in one season.
Iago=after a season going to waste for him, he was sent on loan at nearly 20 in the Spanish Segunda while Villarreal was given a dirt-poor purchase option as part of the deal.
Pinsoglio and Merlano=two young goalkeepers who came through the youth system, both sent to the same fucking Lega Pro Prima Divisione club…fucking really, Beppe? Not trying to pass either of them for the new Lev Yashin (Pinsoglio is the younger of the two and definitely the more talented but even he still has a lot of work to do before he turns out anything worth noting) but this shit just makes no sense.
Giovinco=whether you think Seba is a whiny midget or just a mistreated talent, whether you think he's the second coming of the messiah or nothing more than the new Domenico Morfeo, he's worth more than 7 million altogether. In a realistic market, he's worth 8-9, shit, maybe even 10 million, in a market with ridiculously inflated prices where guys like Pozzo, Zamparini and Preziosi love shooting for the fucking moon on a regular he's worth much more. If Pozzo says that Sanchez is worth 40 million Euros, Giovinco is worth 20. If Pozzo will settle for 30 million cash for Alexis, Marotta needs to settle for 15 million cash for Giovinco. Yet according to the latest rumor, Conte now wants Giovinco back, Pietro Leonardi made it clear that Parma will buy half of his rights and that they have no intention of giving up on him easily as he's believed to be an important part of the squad for next season and now Marotta might have to begin negotiating with Parma and offering them players and money just to convince them to pass up on exercising the exact same purchase clause that he himself made available to Parma 12 months ago simply to get a Juve-owned player back.",jorid22 ,"Jun 12, 2011 ", 3:36 AM,

Just because a 19 year old is a “promising” player from Juve's Primavera, he's not automatically good enough to play in a Serie B team.

6. Profit!

Young players would grow far better that way but FIGC (Federazione Italiana Gioco Corrotto) would never allow it.

They are far more concerned helping calcio grow by limiting non-EU player numbers because you know, finding a South American born player who's also an EU passport holder or with the necessary ancestry to eventually become an EU passport holder is really hard.

However…I am yet to see what we have truly missed out upon, in terms of your example of Iago. For what has he gone on to achieve, as of now? Is he been courted by decent teams eager to thrust him into their first team squad? I stick to the old adage 'if you are good enough, you are old enough'…you mention Immobile, and yet how did he fare this season? You mention MArrone, who played a solid, but far from season long part, of a promotion winning team in Serie B.

Our ONLY youngster who seems to have excelled whilst out on loan this last season is…Pasquato.And I highly doubt we will sell him outright; likely send him out on co-ownership or another loan. As a left wing forward, where would he fit in to our present squad? With DP, Martinez, Quag, also potentially Bastos…and even Pepe…to contend with??

YES, i understand and agree with the problem, of assuming that youngsters can simply never be ready for the first team squad until 22+…but this season, where we have seen the steady inclusion and blossoming of Sorenson, the sporadic appearances of Giondanato and Boniperti…it seems less a heavy issue than some could suggest.

I am massively in favour of giving youth a chance, but if they cannot truly excel whilst on loan at other clubs, fighting for, and playing if worthy, competitive league action…then what else can we do with them?

Paratici seems to know what he is doing…sorenson, magnusson, that giant romanian keeper, branescu?, camillieri, ilari…the appelt brothers. So…I see us in good hands, presently, when it comes to procuring promising youngsters and suggesting them for the first team squad…and as for our primavera team, how have they fared in their league? and how did they fare in the viareggio tournament??? Lets raid Varese!!!

either way…a wicked post, mate. Once that inspires much mental turmoil…keep up the good work, and as always, forza Juve.

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"Re: the Giovinco situation.

I just thought I'd make a few points regarding bringing Seba back.

Firstly, I don't think ANY footballer in the world, not even Messi, can demand a starting spot. It's up to the coach to decide who plays. Now, I really believe that if Giovinco is convinced that he's part of the Juve project, then he would return even if he knew he'd be competing with Krasic, Quagliarella, DP and (say) Bastos for a place in the starting 11. For a player who can play on either wing and as a trequartista, there's always room. Let's not forget, however, that under Ferrara and Zac, Giovinco was clearly not part of the coach's vision. In the absence of Diego, these coaches chose players like Candreva and De Ceglie (and a subsequent change of formation) rather than simply replace Diego with Giovinco.

On the other hand, at Parma, Giovinco is clearly enjoying his football. He knows he'll start every week, play in his favorite position, has the entire team built around him, and is subsequently a favorite to be chosen for La Nazionale at Euro 2012. However, he knows he won't win trophies with Parma, so he WILL eventually leave them. It might just be too tempting not to do it just yet, and to continue playing without worrying about competition within the squad for a place in the starting 11.

The most likely outcome I envision is that Seba will continue with Parma for another season, just to be sure he's selected for Euro 2012, and will, in all likelihood, seek a return to Juve at the start of next season.",Rinaldo2882 ,"Jun 13, 2011 ", 2:20 AM,

Chiellini is very good but Bonucci is not there yet and Barzagli is approaching the twilight of his career. We're even looking at the possibility of adding another very good CB.

In Italy, only Thiago Silva, Nesta, and (maybe) Lucio are better than him. Outside of Italy, there are Pique, Puyol and Vidic I rate ahead of Chiellini. He's on par or slightly better than Terry, Ferdinand, and Vincent Kompany. Those are my top ten (Of the younger CBs, I like David Luiz, Chelsea; Hummels and Subotic, Dortmund).

From the top ten, Nesta, Lucio, Puyol, Terry and Ferdinand are on the wrong side of 30 so next season we will (hopefully) see him as one of the top five CBs in the world.

So I don't think Juve will let him go even for 50mil. It's not that he's worth 50, but we'll be dead without him. In three or four years, when Bonucci is more mature and developed and more very good CBs have come, maybe. But certainly not now.",dwicarta ,"Jun 13, 2011 ", 10:33 AM,

First, we're almost in the same boat as last year with no decent subs for our wingers and our second striker. So that we would have to change the system with every injury… For instance Quagliarella because Del Piero hasn't got the physique to pressure the opposing midfielders…

If Vucinic would come in, we wouldn't have that problem, because he can play both striker roles and both the winger positions.

Ok, he's not the Rossi or Sanchez bread, but he's quality and I'd prefer having 2 very good players over one too bloody expensive “champion” who can get injured and leaves us empty handed once again.

dwicarta, i really like what you said about the mental characteristics of a champion. you are 100% right that, talent-wise, a very good player could be on the same level as a champion, but the champions have that something extra that pushes them to higher levels.

the only thing i question is whether rossi, sanchez or aguero fit that definition of champion. fact is, they haven't won anything yet. however, there is no doubt that their potential is immense.

krasic-sanchez-vargas can flexibly rotate and interchange. Indeed Sanchez has not won anything yet but his kind of talent is rare. Skill, speed, vision for killer passes, burst of pace, ability to suddenly accelerate and stop and change direction, and it's very hard to get the ball from his feet. We'll make that sudden jump in quality with Sanchez in our squad.

Let's say Sanchez-Vargas will cost 30+13=43mil. Bastos-Vucinic? We're looking at 15+18=33mil.

So you have Sanchez+Vargas on one hand and Bastos+Vucinic+10mil on the other. Which one do you choose? If we have that extra 10mil, I'd take the first in a heartbeat. If I don't have that extra 10mil, I'd sell a few players and get that 10mil I need.",dwicarta ,"Jun 13, 2011 ", 1:27 PM,

I think if the player has a choice he will push for either Inter or Barcelona (Juve are not in such a good bargaining position right now).

On top of that Pozzo has apparently rejected a 35m offer from Inter for Sanchez, so I think if we are to make the deal quickly then we need to come up with 40m. And Vargas for 13m is a dream. I don't see Corvino letting him go for less than 18. So the difference is 33m vs 58m, so we need to come up with an extra 25m to bring both Vargas and Sanchez. So, unless we have a plan to put Secco in charge of Man City so he can buy Amauri for 25m there is not way we have the cash.

In my opinion, Sanchez is not worth 40m, Pozzo just knows there are crazy people out there who will be ok overspending so he will milk it. Given the fact that Sanchez has had some spectacular 6 months I think he is worth maybe 25m on a good day.

I understand why everyone wants a champion and why Moggi keeps saying 2-3 champions are better than 6 good players, but based on the last 2 seasons, I'd say we still haven't got the foundation upon which champions will be able to win us anything. Players like Vargas, Bastos and Lichsteiner are the ones who will strengthen the positions we really lack in at the moment. Look at it this way, teams like Atletico, Udinese, Villareal, they all had that one player who was either a champion or potential champion, but they aren't challenging for honours cos they never had the truly strong foundation

I know people will probably bash me for this, but I still think we need another season, provided we approach this summer correctly. If not, and Marotta goes and blows all his money on another Martinez, or doesn't manage to get rid of Motta after buying him then we should all mutiny.

However, don't underestimate the marketing and psychological impact big signings can have on a team and its fanbase. Look at how packed AC Milan games were after the signing of Ibra and Robinho. Fans want to see stars. Period.

A single player can have that effect too. The move to bring Beckham to LA was a huge marketing gamble but it payed off in press coverage and bringing in people to the stadium who wouldn't have come otherwise no matter how good the Galaxy were playing.

Wow, what an astute and insightful observation. I never thought of that.

Robee, I agree with you that we need depth in the squad and that winning games is what its all about. But don't overlook the fact that this is a business. The management will be closely tracking season ticket sales and it WILL have a direct impact on this and next summer's mercatos. That is a simple business fact. A big marque signing will be a big boost to those ticket sales.

Season ticket sales should be important to every Juve fan as that directly relates to match day revenue. Wouldn't it be nice if we were in a position like Arsenal and their huge match revenue?

However, injuries are inevitable and that's why we need good subs. I'm not disagreeing with you on this. But again, my point is Sanchez is one of a kind talent that you don't find every year. I'd rather we add have one world-class and one very good players instead of three very good players. If we run out of money and the squad is still thin in quantity, I'll reinforce the next season. Why? Because there are many, many more very good players than the world-class ones.

Moreover, we've done the quantity phase this past season, and for better of worse, this is now the time to get into the quality phase. If, God forbid, injury strikes, then we'll have to live with it and add more quality the following season. To me, that's how you build winning teams.

For me a real champion that is on the market right now is Carlitos Tevez. I think he will kill the Italian league with his ability and he can bring any team at least 2 positions ahead in the standings if the team is properly built. So, if we are aiming for 3rd place, buying Tevez can make us scudetto contenders.

With that being said, I don't think Man City will let him go for anything less than 35-40m. On top of that he has talked for the last 2 years about retiring from football altogether because he is sick and tired about all the commercialism of the sport. So, spending 40m on a player that will play for 2 years and then retire is a poor business plan, specially given the holes in our squad.

As it stands now, we need a starting LW and backups at LW and RW. But imo, we have gaping holes at BOTH wings and seconda punta. If your thinking is that Quags will be fully recovered next season, then this is where we differ. I really want to believe it, but I don't think we'll see a good 2011/12 from Quags. Maybe in 2012/13, but not next season. Hope I'm wrong here.

This summer transfer market is a bit unique because we have four top-class seconda punta available: A world-class (Tevez), superstars-in-the-making (Aguero, Sanchez) and a very good one (Rossi). Of course we need to take care of the wings but you don't find four top class seconda punta available every year. I don't say it's easy, but it is easier to get very good wingers than SS.

It it were me, I'd take one of Tevez/Aguero/Sanchez and a starting LW now and add the backups in the next summer.",dwicarta ,"Jun 14, 2011 ", 2:50 PM,

Ok, no problem if you disagree, but at that level with that amount of time he should be recovered completely. Or I'm all for sacking the complete new medical staff…

Besides that I don't think we should let ourselves be guided by the availability of players more than looking at our own needs. We are Juventus after all and if we want to bring a world-class player, we should have no problems in doing so, as long as we're competitive and in the CL that is… If you're capable and willing to splash 25-35-45 mil you can always get players like respectively Rossi, Sanchez, Agüero. Especially with the FFP coming up, since everyone expects player values to drop quite significantly.

You won't hear me complaining if we can bring one of those guys home, especially Agüero if it were up to me, but I'd give Marotta a nice and warm foot massage if he could bring in for instance Nani and Bastos for about the same amount of money (30 + 15).",Robee ,"Jun 14, 2011 ", 3:10 PM,

Sergio Aguero is set to snub a move to Chelsea and Manchester City and finalise his transfer to Juventus.

Aguero, 23, was tipped to make a move into the Premier League after telling Atletico Madrid that he wants to leave the Spanish club.

Real Madrid were also strongly linked with the prolific forward, but they look set to switch their attentions to Brazilian hot-shot Neymar.

Reports in Italy suggest that Juventus have now won the race to sign Aguero and hope to announce his signing in the near future.

The Italian giants are believed to have met the £40m buy-out clause in his contract and are now looking to agree personal terms with the Argentine striker.

The news will come as a major blow to Chelsea and Manchester City who were hoping to land a big name forward during the summer and felt Aguero would be the ideal signing.

July 17, 2014 Corriere Della Sera

Barely three years after being appointed Chief Financial Officer of Exor, young businessman Jorid has been fired among shareholder upheaval. A complete unknown at the time of his hiring, little more is known of him now other than his seeming obsession with Juventus Football Club.

This obsession seems to be the source of the anger over his job performance, with unconfirmed reports suggesting he has completely ignored all aspects of Exor's finances in favor of providing Juventus with any funds it required or desired. One shareholder who requested anonymity due to death threats from Juventus ultras said, “It is mind boggling to me how someone could ignore the financial stability of a major multinational corporation in favor of something so trivial as football.”

Jorid is not universally reviled however; his contributions to Juventus' stunning return to glory have earned him the admiration and praise of almost all Juventus tifosi worldwide. His name is also occasionally heard in chants at the consistently sold out Juventus Stadium.

It was not clear whether Jorid would remain at his post or be forced out until late last month when a picture surfaced of Jorid celebrating with Pavel Nedved and Alessandro Del Piero, Juventus' new Champions League trophy in hand. The release of the picture was the last straw for shareholders, and it was only a matter of time until the announcement of his dismissal. It was originally hoped he would step down voluntarily, but it seems he was determined to keep Juventus' money line open as long as possible.

When contacted by email for a comment, Jorid cryptically responded only with a picture of David Trezeguet.",W ,"Jun 15, 2011 ", 6:30 AM,

1. Tevez-The most talented out of the bunch, would start for any national or club team without virtually any question, real question about him is his desire to play football any longer

2. Kun-Just beginning to hit his prime, would appreciate being a focal point of a long term project, would be a perfect player for us with regards to age, style, demeanor, etc. If signed, the team would be built around his talent. He is that special.

3. Sanchez-No doubt a superb talent and would fit in as a LW or SS which makes him probably the best fit positionally as he fits two. May have the most potential of the bunch, which if realized, could be one of the world's best. Added benefit of having him not be on Merda squad.

5. Higuain-Heard plenty about him at the beginning of the mercato but those murmurs have seemed to fade. Young and would thrive at a team that would actually play him. May be too much of a snob to leave Real despite no room for him (especially if Neymar is brought in)

5. Rossi-I wish nothing but the best for this guy. Has the benefit of having the ability to play dual roles (ala Sanchez). Would be nice to sign a young and prolific Italian but his style of play seems perfectly suited for Barca.

6. Neymar-I just don't see anyone with his arrogance willing to join, or being a meaningful leader of, an unsuccessful team devoid of true leadership. Real Madrid is just the right place for his brand of selfishness and immaturity.

7. Vucinic-I really don't see why we would want him. 7th place teams who strive for 3rd place or better should not take the 6th place team's refuse. He's not super young, he's got skill but nothing that would make your jaw drop, only redeeming quality is his considerably lower price tag when compared to the others
…
out of the remaining players that can potenitally start for us in a forward capacity….

10234. Iaquinta

15340. Amauri

b/c of the coach a team that collectively underperformed/ played w/o grinta often
no real left winger,

The FIGC decided to ignore/refute all the evidence uncovered in the Naples trial, which they can do if they please, as they are their own judge and jury. They had to ignore/refute that evidence because its existence and acceptance of its existence would make it impossible to ban Moggi, and also, they would likely have to ban many others, who are proven, by the naples trial evidence, to have been far far more sinister in their involvements with the refs and referee designators.

This decision is no surprise to anyone following the story at all closely.

The trouble the FIGC have is that Moggi, if he stays alive, WILL take this matter further. Even at this stage he could go to the EU high court AND to FIFA, and cause the FIGC allsorts of trouble. Which I assume he will do, after the Naples trial has concluded…although if the prosecution gets its way; there will be a mistrial called. Forget about their demands for 5 year prison sentences for moggi, thats simply fearmongering, trying to assert their confidence of his guilt, protecting themselves. Moggi isn't, however, made of paper…but a substance for more steely.

So…no need to take great shock at this latest Moggi ban. Its hardly a major development.

Glad I did and I want to see the federation and all of Italian football burn down to the ground.

If Moggi's claims about the information he has yet to reveal are even 1/2 true and the outcome from the Naples trial is a positive one (Prioreschi's work has been excellent), things are going to get interesting.

Have to admit that I find the number of Italians themselves who feel the same way pleasantly surprising honestly.

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"Here follows, the first segment of my late, but still useful, review of Juventus 2010/11…

2010/11 Season Juventus reviewAfter returning to Serie A we did well. Very well. Mainly due to the determination of our retained champions, aligned with the desire of those lesser, aspiring champions to step up their game, we finished a very respectable 3rd. However, the next season proved less wholesome. Ranieri was sacked with a handful of games to spare, when I felt he should be sacked, as from a champions league qualifying position, we were tumbling, and whilst to this day I still do not know the reason for such a serious slump; it happened.

Ciro Ferrara was brought in for the final games. 2009/10 was Ferrrara. A player I adored through his playing career, but as manager? He seemed always awful. From rugged toiler to apparent scholar more suited to the library…under his tutelage we fucked up. Ending up with Ciro's dismissal, and the entrance of Zacheroni…which did little to redirect our downward trajectory. This was the season before last, and we finished a woeful 7th. Jean claude Blanc, who had presided mainly, perhaps exclusively, over our fiscal policies beforehand but then somehow made his way to president, was replaced last summer by Andrea Agnelli. Finally, many of us roared with approval, a man who has Juve in his blood, a man who has success in the family businesses which extends far further than Juve.

Clearing the decks, he brought in Beppe Marotta as Sporting Director, and Luigi DelNeri as Manager. Both fresh from a season in charge of Sampdoria, who played lovely football and qualified for the champions league…So what happened nextA huge upheaval took place. Some players were sold, some couldn't be sold due to their high wages and contractual obligation on our part as a club, so were sent elsewhere with an agreement that we would make up the deficit of wages proffered by the team taking our apparently unwanted player…that sentiment is aimed almost solely at Trezeguet.From what I have garnered, its impossible to say whether Trez was pushed, or pulled (mainly by his wife and her desire to be in a warmer climate, closer to her family). So…no more than speculation can be added to the departure of our top foreign goalscorer of all time.

As for Camoranesi…his last season with us was awful; brief shows of quality, marred by shocking fouls, constant indiscipline, and a very clear reduction of potency.09/10 was our worst season for 50 years or so. Surely things were going to improve? With an Agnelli once again occupying the presidency, and the two men responsible for thrusting a traditionally provincial club into the upper echelons of champions league qualification in charge of first team squad matters…

Nobody can truly judge Beppe Marrota's moves in the mercato without first accepting and understanding what he was brought in to do. Lower the wage bill, lower the average age of the squad, remove the dead wood. We are not talking about a season of under-achievement, we are talking about our worst season for fifty fucking years…Everyone hoped/expected the following season, this season just passed, to bear more bountiful fruit.As its absolutely impossible for ANYONE to suggest who had major control of transfers, i am going with Marotta. As the Man who decided such things.

Out went Cannavaro, Trezeguet, Tiago (loan), camoranesi, marchionni, giovinco…and IN came Martinez, Aquilani, Traore, Pepe, Krasic, Rinaudo, Quagiarella, Bonucci, Storari and Rinaudo. and IN came Krasic, Quagiarella, Aquilani, Pepe, Lanzafame, Rinaudo, Traore.And so to the ratings…

GK
Marco Storari-
Signed for 4m, after a brilliant season at Sampdoria, Storari proved a wonderful acquisition. Conducting the regularly changing defence as best he could, and as for goalkeeping; he was astounding. A worthy substitute for Santo Buffon. Did everything asked of him, and was dishonorably displaced, as soon as Buffon was fit enough to play at first team duties. Whilst Delneri spoke of meritocracy, as soon as Santo Buffon was fit enough to aim for the first team, he was back IN, as first choice between the sticks. And he fared far from perfectly. As you would expect of any keeper who had been out of competitive action for 6 months, who had zero connection with the defence, let alone the rest of the team other than what could be found through watching from the sidelines…I understand why Buffon was brought back so quickly. For we were in a period of worsening disappointment, game by game…so why not bring back one of, if not the, best keepers in the game, a true living legend…the error there was that between the sticks, we were solid. Storari was one of few players who showed decent Steel. when called upon, he was either ultra dependable or magnificent. I hope he stays, but understand fully if he leaves, because he is simply too good a keeper to be playing second fiddle to anyone but the world's best.

Prediction: Sold…or used in part exchange, NOT due to pressure from our end, but due to a likelihood that Buffon will be number one, and Marco Storari, or anyone else, will be second choice.
Played 23. 6 clean sheets. 71 saves.
Storari 9/10

Buffon
Sidelined from the start of the season until January, in need of surgery and a lengthy recovery period. Before he returned to the fold, Delneri was spouting nonsense of a meritocracy in the squad. Then his own actions suggested otherwise, for once fit, the impressively performing Storari was instantly, and in my view, wrongly displaced. With Buffon back between the sticks, many assumed he would regain his divine form of recent years straight away…but alas…this was not to be. Signaling a serious problem in terms of player power, Buffon was brought back in to the starting XI, and seemed nothing like the Buffon we all know and love. He singlehandedly lost us two games. Against Lecce with his needless red card, and worse, and whilst not totally down to his own efforts, or lack of, after the loss to one of our few prime enemies, he was seen laughing and joking with gattusso. Which to me, was and remains, absolutely disgraceful. Don't get me wrong, for I love and revere Santo Buffon, but his form, upon his return to the first eleven, was far removed from both the standard set by Storari, and also the standards of the past set by Buffon himself.

That is not at all to suggest that Buffon has lost something, moreover, its an appreciation and acceptance, that like other players, after a long period in the medical room, he needs time to regain match sharpness. And the time he was thrust back into the squad, was a period when we were so awfully and obviously, on the way DOWN. Awful stewardship of the squad by delneri…I have no desire to suggest that he has lost anything, for I truly believe, that with a solid pre season, no more injuries, he can regain his spot, as one of the best goalkeepers alive and still playing at the top level.Played 16. 4 clean sheets. 40 saves.Buffon 6/10.

Michele Pazienza is a Juventus Player
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v…

The midfielder underwent a medical today and has signed a three-year contract to keep him at the club until 30th June 2014.

A midfield destroyer, but not just one who ‘breaks up play’. Michele Pazienza matches quality with quantity. His game couples endless running and teamwork, with well-timed bursts into the box and crucial assists.

Born on 5th August 1982, in San Severo (Foggia), he began his football education with ‘Gruppo Sportivo Apocalisse’ and joined Foggia at 17 years old, ready for the step up to professional football. He spent four seasons in Puglia, making a decisive contribution to the side’s promotion to C1 in his last campaign. The midfielder then moved to Udinese in Summer 2003, enjoying two years as a key component of the side before switching to Fiorentina. He was also a first team mainstay for two seasons in Firenze.

During the mid-season transfer market, he elected to go south and join Napoli, becoming a vital cog in the team’s system. Pazienza scored his first Serie A goal on 13th December 2008 in the victory over Lecce. Three more strikes were to follow as he cemented his role in the side that has recently qualified for the 2011 Champions League.

And really, what's with the shirt?

I may have come across as being too dismissive of him in my first comment, but if you read closely I do make the point of saying he is a good signing and rather this move happened than not. Of course, I welcome him with open arms and think he has quality.

That's where my agreement with you ends, however.

My point was that he's another CM to be added to a surplus already.

I said he is not an improvement on any of our starting CM's i.e. Melo, Aquilani, Marchisio.

1)If you think he is better than Marchisio and Aquilani you should petition Prandelli to slot him in on the national team which he has never been within sniffing distance of. You know, the same team which recently and continually starts both our Italian CMs.
2)If you meant he's better than Melo, I assure you, you are the only one who does.

The logic of “His team finished higher in the table, therefore he is better than our CM's” is flawed on so many levels I don't know where to start. I mean what? I guess this obviously erroneous statement sums up your reasoning:

“Ziegler's team got relegated so, yes, I think our fullbacks are better than him!!!!”

I just wanted to say that he isn't useless(not saying you said that) And that Marotta did good deal by replacing Sissoko with the same or(for me) better player and still paying him much less and by selling Sissoko we could get 8mil at least I hope…

But the real trick is that he came as a substitute, but not as a substitute for Aqua or Melo, cause they wont be with us next year, or even Marchisio who will be sub aswell if we dont play 4-3-3, which according to CONTE we won't.

He came as a sub for a new destructor that is coming(Inler,Diarra,Fernando) and I think its great that we didnt have to pay for a sub cause if you want a decent sub(which Pazi is) you must pay 5-10mil… But now we get him for free and I think its a good deal…

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"Udinese HAS to be the smartest football club in Italy.

At the end of the 2009-10 season, Granada CF and Barcelona B finished first and second in the third tier of Spanish football, both gaining promotion to Liga Adelante. This past season, Barcelona B finished 3rd and Granada finished 5th.
Promotion into La Liga is almost identical to promotion into the Premier League. That is, the best two sides in the league go directly into La Liga while the next four battle it out in promotion playoffs. However, there’s one caveat. Barcelona B could not compete for promotion into La Liga because it is part of FC Barcelona and two sides from the same club cannot play in the same league. Instead, 7th place Real Valladolid was able to take on 4th place Elche CF in the playoff semifinals. Elche progressed into the promotion final in dramatic fashion, as did Granada. One Spanish club from Andalusia and one from the province of Alicante, it all seemed so straightforward.
However, when Granada faced Celta Vigo this past Saturday in the playoff semifinal, 6 out of the 11 starters were Udinese-owned. In fact, 11 players on the Granada roster are ""on loan"" from the Italian club, including starlets such as Dani Benitez (pictured above) and internationals such as Ghana’s Jonathan Mensah. Simply, the majority of Granada’s squad is an Udinese B filled with Spanish flair. Where the rules stopped this year’s Barça B squad from progressing, Udinese used a different country to push forward. And now, after the two matches in the playoff final on Wednesday and Saturday, Udine could essentially have a team in both Serie A and La Liga. An Italian job indeed.
The transformation was a novel one, but by no means are Granada’s fans upset by the Italian presence; they are absolutely loving their rapid resurgence in Spanish football. El Graná are back and the seats in Los Cármenes are filled once again. So how did this happen exactly? Well, let’s start with Udinese owner Gino Pozzo.
In 2009, Granada CF was a club in crisis, both competitively and financially. The club was on the brink of disappearing, despite a rich 80 year history. Gino Pozzo saw a money-making opportunity that would double as a way to develop Udinese talent, and in July 2009, the two clubs signed a partnership agreement so the majority of Granada’s squad would become Udinese-owned, while the Italian club could also send over its reserves and youngsters.
So what are the benefits for Gino Pozzo and Udinese Calcio? Well, the strategy is to use the exposure Granada gets in the Spanish league to showcase Udinese-owned talent that will, in turn, gain value in the transfer market. With Pozzo’s commitment to investing, Granada only seems likely to improve in the future. And Pozzo’s ""buy cheap, gain exposure, sell high"" philosophy is already working. Just imagine the possibilities for profit if Granada gets into the top flight in Spain.
Will Granada’s success be sustainable? Yes, and legally so. Though Pozzo said, ""we put ourselves in Granada because it is a city with a great football potential,"" there is also a legal framework that ensures that Udinese’s partnership with Granada is a permanent one. But amongst this clever system, one thing remains clear: if Granada are promoted the boys by the alhambra will not be the only one reaping the rewards.
But is this the start of a larger trend? Udinese’s plan is profitable and it has revived Granada. As a result, both parties are happy. Real Madrid have a notable connection with Getafe, but it’s not quite as imposing as this. Should Barcelona abandon Barça B, take over local side Catalan side Girona FC and make a run for La Liga? Should Arsenal impose its eye for talented youth by rebuilding Nantes in Ligue 2? Is this the future of relationships between the ‘haves and have-nots’ of football?",Somnath_Sengupta ,"Jun 17, 2011 ", 4:21 AM,

I can tell you what I know from the experience of this years that I am a Fan of football and of course a Juventus tifoso.

In order to get a very big name or maybe two there is a need to have a lot of patience… and now I mean to us the Fans because we because of the last 2 years we are so impatient to see at Juventus new players that really can give us quality… we are tired about the quantity..

And now comes the moment that we have to understand..we have to rational …

You can take a look on the last years on the Summer Tranfer market and the exact days that the “BIG” names have actually moved from one team to another…. doing so you will learn that a large majority of BIG names transfers are done in the last 2 weeks maybe in last day of the Transfer Market…

So my advice is this: let's try to be patient… it's hard I know… we don't have games to watch nothing else to talk about…read about… BUT let's have a little patience… on 1st of September I will be the first to analyze the list of players IN and OUT from Juventus…

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"I few years ago, I built a couple of files, tracking the progress of Juve youth players – in the Primavera, and spread across Italy and Europe. Juve had so many youngsters on their books, with names being hailed and touted as the next big thing. Occasionally young players from abroad would be snapped up and added to the ranks, but then farmed out and forgotten.
Many of these players have resurfaced in Serie A and ply their trade at less fashionable teams.
Marco Rigoni, for example, now 31 and recently promoted to Novara, looks set to play his first Serie A match since Jan 1999, when he made his first and only appearance in black & white, after being touted as the next Del Piero.
That same year, there was uproar from some English team (I forget who now), when we snapped up Irish youngster Ronnie O'Brien. Who promptly sank without a trace.
Whilst I totally agree with sections of the article above, and at times Juve's policy concerning youngsters has STUNK, I also think that more often than not, certain players just aren't going to make it to the top, no matter what.
The list of Juve youngsters who never made the top is endless… Whilst a few had little glimpses of fame and fortune, it was only 15 minutes, and then they were pushed on to smaller teams and still failed to live up to early hype…
Rapphaele Ametrano?
Nicola Cingolani?
Salvatore Aronica?
Marco Zamboni?
Jonathan Bachini?
I could carry on for hours….

On a different point, is anyone else glancing over at events at Inter and grinning broadly at the total pandemonium surrounding their pre-season? Chaos at management level, and uncertain transfer policies? It looks like a return to usual! The only way Moratti's men could win Serie A was to f*ck the league with Calciopoli and wipe out the opposition. But it looks like enough teams have recovered, and Inter are back to their old ways again (I hope).
I also hope more than that, that Conte back at Juve will mean a return to our old winning ways too. Only time will tell, and I hope I'm smiling even more by June next year.
(If it's not too much to ask, a Scudetto/Coppa Italia double? And Inter missing out on the Champion's League?)…

————————
On a different point – Juve wear our two stars with pride, commemorating 10 scudetti each. Prior to calciopoli we were up to 29 scudetti, but the record books now read 27. So, minimum 3 years before we see 3 stars. When, inevitably, Juve win their 10th Coppa Italia, how will that be celebrated, if at all?
I'm an illustrator, and a dreamer. I hope we save up our 10th Coppa win to coincide with our 30th Scudetto. Instead of two stars side by side, we'd wear a pyramid of three stars, the top one encircled with a laurel wreath for our 10th Coppa….

Regarding our scudetti, everyone at Juve still considers the team to have 29 scudetti. They've said the next scudetto the team earn will be celebrated with a 3rd gold star. So definitely not a minimum of 3 years. As for the Coppa, I believe 10 Coppa Italia's are celebrated with a silver star. So theoretically, if Juve win the double, they would get both a gold and silver star for their jerseys the following year. Not sure how all the stars would be placed, but those are the kinds of problems I can live with ;)",Anthony ,"Jun 17, 2011 ", 4:47 PM,

It's amazing all those teams got away with a slap on the wrist when they did far worse than anything Moggi did. But they twisted Moggi's words to make him look like the ringleader. Moggi deserves to have his name cleared. I don't think Adam would post that comment since I think he knows a lot about calciopoli.

It's interesting to see people going ga ga over a guy who has played 3 Serie A games and while defending Marotta for letting go a talented youngster.

Piazon not getting playing time at Chelsea has absolutely nothing to do with the deal with Juve. I don't even understand why that is relevant. I also don't know how you figured out that Marotta decided that Piazon wasn't worth double the salary that Del Piero makes. ADP went from 4m to 1m this season. Piazon (or his agent) was asking for 1m.

We would have gotten him if he had agreed on 0.5m Euros. Then, would you have said “let's wait until he actually scores a goal or gets an assist or even plays a minute of football in Europe”?. The last is actually redundant since we are not even in Europe.

So, for 0.5m he is a stud in the making, but for 1m you are eager to see him fail?

I was told by my source a month ago that LICHT and INLER are JUVE players, no matter what is written in the media…

I still bealieve my source and I think INLER is a JUVE player!! If he would choose Napoli he would already be there cause Udinese & Napoli have an agreement over INLER for 6 months now…

But when INLER said that JUVE wants him he made up his mind and is coming to Torino!!

Napoli have turned their attention to Dzemaili(Parma) according to TuttoJuve…

Inler would be a great addition and form the exact partnership that Conte wants together with Marchisio. Very dynamic, tactically strong, hard working players that know how to keep possession, push forward and here and there score a few goals.

Inler, Marchisio with Pazienza and possibly Melo or Sissoko as a back-up and Pirlo as joker, looking fantastic. Diarra is nothing but a bas smoke screen if you ask me.",Robee ,"Jun 18, 2011 ", 10:21 AM,

Iago Falqué: A Case Study of Serie A's Failure with Youth,The Offside Juventus,"Jun 11, 2011, 6:51pm PDT",,"im curious on people's views on the signing of pazienza – How do people feel about what his role will be here and ultimately, how much of an impact will he have… What sort of signal does this send to the rest of the current midfield personnel? who's in and who's definitely out.. interesting. this team is starting to take on a new identity with even these 3 recent free transfers.. Maybe with the signing of Lichstenier, and then hopefully a major signing i.e. Aguerro or Rossi, Inler etc.. (Sanchez isnt coming here, why would he leave a CL team to go to a team thats not in Europe?).. If Buffon gets his act together and Quags and Matri are solid again, we might have a chance as I do think Inter is on the downward spiral big time.

Regarding Bonucci and Sorensen, it seems people think its a bit of a conundrum on what to do with Sorenson.. I say put him in his rightful CB position and make Bonucci work his ass to get it back.. I know Sorenson is young, but we as fans are always lamaneting how we always have this youth but seem to fuck it up in some way shape or form… or developiong their talent and sending them on loan somewhere else, I say fuck that. We always send our good young players out on loan and for what? for them to score a brace everytime they play us? Keep him here and let him learn and let him play alot..I 'll bet Conte will do wonders with this kid and will instill the qualities needed to be successful.. Yes Sorenson is young and everyone will call me crazy for taking this angle.. Sorenson made mistakes last year because of his age and inexperience while Bonucci was making mistakes because he was careless and erratic, and who the hell knew where his head was at on so many blunders.. Sorenson is the better player, period.. I think at this point, Sorenson is the better prospect, so we really should give him a fair shot… Many of the big clubs around the world have very young phenoms at certain positions, granted they are certainly good enough to be playing.. This is Juve's chance to start showing the faith in their youth and doing things a little differently than they have the last bunch of years..

I didn't post it to make a joke out of Bove's passing. It's a provocation towards 'dunce and duncer', I'm willing to bet money that neither of them have ever read or heard his name, let alone know what is believed to have been his cause of death.

For me the Summer Mercato of Juventus is until now very good.

The idea of paying 40-50 Millions on a player is not in Juventus nature….there was only one Summer that was not like any other summers …there was the summer of 2001 when Zidane left to Real and so Juventus bought Gianluigi Buffon, Lilian Thuram and Pavel Nedvěd ..but this is the exception ….

Are we in the same situation like 10 years ago? or are we in the same situation like 20 years ago when Antonio Conte, Kohler and Peruzzi and of course Giuseppe Trapattoni arrived?

My idea of football is one that doesn't involve Circus (see chelsea, real, city…) and Juventus most of the times with some exceptions is a Club that hasn't anything to do with Circus….

I think that all this Players that are 40-50-60 millions worth there are not in our DNA and I give you a small quote from the same guy that now is on our Bench:
“The love (from supporters) must be earned with the attachment to the Colors. Don’t let you be bought by some excellent technical play. ..”

Then very few clubs could afford top class players and the competition to sign these players was comparetively less. These days with the flurry of foreign ownership a lot of clubs can afford to spend on players which makes competition more and therefore the highest bidder gets best players. It is easy to dismiss Chelsea for their spending but their success rate since they started spending cannot be dismissed. 3 EPL titles, two FA Cups and being one of the most consistent teams in EPL – not too shabby for a club which won nothing for 50 years, eh ? Juventus rarely spent like crazy but Baggio, Vialli or Anastasi were signed at then world record transfer fees. If you think that player is worth the money, you spend. Otherwise we end up with only Pepes and Martinezs and no top class players.

I just went through the transfer record stats and guess what Juventus broke the record 4 times (Sivori, Baggio, Vialli, Anastasi) – same as Real Madrid :)",Somnath_Sengupta ,"Jun 3, 2011 ", 7:46 AM,

Not a whole lot. He's never come out and been too explicit about the issue in one way or another, always relatively reserved and tactful. When he was called in to testimony a few months ago he gave his piece of mind and did well. Which is what irks me most about Giorgio's words. If you have ambitions of becoming Juve's captain one day and lead, you need to show more tact. There's 14+ million fans in Italy alone, the trial is still going on and even if your statement might have not meant any harm and you think Calciopoli was bullshit, there's bound to be a lot of grumpy fans after they read it (which there was). As an article about his statement said: “Chiellini si e sbilanciato”, that's a no-no.

No disagreements here. He's the one from Juventus who can do the most about the issue at the moment.

“it shouldn't be in the mind of any of the players”

A lot of the players just need to be more reserved/careful with what they state publicly. Worry about playing for 90 minutes, try to win and go home. Chiellini with his “Vincete voi” to Allegri or whoever it was before the Milan home game, Marchisio with his “I thank Calciopoli for giving me the chance to become a Juve player”, what Legro used to say about Calciopoli, Giorgio's latest statement about Calciopoli being over and done with etc were all very tactless and naive. Same with Claudio bitching about his contractual situation on Facebook a while back.

I'm 99.99% sure no real harm was meant with any of those statements but I'm 100% sure they were all perceived as inopportune and unnecessary by most fans. Just look at the reactions.

Also, Conte needs to tell the players to quit the incessant “we are going to put our heads down and try to make it up to the fans”, “we are the only ones to blame for this situation”, “we are not giving up” claims we have seen so much of the last two seasons as soon as things start going sour.

I used to care a few years ago, but it was too stressful and most of the time not worthwhile. Now I only pay attention when I've seen these rumors repeatedly over different sites and over a consistent period of time (and obviously if they make sense in the first place). After a while one kinda develops a sixth sense about all of this transfer rumor, and you can realize since the beginning which ones are pure and plain BS, and which ones are worth following.

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"With the league and all competitive action now well and truly finished, its time to turn our heads and hearts towards the mercato. After the second consecutive season of abject failure, it makes sense for me to assume that many of you share my desire to see the squad changed. Perhaps not fundamentally, but certainly there are players who have proven beyond all doubt that they are not fit to wear our jersey. Marotta has his own agenda, which is hopefully, in the least, headed towards a shared aim of Success and Improvement. The manner in which Conte and Marrotta spoke of the mercato in the official unveiling presentation gave me reason to feel positive. For it appears that Conte WILL have, (as will Paratici), a serious say in who leaves and who arrives. As for my own views on the players we need to send packing…
Without any doubt whatsoever:
Motta
Iaquinta
Amauri
Grosso
Rinaudo
Traore

Players I feel have some value, but still, their time at Juve is DONE:
Salihamidžić
Manninger
Momo Sissoko
Luca Toni

Players who I wouldn't mind leaving the ranks, but neither would I mind them remaining:
Pepe
Martinez
De Ceglie

The only name above which causes me hesitation is that of Martinez. For I am unsure what to think of him. We spent rather highly, perhaps too much, on a player who looked often very useful in Sicily, but who for us, has proven so far, nothing more than a total waste of $$$$$$. His purchase was strange in itself, given his best form prior to his transfer to Vinovo, was as an always advanced, left wing forward, deployed to cut into the box, with pace and flair, and aim for goal. However, the position he was asked to play for us was that of a traditional touchline hugging left winger, able to defend as well as flood forward, with his main objective in the final third delivering crosses into the box for others to pounce upon. The reason for his signing is a separate issue entirely. What I am interested in now, is whether Conte can play him to his own natural strengths. If the many reports of Conte's tendency towards wide attackers in a 4-2-4 are to be believed, then clearly, Martinez would be suitable. The main problem with selling him now, is that after such a poor season, played out of position, suffering consistently from niggling injuries, his value has surely plummeted. Do we cut our losses? or give him a chance pre-seaon to impress in a more natural role?

Some may be surprised to read of De Ceglie included in my FOR FUCKS SAKE JUST LEAVE list…but…I hasten to ask those who show surprise…other than 2 months in which he looked competent, not brilliant, just competent, what else has he proven? He has a sturdy engine, likes to get involved physically, wicked pace, and is capable of crossing intelligently and consistently. But defensively??? I would be happy for him to stay, play the understudy to Ziegle, who whilst hardly world class, has shown reliability in his position, is well traveled through various leagues, and still young. Compared to De Ceglie, Ziegle is the more developed, the more assured, the more reliable.

Amauri may well have shown usefulness at Parma, with zero pressure, and the whole offence geared towards putting the ball on his head or feet. Well done, Amauri…I wish you well. ELSEWHERE.

Which leaves…Giovinco. la formica atomica. A player much maligned by juventini, mainly for his alleged bitterness at the lack of opportunites given to him at Juventus. Surely there is nobody who can seriously suggest that he hasn't excelled once given regular playing time at Parma? He has broken into the nazionale…He has pace, invention, sometimes, even often, mesmerizing ability on the ball. And yet he seems set to stay with Parma…or at least 99.999999% sure to stay there. I would like him to come home, and cannot imagine that if Conte called him, told him he needed him, that Giovinco would choose Parma over us.

Lichtsteiner is coming in for 8mil+Storari. When he heard Juve wants him he decided on his future(MCity also wanted him). As a backup RB it will probably be Masiello. Beck is also possible but not very liked by Conte.
Inler is already a Juve player but this might be delayed because of a combined offer for Inler+Sanchez=30mil + half of Ekdal + half Giovinco (Pozzo didn't say no but will probably come back with a modified offer)
The deal for Aquilani is made. Price is 10mil but it's up to Conte if he wants him. He'd rather have Montolivo(who could come cheap because he wants out of Fiora; contract end 2012) so it's either Aquilani or Monotlivo.
Pazienza as a sub confirmed.
Sissoko wants out and Juve is letting him go, it looks like he's going to Marseille.
Juve want Melo out(arguments with the managment and the players) the problem is no one wants him(yet).

My point of posting the Martinez pic was that the “Marotta haters” as N.G. said were simply criticizing him for his mistakes, and that is all. This was also the result of frustrating campaign. If we had indeed qualifying for Champions League, no one would have talked about Martinez.

If he does a good job, he will get a deserved praise. Like hate for Melo 1.0 and love for Melo 2.0.

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"You can't go by just one game though. If we looked at any of Melo's games last year we'd say he's shit. Inler had a very good season with Udinese. I'd be more inclined to judge him by that than one game with his national team. It could also mean he has a transfer on his mind. Cassani played crap in the Coppa Italia final against Inter. Doesn't make him a crappy player. He too probably had a transfer on his mind.

The way I see it is that Inler suits Conte's tactics. He suits them far better than Aquilani. And while I like Aquilani, I can see Conte saying that he's not ideal for his tactics. His willing to adapt his formation to suit Pirlo because Pirlo is a champion and was a free transfer. But I don't think he's willing to adapt for Aquilani who'd cost 16 million. I can see him saying to use that money to sign Inler who suits his tactics perfectly.

If we play a 4-3-3 next year and had Aquilani instead of Inler, then Melo, Pirlo and Marchisio would start. Or maybe Aquilani would start ahead of Marchisio. He wouldn't be a sub for Pirlo though. If Pirlo comes off, Conte is going to switch to his preferred 4-2-4. Aquilani doesn't fit in that formation for Conte. Aquilani can only be accommodated in his 4-3-3, and I don't think he's considered a starter in that formation either because he'd want more physical players alongside Pirlo. And in the 4-2-4, Conte wants more physical players like Melo, Marchisio, Inler or Pazienza.

Basically what it comes down to is Inler fits the coaches tactics better than Aquilani. Conte probably said if you can get Aquilani for cheap then cool, but otherwise get me someone I can use. I'm not saying Aquilani is a bad player. I like him a lot. But why would Juve spend 16 million on a player that doesn't suit the coaches tactics. Pirlo was free and is a champion player despite being past his best. Conte will adapt for him, but said even he will have to fight for his spot.",Anthony ,"Jun 5, 2011 ", 1:08 AM,

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"Moggi is exaggerating greatly by saying he wouldn't have Ziegler or Pazienza even on the bench. We've had worse players on our bench under Moggi. And we have worse ones on our bench now too. Replacing Grosso with Ziegler and Sissoko with Pazienza for free is very good. We offload players and replace them with better ones at no cost to us. In fact, I'm sure we'll get some money for Sissoko. So if we replace Sissoko with Pazienza, we'll be replacing him with someone better and be making a profit. Seems like good business to me.

Moggi doesn't actually think we're going to sign world class backups this summer as well. That's not possible. If we can increase the quality depth on the team with free transfers, then of course we should. Moggi is just trying to make a point in saying that this team isn't at the level of the old Juve yet. Everyone knows it, but he gets paid to give his opinion so he gives it. Would he rather Juve keep Grosso and Sissoko for depth? No, of course not. Ideally Juve would bring in world class players in every position, but it's not possible. Moggi knows this.

He gets paid for giving his opinion, and he gets the attention when his statements are provocative and exaggerated. Trust me, Moggi knows that we have a budget and are using the budget for only 2 maybe 3 champions. If we wish to strengthen any other position, it needs to be for free. But if Moggi comes out and says that, who's gonna listen. It doesn't grab your attention lol.",Anthony ,"Jun 5, 2011 ", 1:28 AM,

We have Quagliarella and Del Piero for seconda punta. When we're playing the 4-3-3, as I'm sure we'll see it whenever Pirlo is playing, then Sanchez will be used as LW and Krasic as RW flanking a prima punta rather than playing a seconda punta.

I think Sanchez is probably better when played as a seconda punta or even trequartista rather than as a winger, but Conte likes wingers who can take on players one-on-one. Sanchez fits that description.",Anthony ,"Jun 5, 2011 ", 1:41 AM,

-Bucaro is not the best manager the Primavera has ever had. He's GDN level: not terrible but his substitutions, fixations on playing some players/not playing some others as much and general work has been mediocre to decent at best. For example, most people will agree that Carlos Garcia is a pretty decent CB prospect, arguably more promising than Esposito and Rubin and he did fairly well when he had to defend against ADP last summer in a friendly. Garcia has seen the pitch sporadically this season, that's about it. He is one of the younger players on the squad but still, Bucaro didn't seem to care too much for him. People are saying that Bucaro doesn't even compare to a guy like say, Chiarenza.

-The players aren't that good. Probably the most important issue. There's only a couple of players who can be seen deserving of the first team(not start, just be part of the roster). Sorensen, Giandonato, Giannetti, that's about it. If you really want to stretch things, Boniperti and Buchel too, I guess. For example, for a guy who was poached by Chelski with a fucking helicopter, who made his debut as a pro at a ridiculously young age and as someone who's pretty gifted physically, Camilleri's season was meh.

-A decent amount of injuries. Camilleri's season wasn't terribly impressive but he also was troubled by injuries like a few other players as well.

TL;DR: Players are meh, manager is meh.

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"Whatever our Conte formation, our left side remains presently…absolutely awful in the offensive third, and at best, in the defensive area; solid. I am far from amazed by the Ziegler move, but he is often very solid, can pass, can cover, can take corners, can cross…which is more than we have had for so fucking long, that it makes him seem like a godsend (especially for free and on a low wage). I will be content to have Ziegler as the starter and de ceglie challenging ( who has proven NOTHING…other than a month or two of competency).

As for the offensive left flank? We have been so poor in that area that delneri tried to convert a central midfielder into a mezz'ala. that says it all really…so, the idea of adding bastos or perotti, is welcome. as either would hugely improve our offensive left flank options.I wont pretend, like many on these virtual juve fansites, to have valuable knowledge of every single league, of every single player, those people are idiots…when i see a poster talking with confidence about a player in the dutch league, then the english league, then the french league, then the spanish league, then the italian league, then the german league…i immediately conclude : 'they are speaking shit'. for NOBODY has enough time to study all of those leagues, all of those players, and still sleep, shit, fuck or chase women, work/study…that stance is the stance of idiots who need so much to be respected for their 'knowledge', for their dedication, for their all knowing passion for football. Nobody I know face to face, who I consider a passionate football supporter, and also tactically aware, asserts intimate knowledge of more than one league. Sometimes some awareness of more than one, but never molre than happily confident of knowing ONE LEAGUE…

As for my own areas of what I would call adequately solid awareness of a league for the last 15 years or so; I know the english Premiership, likely more intimately than I know Serie A…I mean, that I could much more easily talk about ANY team in the premiership, than ANY team in Serie A, knowing at least their style, their manager, their main decent players, and will have seen them play often over the last decade or so…I am much better acquainted with blackpool, and charlie adam, and holloway, than i am with brescia, or Bari. In the 90s, it was the other way around, but since around 2005/6, massively due to my movements out of england; my need for football news, games, tournaments, has been focused firstly on the premiership, juventus and whoever they play against, then secondly on Gillingham, and whoever they play against.Most of my time in the homeland, has been spent around men who follow english football first and foremost, so its no surprise, that despite the unchallengeable love for Juve I have held close to me for 18 years now, my greatest exposure to football, is very English. So…I have seen some of Bastos, both for brazil and for Lyon. he has always looked hugely more valuable than both Pepe, and Marchiso as a mezz'ala.

As for perotti…i knew not even of his name until yesterday. And from what I have seen, of many youtube clips, he seems capable with both feet, far from lacking confidence to beat players, very, very quick on the ball, with a high quality array of passing…but that is based on around…5/6 youtube clips showcasing his apparent talents.

Presently in our squad we have…very solid chiellini, perhaps world class, at times…potentially very solid bonucci…world class buffon…likely safe and secure ziegler…no right back…melo and pirlo as a potentially brilliant central pairing…krasic as a lightning fast, able to improve further still, right winger/wing forward…a half dead DP, a recovering Quag, a vibrant centre forward in Matri…The most glaring omissions from that team are: a seriously potent seconda punta, a high quality left winger, and a solid right back. that really isn't hard to fathom. if perotti can be that left winger, we only need two more first XI purchases and we will be in a position to challenge for 2nd/3rd. Inter, i hope will keep leonardo, for he is not a great manager, and will keep them within our sights. Milan? at least for a year or two, success will breed success…we need to accept this. make a team that can knit together and fight for 2nd and 3rd. Roma seem at best, disjointed for the near future. Napoli have a great team spirit, but less quality overall than what we could and should possess. Lazio? have made good use of our failings and Roma's failings and Inter's shocking, but useful for others, managerial appointments. Udinese will lose Inler and Sanchez. Two of the their three major reasons for such a fine season. Replacing those two will be extremely hard.

I would be very much appreciative to learn of the view of anyone who truly follows la liga, and has seen Perotti often over the last two years…Personally, I like argies…probably because half my blood is sicilian, and 2/3rds of the argies are of italian origin, especially of southern italian origin..so they have, by a majority, some of the traits, of italians, that I have, partially but well expressed within my crimson rivers, and also, which i like in footballers. Whilst my english half always found joy with the savagery of vinny jones at wimbledon, the constant brutality of julian dicks, my italian half found joy with the brutality of montero, the cunning thuggery of cannavaro, the fascist arrogance of moller, the brute force of righteousness of thuram in full flight…the argies are rarely lacking a very latin kind of ruggedness and cunning…other than the spaniards and portuguese, who are a very different kinda latin blood to the italians, south and central americans. The flair is common, but the extreme lack of manliness, of the spanish and portuguese, is not common.

If we don't buy Inler but get a good discount on Aquilani then we may be able to afford a seconda punta for 30m, not that we need it. I rather get Inler and a good RB, if we can throw 15-20m at LW and call it a day I would be satisfied.

When he was here his first year he would have been competing with Nedved and ADP, and I for one think Ranieri made the right choice keeping Giovinco on the bench. The second year he was playing against ADP for a starting role in a 4-3-1-2 and when I saw him play as a trequartista he was mostly a flop, and as a seconda punta he was too light. The fact that the team was so poorly assembled is not his fault and it didn't help him but the fact remains that he wasn't the best at the position he was playing at.

The only times he played well was against Samp and Napoli in a 4-2-3-1, but then Camo got injured, ADP came back and we had to revert to the narrower 4-3-1-2 where he couldn't perform.

Giovinco needs a team built around him, and if he was Messi then Juve may have to have a whole transfer strategy based on him. However, he is no Messi and only a team of the quality of Parma can afford to build around a player of Giovinco's quality. I rather keep him at Parma, see his value go up (he will thrive in a team built entirely for him) and sell him at a hefty profit in 2 years time.

- Juve needs to buy champions to go back to where Juve belongs (really, genius)
- Two or three players have been criticized because they do not fulfill the expectations of the fans. Some are not Juve quality and can't fight for the scudetto.
- I was also criticized during my first season but I am glad I found myself, know I need to win tittles with this squad.

The first point is getting so old it just makes me sick. Of course, let's bring in Messi, Xavi, Vidic, Pique, D. Evra, etc. really?. This comments do nothing but trivialize the job of Marotta and the management, does anyone really think that Marotta doesn't know that four stellar players can do wonders for Juve?. Marotta can talk about champions, Conte can, Paratici can, and Agnelli can, everyone else doesn't know the budget and the plan so they should shut up and work hard. These comments are like Marotta coming out and saying if Motta would play like Cassani this squad would be better, we need Pepe to cross like Bale. These statements help no one.

The two or three players he is talking about are probably Motta and Martinez, maybe Grosso. Clearly they are not Juve quality but again, to take a hit on your teammates like that?, he could have just requested a transfer and saved us the problems.

I am glad F. Melo did great last year and if Juve don't have an offer for more than 15m then he should stay but this guy is trouble.

But lack of patience, lack of foresight, lack of nerves, lack of imagination has grounded this project before it began.
It is completely fair for a player, esp. someone with gio's talent, to want to play rather than sit on the bench. He's not demanding huge salaries, he wants a stable environment to develop. It's also perfectly fair for Juve to say no. It's a negotiation in which both sides have needs. They can agree to disagree.

The 'tiranti' are the cords that were included in the design that are generating a lot of controversy. Giraudo claims that his original stadium project didn't include these cords which can hinder the view from that specific part of the stadium and pretty much blames Blanc+the new management for fucking things up with the new project they decided to go with.

The club announced in an official statement that:

-these cords were part of the original project which took shape in 2008,
-all the project architects that they have consulted have assured them of the low impact the cords will have on the visibility,
-these sections will probably not be available for purchase for season ticket packs and they are considering the possibility of offering them for reduced prices,
-so far there is no possibility for these cords to be removed in the future once the stadium usage gets underway,
-'due to space conflicts with the other parts of the stadium complex (shopping center, restaurants etc)', the stadium maximum capacity was projected to only be ~41000, thus making the stadium ineligible for consideration for a C.L or E.L final due to Uefa's minimum venue requirements of 50000 seats,

Even if we can afford to splash 30 million on a winger, how many of those wingers will want to join Juve without European soccer? I trust that Agnelli, Marotta, Paratici, Nedved and Conte will know how to make the best out of the situation and get the best players they can.

Look at Melo under Ferrara/Zac and then w Del Neri. On the one hand, he looked like an uncontrollable and undisciplined dickhead; on the other, he was (for the most part, Parma aside) reserved and a mature player with patience.

I really like Vucinic, love Balkan players, and hate Roma. If we are able to capture Vucinic (who aside from all this would be a MUCH cheaper option to some of the other people we have been discussing), I would fully support the decision.

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"Some thought by me on Pepe and Iaquinta.

First Iaquinta, this is a very strange guy. He is good with no doubt at all. He did perform well these season no doubt about it. But he is getting too injury prone.. I mean I like him, but any reason why is going thru? Is it cause of age?

http://www.goal.com/en/news/10… (True or False)

But at the end of day, I want him to leave.

Second Pepe, Pepe pepe.. He is above average. Not Juve Material thats for sure. As much as he try with his 300% effort, we know he cant keep his composure at the final stretch. Yet he provides something quite important (i suppose), and that he is a team guy. He provides a very nice team feeling to it. He is likeable by teammates, and he treats them well. I think we should keep him mainly as a backup on either wings,fullbacks,or worse case scenario striker.

I dun noe why, but the following video i guess shows how much he teammates like him?

Melo will be sold and that is because the board(AGNELLI & NEDVED) wont tolerate this kind of behavior!!

He isnt to loved among the squad aswell, because of his childlish behaivor!!!

And don't forget what he did last year to his fans!!! CURVA will never forgive him!!

This is JUVENTUS and you need stile to play for JUVENTUS!!!

Melo is one of the best in his position when he is calm, but we all saw what happend with Brazil in WC!!! You can say whatever you want about Robben, but he can dribble as long as he want!!

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"From juventus.com, here are Conte's staff:

Angelo Alessio, Assistant Manager
Born in Capaccio di Scalo (Salerno) on 29th April 1965 (ed. 46 yo), Angelo Alessio is no stranger to the Bianconeri faithful, having represented Juventus 142 times, from 1987 to 1992, winning the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia in 1990. He met Conte as a teammate in his final season (1991/92). Alessio hung up his boots in 1998 and immediately embarked on a coaching career. He has worked with Antonio for a year, from the start of their successful adventure in Siena.

Cristian Stellini, Coach
Born in Cuggiono on 27th April 1974 (ed. 37 yo), Cristian Stellini enjoyed a long
playing career, representing Novara, Spal, Ternana, Como, Modena, Genoa and Bari. He won eight championships, four in Serie C and four in Serie B. He trained under Antonio Conte at Bari in 2008/2009, building a strong relationship with the manager and progressing to coaching the first team, following his retirement in 2010. Stellini assumed this role last season at Siena, culminating in promotion to the top division, and follows Conte to begin a new era at Juventus.

Paolo Bertelli, Professor, Fitness Coach
Paolo Bertelli, born in Firenze on 8th December 1960 (ed. 51 yo) has enjoyed a high profile career at the top level. He graduated in Motor Science and has been a professional fitness coach since 1987. His career began with Fiorentina, where he worked for twelve seasons with both the Youth Sector and the first team. After a year in Venice and another in Firenze, he arrived in Udine. Bertelli remained in Friuli for three years, before his long stay in the capital. He spent six richly successful campaigns with the Giallorossi and was named as the best Serie A fitness coach in 2008.

Claudio Filippi, Goalkeeping Coach
Having graduated from Roma’s ISEF University in 1989, becoming a professional athletic coach in 1994 and a UEFA coach in 1997, Claudio Filippi is one of the most highly regarded and best qualified goalkeeping coaches in Europe. He arrived at Juventus in 2010 following
experiences with Verona, Roma, Siena and two spells at Chievo. Filippi has introduced new training methods at Juventus, such as the machine that fires shots at the goalkeepers and the shield used to deflect crosses towards goal. These methods, coupled with more traditional training techniques, have been extremely efficient and are appreciated by Juve’s goalkeepers.

Imagine playing a CL final, who I am kidding, imagine playing a Coppa Italia final for our first piece of silverware after calciopoli and Felipe Melo kicking Robinho in the face … there goes our chances for the cup. Yes, Juve had physical players but most of them did things within the rules or at least didn't get caught (I can still appreciate Montero kicking Toni for being an idiot), F. Melo doesn't care what happens to the team after his tantrums.

The way I see it is we paid 25m for Felipe Melo and gave him a 5 year contract. He has played 2 years for us at a cost of 5m per year (forget salaries), so his value in our books is 15m. Given his form I think a club like Arsenal can be persuaded to take Melo for 18m. We make a small 3m profit and we can use the money to bring a player like Inler who although is not as beastly as Melo can provide us with great cover and will make the pieces of the midfield tick a little better.",JoseR ,"Jun 7, 2011 ", 3:42 PM,

Pretty balanced game so far. The biggest story so far, unfortunately, is the rain which is making a mess of the pitch. There have been several slips and slides throughout the match. Ireland up 1-0 on a superb strike off of a set piece. There only other dangerous ball of the half came off of a corner. I'm not sure what it is but both Juve and Italy have looked very poor in the defending of set pieces and definitely an area in need of improvement for both squads.

Italy controlled the ball nearly the entire half and created often while conceding little. Credit to the Irish defense which was compact in and around the box. Tappatoni's backline, coupled with the environmental factors, was able to stave off the Italian attack and score a surprise late goal at the end of the game on a counter. Italy's 2nd team looked promising in controlling possession despite the loss. Poor finishing and creativity from the Punti did the Azzurri in tonight. Italian fans shouldn't feel too discouraged by the seemingly one-sided result as the actual play was not reflected in the score. All in all not too upset and happy no one was hurt in bad conditions. Trappatoni completely out Italied Italy today and got the better of his pupil tactically.

Noticeable (Juventus-related) players:

Matri-had a miserable game and squandered each and every opportunity without threatening the goal despite quality service from backs, midfield. I guess this could be partially blamed on the pitch. He and Gillardino will not find room ahead of Rossi, Cassano, Balotelli, etc. with these performances.

Cassani-really want this guy on our team, he advanced well and made some precision passes without giving up ground defensively. Balzaretti is also quite nice but we have our LB's already.

Giovinco-teeming with gusto, he is a real pleasure to watch on counter attacks as he moves too quickly for defenses to keep track. His frenetic pace panics the opposition and makes them indecisive on whether to play him or the pass. Came painstakingly close on a couple free kicks as well.

Marchisio-can't think of anything too good or bad to say. Showed tactical skill far beyond Irish counterparts but that should be expected.

Chiellini-Looked like a boss out there. Did his job perfectly in the few times he was asked to do so.

Pirlo- played well and was rested after the first half.",FrancescoJuve ,"Jun 7, 2011 ", 6:41 PM,

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"PLEASE READ THIS AND THINK ABOUT THE SUSPECTED 'MOGGI SYSTEM' YOU'VE ALL READ ABOUT IN REGARDS TO CALCIOPOLI (LUCIANO BEING ACCUSED OF BEING TOO CLOSE WITH THE REFEREE DESIGNATORS AND HAVING EXCLUSIVE, JUVE-FAVORING CONTACTS) AND THINK ABOUT WHO OWNS THIS CLUB NOW AND THEIR ROLE IN THE 'SCANDAL':

This is an intercepted phone call between the two referee designators accused of being part of Moggi's system, Bergamo and Pairetto from March 6th, 2005. Gianni and Umberto Agnelli have been gone for quite a bit of time by the time this phone call took place, so all of Exor, Ifil, Juventus, La Stampa etc is now in the hands of the Elkanns.

Bergamo: I sense a lot of hostility toward Juventus, complete hostility eh!
Pairetto: Yes, yes, it's possible…
Bergamo: Who knows what's going on…honestly…you know that as far as we're concerned we could really care less…
Pairetto: Exactly, we have no reason to give a fuck ['a noi che cazzo ce ne frega'].
Bergamo: For us, as long as our job is done, it makes no difference who wins ['vinca uno o vinca l'altro']…

Later in the conversation, when speaking about Carraro (FIGC President from 01-06, a former Milan president and the same guy who in the summer of 06 was recorded as telling Bergamo that Lazio was in need of help and that the team could not get relegated to Serie B), Bergamo says:

“[…]I'm afraid there's someone, someone who conditions him and his decisions […] even this behavior of the Stampa of Turin [my note, he's talking about La Stampa's consistent and highly critical attitude from 04-06 towards mainly the federation and often even Juventus] […] the Stampa that attacks us when Juventus wins…and the Stampa is owned by the Agnellis…”

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"Well..as we remain stuck on this same page, I will chuck in my Melo profile, which is lengthy, but hopefully worth a read for those yet to read it via a link I posedt much further down…

When we signed Felipe Melo, in early July of 2009, I was happy, but also somewhat unknowing, of What we were buying for a then publicly stated EU25m. We had been courting D'agostino in the preceding weeks. Seemingly destined to procure him, but Pozzo kept upping the ante, and when it got to EU18m, negogitations froze, and within a handful of days, we signed Melo. at the time this seemed exciting and bizarre. Exciting…because i had seen Big Phil in action only in highlights of games, and more fully over the course of a whole game when Juve played fiorentina. In all those snippets, I saw a demonically uncompromising midfield hatchet man, with bravery and joy of the battle and carnage that ensues, happily married to brute physique and solid technical abilities on the ball. Bizarre…because we focused so much, on a regista, then, when the going got too tough, we instead signed a deranged, cultured and savage central midfielder. It was a strange move…similar in some way to Ranieri the Summer before, concluding that Alonso was too slow for Serie A, so let's get Poulsen. Neither of those moves make any sense whatsoever, given what led to them.In his first season at Juve, Felipe Melo was deployed…as…not a brutal midfield enforcer, but as a fucking regista. He failed there, as Gary Lineker would have failed had he been asked to play left wing( Lineker is the first name of Melo's son, who he named in homage to the former England star stiker…further evidence of Melo proving not quite right in the head, but interestingly so!)…To add to playing a starring role in Juve's worst season in 50 years or so, Melo went on to the world cup with Brazil, played okay in the games leading up to the quarter-final with Holland, then not only scored an own goal, but then cemented his nation's departure from the tournament by stamping on the pathetically flimsy Robben. The future of Melo looked far from bright…apparently, he was told by a team mate from the brazilian team that he shouldn't go back to Brazil…so, quite severe eh!To his credit, Melo returned to pre-season training with professionalism and desire to prove himself. Delneri must surely take some of the credit, as the two of them have been seen to be mutually fond, and perhaps all that Melo needed to regain his mental balance, and there in turn his form on the field, was a sincerely warm arm around his neck…there must be reasons for the impressive turn-around in form which transformed Melo from arch villain, to our player of the season; a man constantly bossing the midfield, with a natural regista playing alongside him he was able to find himself in his most natural position. Reading the play, intercepting attack after attack, playing the ball intelligently, shielding Aquilani, driving forward only with due diligence, timing tackles to perfection, fighting hard for every loose ball…and only ONCE, kicking someone in the face intentionally. It pains me to start believing the rumours that he is to be sold. the reaction to his recent criticisms of the club, leading to more speculation that he is on his way out. Because Felipe Melo…big fucking Phil…the madman i have grown to love so dearly…is the ONLY player in our present squad, other than Del Piero, who demonstrated constantly last season, a horrible, horrible, season, the grinta, that we were renowned for, globally..before 2006. This last season, Melo became a true juventino to me. I often criticize not marchisio himself, but the high opinions of him of other juve supporters. Claudio loves the club, feels part of the club, and has as much determination as he can muster. He has a definitely stronger connection to the club than Melo…but…Melo's determination is more useful to the team. Much more. I can accept Melo, once, or at most twice per season, kicking someone in the face, especially if it is completely uncalled for…In some awful way, that actually endears him to me more, for it adds to our armaments, a serious Fear factor. Opponents will be thinking…'that melo cunt is going to kick me in the face, maybe take an eye out…best avoid him like the plague'. Who would you be more confident of going in against for a 50/50 ball? Melo or Marchisio?This leads me onto another topic, which I will touch upon as briefly as possible, as this is supposed to be the Melo thread!We used to have players who made the opposition scared by the reputation of their talent, and also their physical strength, and also their brutality. We now lack all of those kinds of Fear factor. Teams play us without fear of us brutalizing them or embarassing them with our superior technique. we need to focus on improving the techincal level of the squad, and also the Menace of the squad. Chiellini goes in hard, but always fair, never nasty. But Terry? Vidic? Samuel?…Davids?Tachinardi?Montero?Kohler?even Zidane(who as gorgeously gifted with god given technique as he was, there was also a very obvious streak of physical venom about him)?As a team, we lack both players whose talent alone scares the opposition, and also players whose mentality and brute physicality scares the opposition. Melo is a player who adds something to our overall technique levels, and adds much to our fear factor in a more Warrior-like manner. My adoration for the man, is not confined to his abilities needed purely throughout the course of the mechanics of a football match, its the way his character shines through which brings me the most joy. His dance against the Milanese ranks as something truly special, for all time. it was something very, very weird, but also brilliant at the same time, it was exactly what the swine deserved, and nobody knew how to react…I also greatly enjoyed the roll after Toni clipped him, which was ridiculous, not merely 'simulation'. And even though it ruined the dreams of a whole nation, I approved greatly and proudly of seeing him crunch robben…that fucker had it coming. Its also amusing and very rare to see players of our own team, have their natural joy at scoring a goal suddenly checked, by the advance of Melo towards them…For he comes at them like a man possessed. I get the impression that some of the others in our squad are scared of him, as in they just smile when this giant baby plays his 'tricks' on them…and seems to enter into a dangerous to anyone within 6 feet trance, in which he shakes violently, or worse, and more damaging to our reputation, does that strange very camp chicken dance, which he introduced to the world against Milan…he will never truly grow up into what most of see as adulthood, but he will bring us far more joy and success than dismay.truly, more than any other player in the squad, i hope he stays.",thegutterpoet ,"Jun 7, 2011 ", 9:28 PM,

Dro have made an official request to the sporting judge, they believe the ref made a mistake, although the rules state it's all perfectly legal since the ball hit one of the posts prior.

I was aiming to broach the topic of our present complete flimsiness other than Melo, when in the past we had a physical edge and technical edge. Also..In our colours, Melo has not been any worse than most other central mainly comabtive midfielders, in terms of ill discipline. There is a very childish part of me that likes what I call Crunchers…Melo fits that mould, but he can also play to a high standard, and whichever way I look at this last season, his form, Sorensen's appearance and Quagiarella's rich streak before his injury are the ONLY positives I can take.

http://lavecchiasignora.net/ph…

Any connection to the dream of Aguero has died a forseeable long ago death on the vine…Sanchez appears to have far more enticing suitors…blame Marotta if you are a fucking idiot, but if you are more tempered by reality, look at it as it looks to Kun: Juve, with not even the europa league to play with, two world class players, a project that has faltered now for two years, a team on the slide, OR, several other teams, all of whom can offer the upper echelons of european competition AND a definite stab at the domestic league title AND better wages AND surrounded by far more world class players…that is not marrota's fault, its basic economics.

So…that leaves us presently perhaps, hopefuly, focused on the troublesome RB and LW positions. Lichsteiner/Beck…both we seem to have interest in, and whilst i am happy if we sign either one of them, grabbing both would be preferable. The rumours that appeared about Perotti, unfortunately seem to have vanished as abuptly as they appeared, but I hope, there is no smoke without fire…for the argie looks at least potentially equal to our other main target for that position, Bastos….who we remain linked with. And the interesting pasrt of the potential Bastos move, is that we seem to be waiting, as Marotta inferred himself, for Bastos to get his frog passport…i would be happy for his arrival. but i keep repeating…if bastos can ONLY be signed as an EU player, then logic suggests that Marotta has a player, destined for our one and only non-eu position, who is clearly much more talented than Bastos.

Who can this non-eu player be?

we are linked with bastos(seemingly hinging upon him gaining EU status/passport), Lichstenier, Inler, Beck…where is our one and only non-eu purchase desire aimed? I have a feeling it could be Neymar. It must be someone special, else why bother to demand of bastos, make it publicly clear that the bastos move is hinging upon him gaining EU status/passport?? The brazilian appelt brothers we are signing have access to european passports, and both are young and unproven. Beck is pure krout…lichsteiner and inler are so easily already EU…so…with only ONE transfer allowed for a non-eu player, who can that be/???",thegutterpoet ,"Jun 8, 2011 ", 9:18 AM,

Inler's agent saying that things with Juve have cooled down and he expects Inler to sign for Napoli in a couple of weeks. Maybe his agent is just trying to put pressure on Marotta, who knows.

I read somewhere else that Juve's real target is the mediano from Porto (Fernando or Rolando, i forgot his name), he looks solid but who knows.

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"I think the mercatto confusion is coming from Marotta not being prepared for Conte. From Marotta's interviews after sacking Delneri I always got the sense that he wanted to keep Delneri for one more year, I think the players also wanted to stay with Delneri given the kind words they all had for him when the coach left. I imagine someone else in the management or a majority of the management (Paratici, Nedved, or even Andrea Agnelli) agreed that Delneri's time had come and so it was they got Conte.

Now it seems that Conte comes with his requests (as he should) and Marotta needs to scrap a bunch of plans he already had in mind. For instance, with Delneri we would have kept Aquilani, Melo, and Quagliarella for sure, Sissoko would have been on his way out. Pirlo and Ziegler would have come for sure along with Bastos and one or two quality RBs. On the other hand, Conte would prefer a player like Inler over Aquilani and I think he has other ideas for a RW. Pirlo and Ziegler were free and good options for the team so no one in their right mind would have refused those players. This essentially means that if we had been negotiating for Bastos secretly for a few months now that goes out the window. Same with Liverpool and Aquilani. Now Marotta has to start from scratch approaching presidents like Pozzo or Lotito who are tough negotiators, have no reason to sell, and know full well our needs.

I really hope this was not the case and the confusion is due to only the media but as it seems our targets changed too quickly when for me after the Fiorentina game the management should have been thinking about other coaching options and trying to start negotiations for players that are of interest to the coach",JoseR ,"Jun 8, 2011 ", 4:37 PM,

Grab a Kleenex box prior to reading this. Your computer will thank you down the road.

When contacted as a phone-in guest during the show Speciale Calciomercato of Sportitalia, renowned football agent Andrea D'Amico surprisingly revealed that his client “Sebastian Giovinco is set to remain at Juventus, as per new manager Conte's wish”.
On the other hand, it seems that the black and white club is looking to offload Vincenzo Iaquinta, another famous client of D'Amico. According to the agent: “it would be a huge mistake because Iaquinta is one of Juve's strongest players”.

Intriguing. Where will Seba line up?

I think Adam mentioned in one of the podcasts that the Non-EU player rule will probably be reversed back to two players a season. The reason is the division of Serie A TV rights revenue. As it now stands the “smaller” clubs will get a larger share. The bigger clubs have used the Non-EU player rule as a bargaining chip in negotiations if they are to accept the small clubs demands. That's what I understood of the podcast at least, correct me if I'm wrong!

What do you guys think of Vargas for the LW? Seems strange that there are no transfer rumors about him!? Corvino perhaps knows how to keep the press away from his players!? In my opinion getting Vargas, Lichtsteiner, and Inler would be enough to guarantee a Champions League spot nex year. Perhaps one more player to reenforce the squad in January.

Even something as simply as adding Vargas to the squad, as a challenger to Giovinco on either of two positions. Lw, or LWF.

The news about Iaquinta…who cares? really? He did well at times, but has done nothing for many moons now. Its little defence to say 'he has been injured!!!!' because that is one of the problems. which are part of him, as a piece of capital. even releasing him for 0, easing up the wage bill a little, to invest on fresh blood, would be fine by me. Ciao VinnyCenzo…

back to this possible, apparently very close to likely, re-acquisition, of giovinco…A majority seem to believe/ assume that COnte will adopt his tried and tested 4-2-4. We were linked with Bastos long before Conte was anywhere near even serious consideration for the manager position. Pirlo, i assume the same.

I can understand Marotta grabbing Pirlo…whilst attempting a close to insulting offer to purchase Aquilani. 6m that did make me chuckle to read. Cheeky Beppe!…Pirlo is 32. but has world class ability, that can be shown regularly, if his flesh and bones can remain healthy. His seriously special abilities on the ball can be of more use to us, with our present team around him, than Aquilani. Pirlo surely has been told that he is part of first team plans, else he wouldn't have signed.

That fact alone, challenges the 'Conte 4-2-4' mould that the majority of juventini seem to be working their prospective first XIs into the shape of.

Conte's 4-2-4 needs wingers who are far more offensive than defensive. also strong fullbacks, defensively and offensively…above all else, a competency and both LB and LM, as the two become combined in such a formation. for the midfield to have ONLY two pretty much always centrally based midfielders, often digging deep to defend, but rarely truly investing themselves forward, a pairing which will often come up against at least 2-3 opponents, hoping to beat them, or spray the ball wide…of such a pairing, we need TWO beasts. One is not enough. If the Inler rumours are true, and we sign him. I will be very impressed with Marotta, and Conte, if they end up deploying a central midfield of:
Melo Pirlo Inler
Add to that the defence
Buffon
Lichsteiner Bonucci Chiellini Ziegler

And we are looking hugely stronger already.

Now we already have krasic, and likely matri…seemingly also giovinco…and quagiarella.

Buffon
Lichsteiner/beck bonucci/barzagli chiellini ziegler/de ceglie
melo/pazienza pirlo inler/marchisio
bastos/quag matri/toni giovinco/krasic

In American Football, we have players called change-of-pace backs. Essentially they are dynamic and unconventional running backs whose value derives from their unique style of play. Their introduction is meant to befuddle the opponent. In other words, the opposition is required to defend an unorthodox player in a traditional, innefective way or shift the defensive scheme which leaves weaknesses for the rest of the offense to exploit. Giovinco fits this role aptly. His size (lack thereof) is seemingly a weakness but also carries with it these positives.

They are both good players, especially Pasquato who's 22 and has already played something like >100 professional games (mostly in Serie B) and just had a solid Serie B season in terms of appearances and productivity.

There's no point in loaning these two out anymore, especially Ekdal.

Marrone needs more experience, preferably in A, he needs to play a >30 game season.
Rossi is staying on co-ownership at Vicenza next year and he also needs more experience. A or B it doesn't matter, he just needs to play a >30 game season and stay healthy (injury prone as fuck).
Immobile=same as Rossi's situation – injury proneness.
Libertazzi needs to go out on loan, Serie B will do just fine.
Pinsoglio needs to go back out on loan, at least to a Serie B team.
Daud=same as Pinsoglio's situation. After nearly disappearing at Gubbio in C1 during the beginning of the season, he got healthy once again, started scoring quite a bit and put the team on his back, helping them get promoted to Serie B. He should stay at Gubbio now that he's established himself there and they are in B.
Giandonato needs to go out on loan, he's good enough for a small A club but if he gets loaned out to a B team and plays >30 games that'll do him good.

Sorensen should stay with the first squad.",jorid22 ,"Jun 9, 2011 ", 1:21 PM,

I'm a little confused by the disagreement from the both of you. As I said, I am happy to have Matri with the team and think he will have a great season provided he gets good service. He, however, does not provide any advantage (in fact the opposite) when juxtaposed with the top scorers from the other ECL contenders in Serie A. To think otherwise is delusional.

And the jewels of their (shitty and paper) crown:
- E'too's family kept receiving racial abuse and wanna leave Milan and Italy asap;
- Sneijder, even after he proclaimed his love for the merda, continues to look for a greener pasture in EPL, particularly in Russian-side of London, the red-side of Manchester, and the blue-side of Manchester.

Of those three players, certainly Pasquato has shown the most steady improvement, with Marrone second and Immobile a paltry third. How have I come to these rankings???well…Christian Pasquato has certainly excelled at Modena. He seems a player very close to a Del Piero mould, who can ONLY prosper if given the freedom of a position which allows his natural talent on the ball to shine through. Almost ALL of his goals at Modena have been spectacular, several of them beautifully produced free kicks…He can also assist, and has very obvious skill on the ball. MArrone managed a decent amount of performances within a team which gained promotion…as for Immobile, he has faltered. But that may well be due to unknown factors. He was so damn prolific for the primavera that he simply cannot have lost that knack for goalscoring. If we are getting Matri, a prima punta, already proven brilliant, in a struggling team, where clear cut chances come few and far between, then I doff my virtual hat in deference to Marotta, for making such a move permanent, spending 10m CASH in the process…as reliable prima puntas are extremely hard to come by these days. and Matri seems to suit Juve, as much as Juve suits him.

A. Do you want another center back and if so: Who should leave to make space ?
B. Do you really think this will happen or are you just hoping ?
C. Where does that leave Sorensen ?


For me it makes sense, since Conte's game starts from the back and Bonucci – Chiellini is not the most comfortable pairing at the back when in possession.

I'd welcome it as well, not only for the above mentioned reason, but also since we're missing that tactical leader in defence. I shouldn't say much more, that has been covered multiple times; Bonucci and Chiellini aren't very complementary.

I'd like Sorensen to either find a team where he can truly start every game or to stay with us as a CB backup. I'd prefer to have Beck AND Lichtsteiner on the right, so that we finally have that position locked for sure. Don't think keeping Sorensen there as a primary backup would do us any good, since we all know what happens when you don't have a decent second choice.",Robee ,"Jun 10, 2011 ", 8:24 AM,

- In addition to Lichtsteiner, Beck wants Juve and he can join us for 5mil and be Stephan's understudy. However, we have to loose Motta and Grygera first.

- We don't want to pay 18mil so Inler is going to Napoli. As a result, we're talking to RM about a possible swap deal between Lass Diarra and Melo.

- Bastos is close, costs around 15 mil, but Conte wants Ribery.
- Vargas is available for 13mil. Juve, Milan and Liverpool are interested.

- Turned out Barca only offered 22mil + Krkic, who didn't even want to go to Udine. Sanchez' agent then went to RM. As it stands now, the merda are the favorite for offering 20mil + Santon, Ramirez, and Coutinho/Mariga. Juve offered 20mil + De Ceglie and Ekdal/Giandonato.

- So far, only Juve made inquiries about Kun Aguero (That 45mil price tag must scare everyone away). Mourinho said that he's interested but nobody else, including RM, has made any inquiries. Kun said that he'd make his decision after Copa America.


Current players:

- Motta will be made permanent and then Beppe will try to move him (Wouldn't it make more sense to just not purchase him? Maybe it's a forced loan). He has his admirers in Spain or can be used in a co-ownership deal with Lazio or Parma. Grosso will go to Dubai. A Turkish team has an interest on Grygera.

- Melo does not has a place in Conte's plan but Sissoko will stay.

- Nothing on Martinez, except from the previous news that he will be used to pay for Motta's full rights and Pepe's 2.5mil installment this year. If Udinese agree.

- Giovinco will be back because Conte wants him. Amauri will be used (maybe a co-ownership) so Parma won't exercise their rights to take Gio's option.

- Nothing on Iaquinta and Toni.",dwicarta ,"Jun 10, 2011 ", 8:42 AM,

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"Its very hard to judge Marchisio from this last season. Partly, because as a team, we failed in every aim, And also, because CLaudio was played out of his natural position for most of the season. His passion for the club has never, and will never be in doubt. His techique and concentration are both classy. However, his perhaps unfortunate, but still factual, inability to find a position, and prove so potent, that the position is made his own, worries me a fair amount. He had zero chance of dislodging Melo, once Big Phil found his form. Instead, he was used initially as a blockade to numb the Maicon threat, and also to protect De Ceglie, then more often, as what I have read and heard called a mezz'ala. Perhaps there is someone who can shed light, definitively on this term???? Whatever its actual meaning, Marchisio was deployed as a left sided central midfielder, pushing out wide at times, but rarely foraging forward to any substantial value, instead, more often, bunching up with Melo and Aquilani to make a central trio of midfielders. With Krasic as a right wing forward, but asked to track back, even if only to get the ball and bomb forward…

Whilst we had Quagiarella fit and moving beautifully around the opposing half, everything was fine. For there were always people to pass to, our movement offensively was good enough to allow the defensive elements to clean up well whatever they had to deal with. Unfortunately, when quagiarella got crunched, our offensive movement became awful, static, predictable…and it was then, that many players seemed terrible, marchisio was one of them…not for playing badly, but for going hour after hour, completely uninvolved, completely unable to impose himself on a game, often…invisible. a phantom.

He has recently signed a new 5 year contract, with improved terms, befitting a loyal servant of the club. Presently, I cannot consider him, on last season's form, as a potential vital cog of a Juve first XI which could take us back to where we belong; the very summit of domestic and european football. I may well be wrong…and I would be happy to see him involved, if the rest of the team was massively more talented and connected, so he would be a worker bee. A darren fletcher of sorts.

The way things are looking, we will have Pirlo, Inler/Defour, Marchisio, Pazienza, and maybe Melo…Pirlo is going to play. He would not have signed on as a bench player. Andrea is fantastic on the ball, but a lightweight when it comes to tackling and hustling. My opinion is that he needs TWO hustlers around him…preferably one more defensive, and one still able to tackle and hustle, but also decent at passing and intelligent on the ball…Pirlo's inclusion in the squad lends to a 4-3-3.

If Melo remains, as I hope he does, as he is my favourite player of last season, and I suspect his recent quotes are been taken wildly out of context, and we sign one of Defour or Inler, without any doubt, we are going for a midfield trio.Melo Pirlo Inler/Defourwith marchisio the obvious challenger, mainly to inler/defour and melo.

I totally agree we should try to get Leichsteiner and Beck to lock that position but they won't be cheap. For Leichsteiner I think Marotta is aiming at 8m and Lotito wants 12m and it might end up for 6m + Storari or 10m total. Beck won't come for any less than 7m. If we swap Melo for Lass, lets assume we do a straight swap (if we buy Inler we will pay from the Melo purchase) which leaves us 20m for a LW. I don't think we have much more money than that unless we are thinking about selling Bonucci, Chiellini or Sorensen.

If it is a question of whether we need a CB or not I would say that buying a new CB who is not a known leader (ie. Vidic) won't really help matters that much.

1. Go this year with the current 4 CB's and with the Chiellini-Bonucci partnership in order to see how it behaves after a full season together and how much of a difference the new fullbacks will have on it.
2. Before and during number 1 takes place, hope Mats Hummels stays at BVB for at least one more season and show some preliminary interest in him (not in the media but scouting him, making an inquiry to Borussia).
3a. If the partnership seems better during the 11-12 season and works fairly successfully, abandon number 2.
3b. If the partnership seems to not have improved in its second year even after good fullbacks are purchased, bench the weaker of the two CB's and make Mats Hummels the #1 mercato priority for the 2012 summer.
4. POSSESS A DEFENSE EVEN MORE IMPREGNABLE THAN MIKE TYSON'S AND PROCEED TO RAPE EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

Why Hummels? He's fantastic. Plays with confidence, intelligent in his movement and actions, knows just when to go forward and contribute in play-making, great physically, young and Bayern management have been slapping themselves across the face constantly at the thought of having let him go.

Try to download this past season's Bayern-Borussia game that took place in Allianz Arena and finished 1-3 for BVB if you can. Hummels was easily MOTM and had 0 problems against guys like Robben.",jorid22 ,"Jun 10, 2011 ", 2:40 PM,

I'd love to see Aguero in black and white someday.. Regardless it will be extremely difficult. close to a miracle i think, for us to sign him..",Juventisawi ,"Jun 10, 2011 ", 4:18 PM,

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"Since the 2010/11 season ends, there's an obvious pattern in our mercato plans:

1. From day one until now, the media focus on our pursuit of a world-class seconda punta: First Kun Aguero, then Sanchez.

2. Also from day one until now, we keep having rumors of adding CMs, particularly the more defensive CMs. Inler went from being almost a done deal to nothing. Now the Lass Diarra cycle started. At the same time, Aquilani is getting farther and farther.

3. We took care our most problematic positions: Fullbacks. First, we added Ziegler for LB. Then, Lichtsteiner is coming for RB. There's also rumors that we'd still take Beck even with Lichtsteiner in the squad.

4. With Lichtsteiner almost official, we now have escalating rumors about adding a CB.

It's getting clearer and clearer that our main focus in this summer's mercato is fixing/strengthening our foundation (read: defense; the back four and the shielding CMs) while aiming to inject the attacking force with a significant/world-class quality player.

Couldn't agree more with the direction with the mercato. So potentially:

Buffon
Lichtsteiner/Beck—Bonucci/Barzagli—Chiellini/??—Ziegler/PDC
Krasic/Martinez—Lass/Sissoko—Pirlo/Marchisio—Vargas/Pepe
Matri/Toni—Aguero/ADP
(Still don't know where to put Giovinco in this formation).

At LW, it could be Vargas/Bastos/Ribery. At SS, it could be Aguero/Sanchez/Rossi, or stay with Quags.

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"I liked the recap but I think a few of those rumors are unfounded:

1) I don't know if we will get a world class seconda punta and keep Quags. I guess Atletico has said that Juventus has been the only one to inquire about Kun but I don't think it has gone beyond that.

2) Strong CM I think are a reality. I think Conte wants them and Marotta is going to oblige, we conceded way too many goals last season and bringing in another destroyer can only be a good thing.

3) Leichsteiner is far from secured. Lotito was laughing at the newspapers that were saying the deal was done. He said he didn't know anyone else besides him could sell Lazio players and he hasn't agreed to anything. He is dead set on 12m and knows the other descent fullbacks in Italy (Maggio, Cassani) will not come to Juve for less than 12m so he can sleep easily. This is the cost of rebuilding, thanks Alessio, your legacy lives on.

4) Another CB will happen only if we sell Chiellini or Bonucci for an obscene amount of money. You know, those deals were Man City buys Pique for 50m and then Barca buys Vidic for 45m, and then Man U buys Chiellini for 40+Macheda?, in which case we end up buying the Porto CB, or try out with Kjaer and Bonucci. Or even go up to Inter and buy Ranocchia for 30m just because we can. In other words a good CB is just a plan in case of emergency.

I think Marotta will get us Leichstener but he won't come cheap (maybe giving them Storari in a way in which Marotta can save face). 6m + Storari, or something like that. I also think he will get us a CM and we will get rid of Melo. Lastly, I think if we are going to buy a 20m+ player it will be a LW and not a seconda punta. After that he will just try to sell Amauri, Tiago, Melo, Grosso, Grygera, Martinez, and Iaquinta. That sounds like a full plate for Marotta this summer.",JoseR ,"Jun 11, 2011 ", 3:21 AM,

"VotD: The New Boss, Same As the Old Boss",The Offside Juventus,"Jun 2, 2011, 6:52pm PDT",,"His agent apparently said earlier today that his client, Giovinco, is going to return to Juventus, as COnte has requested him…also that another of his clients, Vincezno Iaquinta is set to be discared…“Sebastian Giovinco is set to remain at Juventus, as per new manager Conte's wish”….“(iaquinta)…it would be a huge mistake because Iaquinta is one of Juve's strongest players”.(Andrea D'Amico )

If there is truth to Giovinco's agent actually saying that, literally confirming that la formica atomica is heading to our first team dquad for this summer and next season, then I am happy. Even something as simply as adding Vargas to the squad, as a challenger to Giovinco on either of two positions. Lw, or LWF.

The news about Iaquinta…who cares? really? He did well at times, but has done nothing for many moons now. Its little defence to say 'he has been injured!!!!' because that is one of the problems. which are part of him, as a piece of capital. even releasing him for 0, easing up the wage bill a little, to invest on fresh blood, would be fine by me. Ciao VinnyCenzo…

back to this possible, apparently very close to likely, re-acquisition, of giovinco…A majority seem to believe/ assume that COnte will adopt his tried and tested 4-2-4. We were linked with Bastos long before Conte was anywhere near even serious consideration for the manager position. Pirlo, i assume the same.

I can understand Marotta grabbing Pirlo…whilst attempting a close to insulting offer to purchase Aquilani. 6m that did make me chuckle to read. Cheeky Beppe!…Pirlo is 32. but has world class ability, that can be shown regularly, if his flesh and bones can remain healthy. His seriously special abilities on the ball can be of more use to us, with our present team around him, than Aquilani. Pirlo surely has been told that he is part of first team plans, else he wouldn't have signed.

That fact alone, challenges the 'Conte 4-2-4' mould that the majority of juventini seem to be working their prospective first XIs into the shape of.

Conte's 4-2-4 needs wingers who are far more offensive than defensive. also strong fullbacks, defensively and offensively…above all else, a competency and both LB and LM, as the two become combined in such a formation. for the midfield to have ONLY two pretty much always centrally based midfielders, often digging deep to defend, but rarely truly investing themselves forward, a pairing which will often come up against at least 2-3 opponents, hoping to beat them, or spray the ball wide…of such a pairing, we need TWO beasts. One is not enough. If the Inler rumours are true, and we sign him. I will be very impressed with Marotta, and Conte, if they end up deploying a central midfield of:Melo Pirlo Inler Add to that the defence
BuffonLichsteiner Bonucci Chiellini Ziegler
And we are looking hugely stronger already.

Now we already have krasic, and likely matri…seemingly also giovinco…and quagiarella. Buffon
Lichsteiner/beck bonucci/barzagli chiellini ziegler/de ceglie
melo/pazienza pirlo inler/marchisio
krasic/quag matri/toni giovinco/bastos

That team, with the right dose of luck, and COnte managing to infuse into the team as a whole, a contagious sense of belief in and demand for success, could reach 3rd, or perhaps even second…

Nedved and Camo weren't starters because their contract said so, or because they cornered Moggi, Capello, or Lippi into making them first team choices. They were there because they were the best.

Juventus Football Club S.p.A. announces that an agreement has been finalized with Paris Saint-Germain Football for the disposal of the registration rights of the player Mohamed Lamine Sissoko for a consideration of € 7 million to be paid in three years. The economic effect on 2011/2012 financial year will be positive for about € 2.8 million.

Furthermore, should Paris Saint-Germainqualify to the Group Stage of the UEFA Champions League before September 2013, an additional consideration of € 1 million shall be due to Juventus.

Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"I have been looking for an article in which Marotta clearly states that the arrival of Vucinic does not mean that Juve won't be going for Rossi as well. I think he was thinking the same thing as you John: Vucinic as a LW and Rossi as a Seconda Punta.

With regards to defenders I agree with you. If Lugano comes, then Bonucci can head out for Vargas and Kjaer can come in (which will mean Vucinic doesn't come to Juve). I personally would like this scenario better but it is more expensive. Lugano will cost about 3.5m, Vargas will come for Bonucci + at least 2m and Kjaer will come for about 10-12m (my guess). So we are talking 12+2+3.5=17.5 give or take. Vucinic will come for about 12-13m so 5 to 6m cheaper which can then be used to bring in Rossi.

The other question is the desire for the players the come and the clubs to sell. Clearly Roma wants to sell Vucinic, Villarreal doesn't want to sell Rossi. As for Fiorentina I don't know how willingly they will part ways with Vargas. The Kjaer situation is a little worse, I would say that if we show up with 12m to Wolfsburg they would take it most of the days but they rescinded Diego's contract and they still have to pay us money. I think Hoeness would want to charge us 15m for Kjaer (11m his real price + 3-4m from the Diego deal). In this case a savvy DS would get Parma to buy Kjaer for 10m and then sell him to us for Amauri + cash (Moggi would have done something sly like that).

At the end of the day I rather have

We need strikers that are world class talents. Quags/Matri border that level but i dont think theyre there. Rossi is a great talent and if he assimilates to serie a, he is the world class player.

Bonucci won't be any part of the exchange deal, simply because he has massive potentials (Defenders mature later) and we paid a good amount of dough (15???) for him. But Vucinic, why don't we just save that money for next year if we are indeed getting Vucinic, how is he an upgrade for this Juventus front line? I feel sick in my stomach at this moment.

As for the mercato, I believe Marotta is chasing Vucinic for the left wing. The Vucinic rumour has started when we were still hot on Aguero and Rossi, and the Vargas rumour in this mercato has only started when the move for Vucinic came to a stall. Regarding Rossi, I don't really think we need to push really hard for him and spend most of the transfer money on him. It will be really great if he comes as we will have a world class striker, but even if he didn't, I believe we wouldn't have a hard time to score as long as we get a top class left winger.

Motta was a horror show as usual. I think he is actually the love child of Zebina and Moratti come to haunt Juve with his douche hair and complete indifference to putting in a solid shift. For a guy in the crosshairs he sure trotted around the field like a legend a lot.

My only concern was the final third play. So many times last year we rushed our play, relied on sloppy long balls, and turned over the ball far to easily. On to many occasions I saw that old team over the last week. We need to learn possession football to take pressure off the back line and keep opposing teams from pushing up.

Quagliarella played a good game too, looking very sharp. He did a good job linking up with the mid fielders.The commentator mentioned numerous times that Juventus has a rather simple tactics which I believe is quit true. Defenders to center midfielders, quick pass to one of our strikers, then spreading the pass out wide, leads to early crosses in the end (very little dribbling out wide, really really early crosses). I think this is one of the reasons that pepe was hugely involved in the first half, however his crosses were mostly blocked. I thought everyone played well in the first half except Motta. Motta was aweful in the first half, he still doesn't know how to position his body or turn when defending one on one, numerous bad challenges (missed the ball most of the time). In contrast to the second game, when forrest was playing, he didn't run up supporting the winger very much, neither did ziegler. I thought Pazienza and Bonucci both had a solid game. Paziezan had some really good tackles. Bonnuci was calm when defending couple of key clearance. Um what else??? Oh yeah, we are in dying need of a left footed winger.

He was a late bloomer, and more European than Brazilian in terms of playing style, hence he never really shone with the Selecao. He's like Pirlo but with shorter range of pass and more mobile.

In terms of Free kick, he's better than Pirlo, IMO. He was the one who invented that “kick the ball with 3 toes” technique that was copied by Pirlo, and then Del Piero, and to some extent, CR7 (tho in CR7's case, he puts more power and hopes for the best). His free kicks are often mentioned to have the knuckle ball effect, where the ball moves unpredictably, often making the goalkeeper wrongfooted.

Finally, he was Real Madrid's ultimate nightmare in ECL Quarterfinals. Search for “Madrid Lyon Juninho” in youtube to get the drift.

Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"So apparently Juve have agreed a transfer for Vucinic with Roma. The details of the operation are all over the map:

- Juve offered 14m+1m bonus
- Roma wanted 15m+1m bonus
- Juve will pay 15m+3m bonus

It seems unclear which one of these scenarios is the right one. I personally would be satisfied with the first 2, the last one seems excessive. a 3.5m/year salary for the next 4 years is what everyone is talking about right now.

If this were true, it reminds me of last year when we tried to get Di Natale and we ended signing Quagliarella (change Di Natale for Rossi, and Quags for Vucinic). A little bit of an impulse buy.

To rate this transfer I think we need to see what else is happening with the team in terms of transfers. If Amauri and Iaquinta are out then we are left with ADP, Quags, Matri and Toni. ADP will play a meaningful role this season but he won't be our main attacking threat. Quags and Matri are probably our starters. Toni well… he is like an Amauri that can actually score more than 5 goals a season, but I don't see him breaking 10 goals this year (if he does I will apologize publicly). Vucinic can play both prima and seconda punta and offers us a descent option if Matri or Quags get injured or suspended (be honest, would you rather start with Toni or Vucinic on your team).

Moreover, Toni's contract expires next year and a replacement for him had to be found (unless we wanted Iaquinta or Amauri to replace Toni).

Now, I don't think Vucinic comes for 15m and a 3.5m/year contract to sit on the bench. I think he will be our starting LW or LF (in a 4-3-3) for next season, and if Conte succeeds for the next few seasons. The substitute for the left side I think has to be Pasquato. While De Silvestri is good, I don't think he is up to the challenge yet. The other option will be Martinez who has qualities of both Vucinic and Pasquato but is not nearly at good as them.

Lastly, if you wanted Rossi and not Vucinic and you are a Moggi lover, then you should know Moggi himself said that Vucinic would fit Conte's tactics way better than Rossi. He called Rossi a little too weak for what Conte needs.

At the end of the day, like any other football team, we will see on the pitch how this experiment pans out (unless you are Inter in which case they rather try success using wiretaps).",JoseR ,"Jul 29, 2011 ", 2:34 PM,

- @dwicarta:disqus seems to think Vucinic will be our seconda punta and Quags his backup. If he is right, then we are still on the market for a LW. Other news sites say that Juve's top player will be a new LW which suggests we are still thinking of a 4-4-2.

Is Vucinic a bad player? No, certainly not. Can he be useful? Sure. Is he the world-class player we were told to expect? No.

Put all the other names we've bought this transfer season, very good transfers like Licht, Vidal, etc, and it looks like a decent campaign, doesn't it? Maybe.

Did Agnelli and Marotta promise “a few world-class players, champions, not lots of players” after having bought “workmanlike players to build the foundation last year”? They certainly did. Oh yes, they did.

Now, have they delivered on that specific promise? Please, be honest.

Yeah, you can make all kinds of excuses (they really tried, but world-class players are too expensive, they don't want to come to Juve because of lack of CL football, etc), and add real positives (Vucinic, Vidal, Licht, etc are all fine players, they should be useful, etc), but it does not add up to the promise being fulfilled. I am quite happy with most of the transfers, too, but it doesn't change the facts.

When he was asked about it he said that he will bring champions and then the reporter asked him. Do you think Vucinic is a champion?, and he said: yes, Juve are looking at that kind of a player. So he very clearly stated that in his mind, a big signing would be that of Vucinic.

Now, I don't agree with Vucinic being a game changer, and to be honest, I think Marotta, Agnelli, and Paratici thought they can bring Sergio Aguero, Sanchez, or Rossi. The problem is that their prices are overinflated. Sanchez will cost Barca 37m, is that what Juve should be paying? I don't think so. Aguero was rumored to cost 45m, again, an insanity. Rossi was I believe within reach until they sold Cazorla and then the opportunity was gone.

You need to also look at who are the top player Italy has attracted in the last 3 years?. Ibrahimovic was snapped because his club didn't want him at all (not the case of Aguero, Sanchez or Rossi). Robinho, hardly a game changer. Pato?, he was brought as a promise and in my mind he is nowhere near what was expected of him. Snejider, same situation as Ibra (and at a hefty cost). Juventus can't offer the top players the salaries they want, specially if those players are in England, or Spain.

At the end of the day, Juve need to buy smart and develop talent, there will be no other way to compete. Vidal may be considered a champion by May next year, who knows?. Vucinic work rate may improve 10-fold under Conte. Juve will not buy a player that costs 45m and demands a 6m salary per year for 5 years (with Italy's taxes, that would cost close to 100m over the next 5 years).",JoseR ,"Jul 29, 2011 ", 4:57 PM,

There has been an obvious increase in quality to our starting eleven with the addition to Licht, Ziegler, Pirlo, and Vidal (I'm still indifferent with Pazienza's signing).

If you remember, until the winter break last season, we were challenging for Scudetto. Seeing how the quality has increased this year and our weak areas (fullbacks and left wing) has been (or will be in case of the left wing) sorted out, I'm optimistic that we can realistically challenge for the Scudetto this season.

One more reason that gets me optimistic is I'm seeing Juve building a team like the all dominating Juventus in the mid-late 90s. Torricelli and Di Livio have crafted their name as the club's legend now. But, if Marotta try to sign players like them now (from an amateur team and from Serie B) he will be criticized heavily. And I haven't mentioned other stars such as Conte (came from Lecce) and Davids (failing at Milan). Look how they turned out to be. They guided us through one of the club's most successful period. If you compare, Vucinic and Lugano has bigger reputation compared to Torricelli and Di Livio when they first signed. What says Vucinic can't be world class for us?

Vucinic knows the league and can play as seconda punta or LW. Moggi (who I assume you think is not a provnicial SD) himself said Vucinic would suit Conte's tactics better than Rossi.

1) Calling Vucinic a champion takes us back to the old discussion about provincial mindset, and rightly so.

2) The whole argument of “we couldn't do any better anyway” doesn't convince me. It is too defeatist. If we had 30-35 mil to offer for Aguero (and if we're to believe the newspapers, we did), we surely could come up with 45. No, what's determining here is Marotta's internal drive to always get a “good deal,” which is something I admire, because I share that sensibility almost to an obsession when I buy cars, etc. but this is Juve we're talking about.

What refly said a few posts below is something I completely agree with, which is “we make champions” out of players who had either no reputation before, or had uneven careers, so there's that, but I refuse to buy the “they're too expensive, we don't have the money” “they don't want to come to Juve because of lack of CL” and the “Vucinic is also a champion” theories.

I don't have a problem with any of the signings. I think Marotta is more than capable to give Conte a competitive team. I just think his dealings with the press need to be more subtle.

the mercato, meaning only the players brought in, the sums spent for

1)Ended up being woken at 8am by my bro who says SURPRISE! get your ass up, the bus to Raleigh is leaving at 11 so we can go watch the game=D
2) American fans really don't know how to treat professional athletes. Spam-yelling their names on the top of their lungs asking them for their jerseys isn't going to make them happy you know. Athletes are human beings too, so they too get agitated, pissed off, and fed up with things/people. And the guy(s) chanting ESTADOS UNIDOS all the time got on my nerves…

3)Pepe actually kept really good width throughout the game, always giving Quags (who had a marvelous game) an out-ball, which caused that very good chance where Pepe was too selfish and hit the side netting. Pasquato looked to come inside more, but was a little quiet.
4) It was FLIPPIN AWESOME being less than 10yrds away from the subs (when they were warming up) and ADP when he came to sign shirts (sadly I didn't manage to get mine signed)

5) The crowd was really nice to Pirlo and really got behind him when he came on… Maybe that's why he was the only one (besides ADP) to sign a few shirts… Krasic and him left a lil earlier and Milos was like f it I'm outta here while Andrea stayed to sign a few shirts (again, I failed to get mine signed)
6) ADP had his own specialized post-game cooling-down seperate from the rest of team… Why?

7) Some chick thought Giandonato was hot, while I think that Matri looks even more wicked IRL. Pepe and Quags look really short IRL
8) When the subs where warming up, Licht was constantly discussing tactics with Freddy, PDC, and especially Giandonato. Seems like he's settled in very well.

9) Durham is a fucking ghosttown around and after midnight. Ooh and if anyone saw 2 negros wearing a pink and black striped ADP shirt and a Juve home shirt (me), then that was my bro and I.
10) My personal highlight of the game (related to #8 and#2): Licht is doing his thing, discussing stuff with Manuel, and some muppets start spam-yelling his name 10times. So he turns around, gives them all a mad “WTF DO YOU WANT” look with his arms spread wide to make him like angrier, and goes back to what he was doing. A few moments later, them muppets finally shut their trap and stopped harassing him. Wise decision.

Trouble is, we have 4 1st team midfielders (Vidal, Pirlo, Pazienza, Marchisio) and max of 2 subs (Ekdal and Giandonato unless they're loaned)….that makes it 6 players for a possible 5 positions for a whole season….

If you had to get into the depths of it, let's make a simplistic assessment on who would protect the defence/who would attack:

Pirlo – Deep lying playmaker
Vidal – Box to box (either of defend/attack)
Marchisio – Same as Vidal
Pazienza – Pure DM
Ekdal – Attack
Giandonato – Same as Marchisio (for the most part)

Note that 3 out of 6 are “engine-room” type of players, which doesn't really work well in a 442/424 where we're safer with pure DMs.

This either means that we're going to, in a twisted sort of way, expect Pirlo to get injured during the season and employ a 442 with Marchisio/Vidal….or play a 433 with a Pirlo midfield but a hybrid and unlinked attack (with quags mostly benched)


I find sound logic in this….allowing your formation and playing style to be adaptable to two distinct identities based on injuries, opposition and match situation. However, this might mean that we don't give enough playing time to either the extended midfield or Quags.

However, we still need a quality LW to ensure we can play either formations ! And Vucinic is not it.",vidder911 ,"Jul 29, 2011 ", 9:31 PM,

Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"I am sure many of you recall last year, around this time, when we were all so fucking dismayed at the new restrictions on non-eu players. Taking it down to 1 ruined our plans to grab both DZeko and Krasic, and in the end we spunked our load on the serb, then saw Edin trundle of to Man City in the January window and into a far from seamless transition from German to English football.

The apparent aims and horrible consequences of the restrictions are separate matters. Closer to home is the change in the ruling this summer mercato, allowing not one, but now two non-eu signings from outside of Italy, per club.

Unlike last summer, we do not seem to be in the same frenzy, but surely, with the copa america just passed, and sporadic rumours popping up over the last few months, the club likely do have their eyes on the two to fill the spot. So who are they?

Vucinic? The inconsistent, but versatile and on occasion highly skilled Montenegrin seems to be the one target of real substance. Much to the chagrin of many juventini. non-eu, but already registered in Italy, so he can't take the second spot.

Bastos? Has he received his EU passport yet?

But who else???

I have just remembered Vidal…so in fact, we have the one spot remaining, and I ask, who will take it…and also, Vucinic and/or Vargas, wouldn't take up a spot as they have both already been registered in Italy…

Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"Conte has everything to do with it. I am sure Marotta is not going to go and spend 15-18m of the budget on a bench player. Also both Marotta and Conte really know what is going on in the dressing room, something we don't. If Marotta and Conte get rid of Melo because of attitude problems then we have to trust them that the problems are beyond the point of fixing. If Conte is going to bench Sissoko every game then we might as well have 7m in our pockets. So if Vucinic succeeds then kudos to Marotta and Conte and if he doesn't then blame both Marotta and Conte.

Vucinic is no Rossi but he will fit Conte's system better then he is a good buy: Conte believes so, Marotta believes so, and even Moggi agrees (quite remarkable for a man who has criticized Juve's transfer campaign until 2 weeks ago).

Right now we have ADP, Iaquinta, Amauri, Matri, Quagliarella Toni, and maybe even Martinez. From that list I only see ADP and Matri guaranteed to be at Juve next season. Iaquinta and Amauri are on their way out. Quags and Toni will probably stay with us. Martinez can be included in any deal with make, he is easily disposable. So, if we keep ADP, Matri, Toni, and Quags an extra reinforcement can't hurt the team. He is not a champion and not the second coming of Maradona but can anyone here honestly believe that he can't help the team if Matri or Quags get injured?.

Vucinic also brings something to the table that we didn't have previously, he gives the team versatility. He can play as a seconda punta or prima punta in a 4-4-2, he can play wide in a 4-3-3 and if it is a must win game, he can play as a winger in an ultra offensive 4-2-4. I think Conte will do what Mourinho did when he was loosing. He will keep all his strikers and bring in an extra forward for a midfielder. When Ranieri and Delneri were our coaches we complained that when we were tied, the coach will opt to bring in Sissoko for Aquilani, and then we would loose the game. This year if we are tying a game expect Conte to bring out a midfielder and bring in a forward. Vucinic fills that need.

The other thing he brings to the team is competition. Quagliarella and Matri are not guaranteed starting spots, they have to work for it. The one that fits the coach's ideas better is the one who plays. The one who listens to the coach the most is who plays. We will probably see that in midfield with Pirlo, Vidal, and Marchisio fighting for a starting spot, 2 of the 3 are going to get that in a 4-4-2.

The purchase was not a masterstroke, but it is not comparable to what Secco did. Can anyone say the team this year is not better than last year?. Can anyone say that the team is half built like it was when Ferrara coached?. Take a breather and lets see what happens once the show starts at the end of August.",JoseR ,"Jul 30, 2011 ", 1:43 PM,
Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"Random thoughts:

To Vucinic or not to Vucinic?
When we were linked with Sanchez, Aguero and Rossi, I felt a bid odd because imo they didn't actually the same type of players.

Aguero and Rossi are a bit similar; they thrive on the break using their speed and skills but they are not playmaking seconda punta. They are however, very good goal scorers. Occasionally when their team stutter, they come up with gold. But more often than not, when you kill the source of the creativity from midfield, they also suffer.

Sanchez was a playmaking seconda punta when he run riot in the second half of last season. He roamed everywhere from midfield to the final third; from center to both wings. And his skills, power, and workrate allow him to do that. He's not as prolific as Aguero and Rossi, but he gives so much more elsewhere. Is he a difference maker? You bet.

Vucinic, our newest team member, is imo closer to Sanchez than Aguero or Rossi. His strength is his skills and versatility. He'd do well at every position in the final third. He is, however, a bit inconsistent and lazy. He's like a lite-Sanchez; a Sanchez without his power and workrate.

To me, Sanchez or Vucinic's type suit us better compared to Aguero's or Rossi's. Time will tell if Vucinic will succeed or be closer to Juan Esnaider.

Does it mean Rossi won't come now that Vucinic is ours?
Without a doubt: No, Rossi won't come. It doesn't make sense to get both Vucinic and Rossi since they occupy the same position: seconda punta.

If the table is turned, would the team really be better with Rossi rather than with Vucinic?
Strictly on the offensive line: It doesn't depend on them. It depends on whether we can get a quality (and real) LW.

So what happen now with Quagliarella?
I'd say Quagliarella is similar to Vucinic. Quags is more powerful and very good in changing direction and pace. He also works harder. Vucinic is more skilful and versatile. Vucinic is the “yin” (ice) and Quags is the “yang” (fire). I guess they can co-exist and whoever starts will depend on the opposition, and Quag's knee.

So in the end, is the team better with the addition of Vucinic?
Yes, but the real question is: Is it significant? I'd say no. The most significant/impactful additions, now that we've got a RB and LB, will be the CB and LW. If the CB and LW are golden, we're game. If they're not, we'd be like a one-wing bird: we're flying but not straight and definitely won't reach the destination.


Just my 2cents.",dwicarta ,"Jul 30, 2011 ", 2:34 PM,
Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"I am slightly frustrated right now. No, not because of the (highly probable) signing of Vucinic. Yes, that rumor made me scratch my head. Yes, that signing will look like we are settling for the next best thing to Rossi, who were the next best thing to Aguero. Yes, maybe Vucinic's not a world class forward, nor a “champion” (I'll get to that word soon enough).

First, remember Fabio Quagliarella, whom we signed because Di Natale said no? Remember Alessandro Matri, whom we signed because the almighty Floro Flores said no (granted, he said no because we, the fans, practically vetoed that transfer)? I'm not saying Vucinic will be a guaranteed success. I'm just hoping we could stop saying “Marotta you dumbass” or “I now pronounce thee JuveDoria” before we see how Conte actually plans to play him. People seem to forget that DS works together with the coach. Remember how Deschamps resigned because he didn't think he could work with Secco (and Blanc)?

THE MOST ANNOYING THING is when people start to compare Marotta to Secco. REALLY, PEOPLE? REALLY? THAT Secco??

For me, this mercato has been quite positive. We got 1 great player (Pir-fucking-lo), although I admit I'm not sure how he'd fit in. We got 1 good squad player in Ziegler, whose name if I remember correctly, have been mentioned quite a few times last season when Grosso weren't tanned. We got one decent backup player who sacrificed CL to play with us in Pazienza. ALL 3 FOR FUCKING ZERO MILLION EURO!

Next, we got Lichtsteiner by paying 10 mil, and Vidal for a similar amount. Now, whoever thinks these 2 aren't good signings, I would suggest you become a Citizen. Sheikh would welcome you with open arms. Perhaps you can help them teach a thing or two about bibs to racist victims.

So I'm having a bit of a trouble understanding why so many of us seemed unhappy. We signed 5 players, with more positive than negative. Oh, I should also mention we confirmed the permanent signings of Quags (positive), Matri (positive), Pepe (we need him, IMO, so: positive), and Motta (negative beyond believe, but cheap as fuck). Yes, we let go of Melo. Yes, we didn't sign Aquaman (yet, if rumors are to be considered). But again, as I said, more positive than negative.

So maybe we're cursing Marotta for not signing a left midfielder, or left LW? But this doesn't make sense… We HAVEN'T signed a LM/LW yet, yes, but the market is still open for one more month. When did last year's signing of the season (Ibra to Milan, not the overrated Robinho to Milan) take place, anyone care to remind me?

Or maybe we're cursing Marotta for promising us champions yet failing to deliver on that? Coz I would have sworn that a lot of us didn't really believe him when he said that? I mean, forget about the word “champions” for a moment, coz the jury's still out on that word's definition, and only Marotta and God know what he meant when he said that particular word. Can we please just focus on the actual transfers rather than the promises? Or are some of you still holding your breath waiting for Galliani to reveal this Mr.X? Or, or or!! Would you like us to sign Ribery for 70 million Euro and 10 mil a season net salary? Coz you bet Bayern would let him go for that money! And surely he's a “champion”?!?!

OK, I'm very frustrated, not slightly. My bad. Point is, I love this blog. I love the people here. That's why I'm feeling this way right now. When things that I care about stop to make sense, I become agitated.

Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"No need to be frustrated, at all; most of us have not lost our minds, we've actually applauded most of the transfers so far. The issue has 2 subtexts, which we all discussed before.

1) Juventus and the so-called provincialism. While I do not think Agnelli is a provincial by any definition, Marotta's apparent thinking patterns and actions do suggest a different paradigm than the one Juventus has developed over the years. Not “JuveDoria” perhaps, but not Juventus as we know it, either. When I said earlier that I don't buy the “we couldn't do any better given the circumstances” style arguments because they are too defeatist, this was what I had in mind.

The argument to give Marotta time to build-up is also very stale by now. This is his second transfer season, and at this level, people do not get any more chances without delivering something on a major scale; I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way it is. So, are the transfers so far good? Sure, Pirlo is of course a great (but his actual performance remains to be seen given age/injury situations), Licht looks very good to me, Vidal I haven't seen but everyone says is “v. good”, and Vucinic, well, he can be very good, and he can be completely absent. This is not a stellar marketplace performance, but not a disaster, either, provided we do get a good LW.

2) Connected to the first one; when a director of Juve says something, he is to be taken seriously (whether we actually “believe” him or not is irrelevant; so yes, few of us actually believed him perhaps, but it doesn't matter. When the President of the U.S. says he's thinking of declaring war on some country, you don't shrug your shoulders in cynical disbelief, even if it never materializes; you might do that when the leader of, say, the Maldives makes that statement) at all times, simply because he is Juve's director. A provincial team's admins can make announcements to keep their fans busy, to get media attention, to bolster their egos, to undermine similar provincial opponents, to drive up the prices of one of their players, etc etc.

That stuff is all small-time play, it is not what Juve does. This is why when Juve announces its serious interest in a player (regardless of the caliber of the player, and how “impossible” it is in some people's minds to get him), the world takes notice and takes it seriously (or used to); this is why, when Juve declares an overall strategy, the world takes notice and begins to expect things of matching ambition (or used to). Do not give me the same old post-calciopoli talk; we are all very aware of the realities Juve faces, but this situation requires grand gestures and acts to back up the talk if we're to be taken seriously (and one's reputation, this is true for individuals as well as communities, is far more important than most people realize; it is a real, tangible capital that is earned over long periods, and lost quickly), and this is why what someone in Marotta's position does is very important, beyond the worth of his transfers.

So, you see, we're not a bunch of superficial whiners when we criticize various issues, there's a good deal of thinking behind it. Talking about this transfer and that transfer should not derail us from looking at the big picture, and how other aspects of our identity is redefined. I didn't take any offense at what you've said, I think most of it is quite valid.",juvealways ,"Jul 30, 2011 ", 4:29 PM,
Mercato Analysis: Falling Dominoes,johncas,"Jul 28, 2011, 9:12am PDT",,"When the mercato started, Marotta said the following – “Last season we added quantity, this year we will bring in 2-3 players of absolute quality”

We had four clear failings last season -> Fullbacks, a central defender who is a leader, and a left winger

Let us see what he has done ->
1)Pirlo – Great player, but how does he fit in Conte's formation?
2)Pazienza – backup.
3)Ziegler – Definitely not a world class LB. Decent at best. If PDC is starting i dont have any problems.
4)Lichtsteiner – good buy, solid player. But he is no Maicon.
5) Vidal – New to serie A, but all indications are that he is damn good. But, again, new to serie A. So jury is still out.
6) Vucinic – Where doe he fit in? Is he our LW? our SP? What about quags? One of the most erratic, temperamental players in Serie A, and even then he is not world class by any stretch of imagination.
7) Sold Melo – the guy who was our most consistent player last year.
8) Pepe – for 10m total cost. Could have rather given this money to charity.
9) Quags – overpaid, for a striker coming back from serious injury.
10) Motta – really? when every cent is important and people are bitching about not having funds?
11) Sissoko – great move
12) Matri – Good player, but 17m?

Now tell me, for a team that finished 7th last season (SEVENTH) is this what we need? This constant chopping and changing and settling for lesser targets is not how winning teams are made.

Let me tell you a secret. No team, none, has ever won a league without at least one player of absolute quality and class. Great teams are built around great players. And currently we dont have anybody.

Winning in football requires a lot of sacrifices. On the pitch, off the pitch, and even on the balance books. That is why its a passion, and not a business venture.

Its a great article, keeping the generally high level of quality writing of all Somnath's pieces I have had the pleasure of reading. My only minor gripe is the reference to Martinez as a winger, when our ploy of playing him as a winger last season was one of the major reasons for his abject failure. His best periods have definitely been as a left wing forward, rather than hugging the touchline and putting crosses into the box, instead, cutting into the box with flair and a wicked turn of pace, then having a pop at goal himself.

Also…presently, I assume that Pepe is the back up to BOTH the left and right offensive flank positions. And if Conte is a decent manager, he will want two players for every position. As Pepe is naturally right footed, although Conte likes inverted wingers, Krasic will more likely still play on the right, and it makes sense for Pepe to be the reserve for Krasic, not whoever we bring in for the left wing. Somnath is spot-on to suggest that we lack left wing options. Still…I am aware of Vucinic;s impending arrival, which could leave us with Pasquato as his reserve and Pepe as Krasic's reserve.",thegutterpoet ,"Jul 31, 2011 ", 6:47 AM,

So…I retain my hope that he is working on a 'top player' signing right now, and will keep doing so until all options are OUT. Aguero we tried for, but its ridiculous to assume we can compete with double the wage, a stronger squad, a stronger league and the allure of champions league football. Rossi would have been cool, but I can understand why villareal don't want to sell more than one of the star players, without having suitable replacements lined up.

Using price to measure the quality of a player is wrong. For instance, Vidal is considered by many to be one of the brightest sparks in europe, yet we got him for 10.5 (plus bonus payments). Does it make him less of a player because we paid a very reasonable price for him??? Not in the slightest. He had one year left on his contract, and wanted to step up this summer to a better club.

Dopo aver piazzato il colpo in attacco con l'acquisto, quasi definito, di Mirko Vucinic, la Juventus continuerà il proprio mercato in entrata con l'ingaggio di un esterno di centrocampo che possa integrarsi alla perfezione nel 4-2-4 di Antonio Conte. Secondo quanto riportato dal “Corriere dello Sport/Stadio”, il tecnico bianconero incontrerà a breve Marotta per definire al meglio le strategie di mercato da attuare per acquistare l'esterno di centrocampo, che nelle idee del tecnico bianconero dovrebbe essere Diego Perotti, 23 enne argentino del Siviglia. E' lui, più di Vargas, il giocatore desiderato dal tecnico bianconero. Nelle prossime settimane vedremo se Marotta riuscirà a portare il giocatore a Torino, accontentando così il suo allenatore.

Pasquato must stay. Brace yourself, but he could actually even start on the left side of a 4-2-4, presuming we don't sign an additional LWinger. If it's between him and Martinez, he will definitely be able to compete for the spot. I loved his exuberance in our tour of the US and want to see him flourish with us for the next decade or so.

- has had lots of intensity. I don't know what Conte did, or is it simply that they are not jet lagged anymore (hard to believe) but we are at least trying.
- with that being said we were having a hard time stringing passes together. It may be because of the crazy wind that is making the ball do things that no one expects but America has had a better handle of the ball.
- interesting to see Gigi always pass short to the defense. I think Conte's instruction was to always do that off a goal kick.
- more interesting to see how fast we are passing the ball. Maybe Conte asked them to have at most two or three touches before passing the ball. That may be a contributing factor to the lack of accuracy when passing.
- it seems like the only players allowed to take on the opposing team are the wings and forwards. Pasquato did that and got us a free-kick and Krasic has been doing that as well.
- Matri almost scored a wonder goal

see that whenever Krasic found himself surrounded by opposition players, Lichsteiner
soon enough appeared to offer the option of a pass. Very encouraging showing.
7.5/10.

Bonucci-
After all I have read of the lack of confidence many Juventini
have for the youngster, I was happy to see him perform well. Made no major
mistakes, read the game well, already starting to look like a far better player
than last season, due to the emergence of two decent fullbacks. Far from
polished, but competent. 6/10.

Chiellini-
The bit is back between his teeth. A few very well timed
challenges, strong in the aerial battlefield, played the ball simply rather
than hoofed it. A clean sheet for him, Bonucci and Buffon, so well done,
Giorgio. 6/10.

De Ceglie-
Held position well, but strangely did not attack as much as
he is normally wanton to do so. Physically he appears fully recovered from his
lengthy injury lay off last season, and eager to pick up where he left off.
Satisfactory. 6.5/10.

Pirlo-
Marchisio roamed the width of the field leaving Pirlo often
forced to hold deep. On the ball he was suitably tidy, whilst far from
impressive. More to come, I hope, from the aging superstar. And I am greatly
looking forward to seeing Vidal alongside him, instead of the often ineffective
Marchisio. 5.5/10

Marchiso-
Typically disappointing. Seemed to try hard to get involved,
made a couple of decent challenges, passing was fine, but as always, failed to
truly impose himself on the midfield area, and when playing alongside a less
physically robust player like Pirlo, its imperative to impose himself, make the
opposition know that its never just Pirlo to move through, but also his warrior
partner and guardian. 4.5/10

Krasic-
Definitely looking fitter and faster than at the tail end of
last season. Put a few good balls into the box, and enjoyed the sterling
support of Lichsteiner. If we can get the left flank as fluid as the right, he
will enjoy a decent season.6/10

Pasquato-
I was so pleased to see him get the chance to impress, and
impress he did. Great on the ball, quick feet, useful passing and an eye for
goal that saw him grab the winner with a well taken first time hit. If we can
sign a more established left winger/left wing forward, I would love to see him
progress as our reserve/apprentice for that position. 7.5/10.

Matri-
Subdued, and unable to get on the ball. A non showing by
most measures, but I have not lost faith in his abilities. Once our crossing in
sorted out, from both flanks, and Vidal is in the team to offer a shield to
Pirlo as well as his own forward thrusts through the middle, he will get
chances galore to score. 5.5/10

DP-
Huffed and puffed, got involved, but failed to create any
clear cut chances. Its simply lovely to see him still able to compete at a high
level at his ripe old age. 6/10.

SUBS
Immobile-
The first awful decision I have seen by Conte was to deploy
an out and out prima punta, on the right wing. As expected, he failed to show
any value in that role, and was really a wasted chance for a young player with
a solid reputation in front of goal. He should have been deployed up top
instead of Toni. Had one glorious chance from a beautiful Pasquato cross, but
spooned it. 3/10

Toni-
Some touches of quality from the big man, but he is a sloth
now. And should be released or executed. 3.5/10

Quagiarella-
Didn't get enough of the ball to gain a rating. n/a

Barzagli-
The defence was instantly more porous when the mass of
substitutions was made. This was not solely down to Barzagli, who did OK, but more
due to swapping 5 players in a short amount of time, in one fell swoop
destroying the cohesion from before. Hard to rate, but…4.5/10.

Zeigler-N/a

Marrone-
Hustle and bustle as always, but little time to impress. N/a

Giandonato- N/a

Conclusion
Club America are deep into their season, so much sharper
than our players, and also, a quality side. One of the big two in Mexico. This
was a decent test, and I felt we did well. Pleasing to see so much more effort
to play the ball out of defence, starting with Buffon's short passes/throws to
the defence, then moving the ball up the field. The players were making
intelligent movements, with rarely a time seen when a Juve player was on the
ball with no options around him.

Positives-
Buffon regaining the grinta.
Pasquato looks quality.
Lichsteiner connecting very well (already) with Krasic.
De ceglie back in the team and looking capable of picking up
where he left off last season.
Krasic has regained his pace and stamina.
The team is gelling, and the long ball routine is vanishing.
Possession play is possible with these players.
we won! with a clean sheet to boot.

-ves
Marchisio still showing very little to justify a first team
place, especially when Vidal appears on the scene.
Pirlo too easily closed down before looking up to see the
killer pass.
Toni is a barely animated corpse.
Immobile is NOT a right winger.
We only won 1-0, should have scored more, and towards the
end ran the risk of conceding an equalizer…but then again, that was after the
flood of substitutions caused our play to become disjointed.
Quags was invisible in his brief outing.
Matri couldn't get on the ball.

Like Pancetta & Pasta,johncas,"Jul 26, 2011, 2:21pm PDT",,"Well, second game is in the past already with a good result for us but something bad is still hiding on the back.
I didn't watch the whole game last night but i noticed some good signs and some bad one:
1. In genrelal – LICH and MILOS were the best line in our team IMO. Lich start proving slowly he will be key addition to us this season. We all know Milos is bad in defending but attacking treat which Lich give to him and the team make him look more comfortable at all on the right side. Milos still need huge improvement of his game because with that kind of style he will be pretty predictable already – i mean running aroud defenders, running, running …he needs something more than dribble and running (Nice crosses for example.
The other good thing is may be faster moving of the ball when we are in attack phase – i don't know it's Conte achievement or better addition (second may be IMO) but that is also a good sign for me, if we improve that more and more and start moving the ball faster than now we will be the strongest opponent in ITALY this season. The last positive for me thing is PASQUATTO – i don't know why they want to ofload him season again and again but he is able to be one of the best subs for us – I like the guy in last season friendly but we offloaded him again. for me he ahs the future in COnte's attacking formation more than ever!He can score, driblling and running fast all that are good skills even for a wing but as 2-3 striker he can be very good. i personaly hope Conte to see that and keep him – the season will be very long and plenty of injuries in the pocket make prove myself right.
2. THE BAD THINGS – well. we still have plenty of work to be done to improve significantly.
The major thig for me is LEFT WINGER – Pasquatto was good but IMO we urgently need NATURAL,FAST and ATTACKING MINDED left midfielder – once we have him the CONTE system 4@2415daf856d3196afa89fc264ccf07ff:disqus 2-4 will start working nicely. I saw yesterday a very good right offensive line but i can't say the same for the left. Instead of looking for ROSSI or VUcinic (who i don't like for that kind of system) we MUST look through BASTOS,VARGAS,ELIA these 3 are the main candidates and i do believe we need one of them – I like VArgas but he is more powerful than techicly gifted but BASTOS and ELIA are more techically improved – thisk kind of wing we need to be able to run around the defenders one on one. I personaly want BASTOS or ELIA.Once we have a nice LW mark my words THIS TEAM WILL CHANGE HIS FACE TOTALLY!
The other problem which still persist is defence BONUCCI & CHIELLO still looked shaky on the back. I personally liked Leo before but for a year in our jersey who prove nothing more than acceptable addition. HERE WE MUST LOOK CAREFULLY NOW – WE NEED A VERY SMART AND TECHICALLY GIFTED CENTRAL DEFENDER TO ADD CHIELLINI.Once KAIZER has some good partner around him he will show his fully world class defending! I heard so many names but i personally prefer some young partner ala Sorenser but faster smarter and gentley passing ability to have (HARD TO FIND HIM I KNOW). I'M FAR FROM IMPRESED FROM LUGANO,COATES ETC NO THANKS IF THESE ARE THE FAVOURITES! sO, conte must rerquire for classy central defender before we reaching the ATTACK.
Finally we reach the last point in my view from yesterday – papers are throwing so many articles about ROSSI and VUCINIC here and there but i personally have my view about that point – Rossi for me isright man for us – WHY?? simply, WE DON'T HAVE THE ATTACKER LIKE HIM UNTILL NOW AND WE DIDN'T HAVE IT SO FAR – I DON'T REMEMBER HOW LONG ALREADY we didn't have attackker so FAST,TECHICAlly gifted especially on speed and so mobile at all – i think since very long time! he will change our game i'm pretty sure in that and that's why Marotta is looking for that type. but, now it's coming the real question here – isn't it 30 mln price tag too much for us right now having in mind the addition needed above? well, my answer is YES – i want Rossi but i can support BM in this deal for him. WITH THE ADDITION OF LW AND CLASSY DEFENDER WE WILL GIVE TO THE TEAM MORE DEPTH THAN PREVIOUS SEASON WHICH CAN BE CRUCIAL IN THE SEASON. If we take Rossi on the righ price plus the 2 necessary additions will be perfect but i personally think it will not happen at least one of that.By now Beppe is doing fine, doesn't matter that MELO-VIDAL changes are not convicing me enough – I don't know vidal but i really hope that he is not MELO version 2.0 because we will loose ground seriously.i have some good feelings about him but let's wait and see.

Like Pancetta & Pasta,johncas,"Jul 26, 2011, 2:21pm PDT",,"Back from watching the game. Here are my quick thoughts.

1. Thumbs up to Juventus and Club America fans at CitiField. The atmosphere was very good for a pre-season football game in the US.

2. The team needs to gel. The play was quite messy with a clear lack of continuity and rhythm, although it improved in the second half. Conte has work to do, but some of his ideas were a little clear to see – 4-4-2, spread the play around, use Pirlo to distribute the ball to the wingers.

3. De Ceglie started weak, but improved after the rain interruption. Chiellini and Bonucci both looked quite solid. While Lichtsteiner looked good, I was hoping for more overlapping runs with him and Krasic. Krasic seemed to do most of the right-wing action, with Stephan more hesitant to cross. Pirlo is going to be important to spread play, but I'm curious how he'd perform against a stronger team, where a defensive midfielder might be more important. I liked Marchisio's play, but again, a Marchisio-Pirlo partnership has yet to convince. Time for Vidal. Pasquato was good, but if it wasn't for his goal, I'd say he was average. Great goal, though. However, we need a quality left winger. Difficult to judge the strikers; both DP and Matri didn't do much, but it wasn't for lack of trying. Again, the lack of continuity of the team's play made it difficult to judge individual players.

4. The subs: what was that Barzagli howler where he let the ball go under his feet? Toni better not be Juve's second choice striker, or third-choice. Absolutely useless. Pazienza might be important for us as the only true DM in the squad (not counting Marrone). I expect to see a lot of him next season if we don't buy another DM.

5. My girlfriend thinks Matri is hot.",Rinaldo2882 ,"Jul 27, 2011 ", 4:25 AM,

His natural role is that of a second striker but can play the role of offensive winger in a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-4. His skilled with excellent individual technique, very good at dribbling and have a fairly powerful and accurate shot which allows him to be a good shooter of the freekicks.

Seems to have been written by Conte, but it is widely accepted by the critics of football. In the last year in Serie B surprised everyone by scoring 9 goals in 40 games and signing truly amazing performances.

The game last night was the first time I saw him in a full match and he really impressed me. So that's why I want Juve to keep him, even if they get a world class left winger.

Stephan Lichtsteiner: the profile

Birth date: 16 January 1984
Born in: Adligenswil (Svi)
Nationality: Swiss
Status: EU
Role: Right full-back
Former club: Lazio

Premise: for the realization of this profile there was entrusted a obviously limited games viewed. The images are taken from the game of last season against Juventus (Turin). For reasons of space, moreover, were not included in-depth biographical notes, however, it is easily available elsewhere on the web.

Lichtsteiner is an offensive right full-back who argues in defense phase but conveys the best at the repertoire when his team is in possession of the ball, thanks to his ease of running and his speed is often an attacker covering the entire lane in both attack and defense, more often coming down to the bottom. Is one of the best at doing crosses (as well as compatriot Ziegler, who Juventus also bought) for accuracy and frequency of our league.

involved. Apparently, Rummenigge relied on less conventional channels,
I’m really sorry for him and Bayern. They missed a good chance, both in
the transfer market and in their communication: silence would have been
preferable. Evidently, the past of a great champion and executive who
wore the Nerazzurri’s shirt as Rummenigge did, carries some weight and,

"NY Juventini, Time to Meet Up",johncas,"Jul 25, 2011, 7:07am PDT",,"I think you are not the only person that is wondering how is our midfield going to slot in. There are many ways I can see the team going

- If we play a high defensive line, tight team everyone presses, from Matri to Chiellini then maybe we won't suffer much defensively. In a review, I read that Conte's teams do not spread too much across the field (lengthwise) to keep pressure constant. I personally haven't seen any of his teams yet (Juve's 2 games preseason doesn't count). In a sense you can think of as a poor man Barca. If that is the case then the team has lots to learn because the last thing we did last game was press. Also, a high pressing game maybe suitable for our first team for the most part but I don't think Martinez, Toni, ADP, Iaquinta are the kind of players that can run for 90 minutes, Conte better have a good plan B if this is the case because this is a huge gamble.

- We throw out the 4-4-2 and move to a 4-3-3. Our midfield in that case will be composed of Vidal-Marchisio-Pirlo. In this case Pirlo will work better and Vidal wouldn't have to be a lone midfielder. This of course depends on who we buy next. Vucinic is flexible enough to interpret the 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 so that may be why we are looking to sign him.

- We make Pirlo a sub and we play a 4-4-2 with Marchisio and Vidal in the middle. A lot more mobile and stronger defensively than Vidal-Pirlo. Pirlo could come in only if the team switches to a 4-3-3. Vidal-Pazienza would offer even more cover. I don't think this is the option Marotta has in mind but if it works, and allows us to win, I think Conte will gladly bench Pirlo for the sake of the team.

- We play a reckless 4-4-2, all attacking football and finish 16th in the league barely missing relegation. Marotta is fired by mid October along with Conte and Juve is back to rebuilding next year.

The scary part is that at the end of the day it seems like Conte himself doesn't really know what he wants and he is using these friendlies to determine what is really needed. And whether we go for someone like Michel Bastos, or for Mirko Vucinic or for Giuseppe Rossi. All descent players, but vastly different. I personally think Juve should focus on offloading Amauri, Iaquinta and others. See how Vidal fits into the team with Marchisio, Pazienza and Pirlo and make a decision by early August.

This season can be one where we take our first step to silverware, but it can also be disastrous if we find ourselves next May, looking for a new manager and a new sporting director.",JoseR ,"Jul 25, 2011 ", 9:59 PM,

Pros:

-in his prime
-tall
-strong
-extremely cheap
-still has ideally 3-4 years of solid contribution left in him
-very experienced
-good marker
-leader
-massive set of balls
-supposedly gets called with formal 'you's' in the Uruguay locker room
-Italian passport so EU
-has won/achieved more in his career thus far than most of the current roster
-could teach Chiellini, Bonucci and Sorensen a few things

Cons:

-on the slower side
-plays pretty hard, sometimes too hard
-possibly psychotic
-although a leader, he has lost his mind, gotten sent off and screwed his teams over before various times
-fairly similar to Chiellini since he's a stopper
-not terrible with his feet but isn't the ball-playing defender we could use

I still say hell yes.

Antonio Conte has already lost his voice after a couple of trainings. Imagine the first match: insignificant for the Juventus people, essential for him. Is one of his characteristics: there is no difference between friendlies and league matches, to Conte is the same thing. There's always a great passion, this time a little more because coaching Juve has been the dream of his football life. A dream that has made real perhaps ahead of schedule, burning stages between Bari and Siena. He could have landed in Turin after the promotion already obtained in Puglia, but probably he was not ripe. This time he arrived at the end of a fantastic ride to Siena, and promotion of competition obtained off at a gallop, without any doubt.

If we had UCL or even Europa League games this season I think it would be perfect. Heck, I was hoping he could join us a couple of seasons ago. But right now we have 2 very similar defenders (Chiello and Bonucci). I don't think he is an improvement compared to Chiellini. He will surely be better than Bonucci, but I think Leo deserves another chance. And Barzagli is a different type of defender, more like a game-reader than a leg-crushing… not that he reads the game that well, but I see the benefit in having someone like him in the rooster.

What I'm trying to say is: with only serie A an Coppa Italia games this season, we should only have 3 well rounded defenders + Sorensen. If we get Lugano someone should leave, and I think that would be Bonucci. It is obvious Leo will benefit from serie A exprience, and if we can't provide it, a year or 2 loaned to a mid table team (not us!) may actually be a good idea.

I have never suggested he is a perfect sporting director, never suggested he is beyond all criticism….He has made some decent moves, some poor moves. Many people on here blame him for things that are not his fault. Its beyond ridiculous for any 'fan' to criticize him for failing to sell ANY of the players that Secco signed on hugely overinflated wages…If nobody wants amauri, or tiago, or grosso, or any of the other players Secco signed up, then blaming Beppe Marotta is the work of a fool. Motta was a risk, many people through he had potential, and out budget wasn't huge last summer. I can't fault beppe massively on that one, as many people I know, and read, thought motta had potential.

Krasic, Quag, Matri, Aquilani, Sorenson, Storari, were for me, ALL brilliant moves. Quag and Sorenson were lucky strikes, but still, they turned out to be brilliant moves. The aquilani deal, I thought was very well orchestrated. Motta? already mentioned him. Traore clearly we lacked the funds for an established LB, much hope was put onto De Ceglie, so Traore was a cheap risk. his only massive failure was Martinez. That was a much more costly, but equally failed effort to the lanzafame move…the strange thing about those moves, is that both players seem more naturally suited to a 4-3-3. if that was to be our formation, both would have made sense.

I think it was delneri who didnt want giovinco, and rather than sell him, we sent him to a team where he would get lots of games, with far less pressure, with at worst the option for them to sign half of his rights i.e. leaving the door WIDE OPEN for a future return. any player with ambitions of reaching the top is not going to stay with parma forever.

The trez move??? nobody knows exactly what happened. Did trez request to be nearer the family of his wife? Did delneri decide he was past it? nobody KNOWS for sure, other than trez, delneri and marrotta. speculate as you please.Camo was a liability of decreasing $ value….Tiago is a strange one, as I would have liked to have seen him given a chance this season, with a new manager, and better players around him. to lose him for nothing is annoying, but, how much is the TRUE financial loss on our accounts?diego was sold, then had a truly awful season in germany.

pirlo is a good signing, pazienza, as a sub is a good signing, ziegler is an OK signing, Lichsteiner is a great signing.Vidal is a phenomenal signing. The Melo move??? Understandable, although I suspect that Melo was not treated very well by the club in the lead up to his transfer.so, yes i can criticize him, but also give credit where its due. It was always going to take more than a year to start to truly sort out the horrible mess Secco created. to my mind, as a juve supporter of 17 years, Beppe is doing OK.

It was easier for Moggi…he struck lucky more quickly, and success on the field led to the club becoming one of the most attractive clubs to brilliant players in europe. this is NOT the situation Beppe came into. a falling, failing giant, with far too many mediocre players on vastly inflated wages…

In all seriousness, I have this feeling (no proof, not tested, and
probably not logical at first glance) that some people in Juventus felt
discontent looking at Moggi acting all high and mighty after l'Avvocato
died. Moggi probably acted as if Juventus relied on him, and him alone.
He probably became too powerful INSIDE Juventus. Out of Juve, he might
have had growing influence, but INSIDE, no one can control him anymore,
and he might have acted as though Juventus were his property and no one
else's.

As every good conspiracy theorist, I have to shock
people, and here's the shocker: Moratti (and some other motherf#ckers)
eventually learned of this internal discord, and with a common enemy,
struck a deal and hatched a masterplan to oust Moggi from Calcio. Yes,
I'm saying that some people from Juventus actually shook hands with
Moratti to send Juve to Serie B. Wonder why we didn't put much of a
fight? That's why. Wonder why we got TIM Italia as our sponsor after
that? That's why.

BUT! I have this feeling that Andrea Agnelli
truly is a fan of Juventus, and what happened in 2006 hurt him just like
it hurt us, if not more. He might have known about the “plan”, but he
was powerless to do anything about it. He was nobody significant, with a
voice that no one listened to. So he kept quiet, moved below the radar,
waited for the opportunity to bring the Old Lady back to her deserved
throne.

And now he's our presidente. I think what he's doing
right now is just to make people understand that we weren't as guilty as
we were made out to be. He knows that we won't get the scudetti back.
He knows that we won't get any sort of financial compensation. And he
absolutely knows that Inter merda won't be relegated (or even given any
sort of punishment). He's no idiot. He's just trying to clear La Vecchia
Signora's name, even if only a little bit. And he's trying to make Juve
lead the Serie A through a different method: by revolutionizing the
brand. By becoming the first Italian club to own a stadium. By becoming
the most supported Italian team in the planet. By doing the smallest
thing, like adding subtitles to Juve's official videos.

This is
his vision. Or Blanc's. Or Marotta's, Paratici's, Conte's, ADP's,
Sorensen's, I don't give a damn. All I know is that I'm absolutely
convinced this plan will work. We will, again, become the best in Italy.
And then, Europe. When Barca's cycle comes to an end, we will be there
to take the throne. Forza Juve!!!

quote from Lars on http://juventiknows.com/calcio…

“will be able to live with the wounds and scars of calciopoli our own way.”

Someone on the offside when I was on my holiday said something that upset me really.

He told me to get over farsopoli.. he told me that the knife I brought into the post had no place there…that this is only football…. so on…..

I could not respond to him then. And because it is the case now seeing your Post Lars I will do it here:

many many years after 2006 I felt sick, so sick that even I wanted to forget about Serie A, but how could I have done that? I didn't and I stick to my team….

The scars are there and if you ask me are not scars, are still open wounds which need to be healed but all this shameless display that we are seeing day by day it's getting me angry and angrier again.

No No No. I won't forget the mother fucker Moratti because by his farsopoli we lost our Juve and now we are trying to get back from where he hit us to the ground.

Juve29ro.com has made a calculation of about ~380 million euros loss after this farsopoli.

But the rage can not be prescribed! And it will come the time when we will be again Happy. I know it!

Because WE the Tifosi had to suffer the most, not anybody else, not even the players, the directors, US the simple tifosi we felt it and still feel it. That pain …

VOTD: Bianconeri Rap + Post Calciopoli Rant,johncas,"Jul 19, 2011, 7:46pm PDT",,"The two most troublesome positions since 2006 have been addressed; LB and RB. Lichsteiner is far more secure a signing than Ziegler, but Ziegler is no mug, and if De ceglie can regain some of the solid form he showed for a month or two last season, I am undoubtedly less worried about both fullback positions.

The Melo situation is strange. I can only assume that Conte had preconceived ideas about him, which were not altered upon meeting Felipe in the flesh..or…some members of the squad spoke out against Melo (to Conte). It has to be one of those two reasons. No team, unless they are truly desperate for cash, sells their player of the season. It seemed they were trying to sell him soon after the season ended, hence in June, when Melo found out that he was been offered for sale, he began speaking out, angry, like a hurt child. His explanation of his soon to be confirmed departure was awkward at best. Still, Vidal could be world class…Although I would prefer an out and out destroyer alongside Pirlo, which is more Melo than Vidal. Althgouh Pazienza can get stuck in quite fiercely and tidily.

We still need a starting left winger. As for Rossi, I will be happy if he appears in our colours, because our attack isn't amazing…DP will be 37 before the year is out. Iaquinta is always injured. Amauri is awful. Toni is a solid sub at best. Matri is quality, Martinez ?? So I think the offence DOES need improving.

We grab a LW/LM (vargas/bastos/perotti), Rossi…reinforce the CB area perhaps if we are to loan out sorenson, I will be very content with the mercato, and excited about the coming season.

This is copied straight from a website, so it must be true…

“Soccer” was originally called “association football” during the
formation of the Football Association in England in the 1860s. This
was to maintain a distinction from the other football game being
organized in England at the same time based on the handling codes,
whilst Association Football conformed to the dribbling codes. The
other football came to be known as “rugby” football, named after the
Rugby School in England.


Near the end of 1863, Charles Wreford-Brown, who later became a
notable official of the Football Association, was asked by some friends
at Oxford whether he cared to join them for a game of “rugger” (rugby).
He is said to have refused, preferring instead to go for a game of
“soccer” – a play on the word “association”. The name caught on.

Association Football was
better know as “assoccer” and naturally evolved into “soccer” which is
much easier to say…


Therefore, the word “soccer” has been used in the mother country
of all football-type games since at least the mid-19th century. The
word “football”, however, was more descriptive of the game (i.e.
kicking a ball with the feet!) and was the term more frequently used.
The British exported the game, so naturally the word “football” was the
name mostly used all over the world.

The
word “soccer” is more commonly used in several countries around the
world that play other forms of football. When Australians say
“football”, they mean Australian Rules football instead. The Irish
have Gaelic football. In the USA and Canada, of course, there is
Gridiron football. Rugby Union, Rugby League, Australian Rules,
Gaelic, American and Canadian football all owe their roots to
Association football.",MPC ,"Jul 21, 2011 ", 3:29 PM,

Most people follow the popular teams in the world and football follows the people… and their money.

China (1.3+ billion people; GDP per capita USD 7,500+) and USA (300+ million; 47,000+), along with India (1.2+ billion; 1,200+) and Indonesia (240+ million; 3,000+) are the heaviest populated countries in the world while SE Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippine, Singapore, Vietnam, Burma, etc) is one of the heaviest populated regions in the world. Just check these 2011's tour schedules:

- Chelsea -> Malaysia, Thailand, Scotland (Glasgow)
- MU -> USA
- Liverpool -> Malaysia, Southern China
- Arsenal -> also in Malaysia and China

- Barcelona -> USA
- Real Madrid -> Germany (Berlin) and China

- Juventus -> USA
- Milan -> Audi Cup at Munich, Supercoppa at China, and Sweden
- the merda -> Germany (Bochum), Dublin Cup at Dublin, and Supercoppa at China

All top teams follow this pattern.

Indonesia is the largest populated country in SE Asia and there's a huge base of fans here, and as Marco kindly pointed out, proven by the availability of an Indonesian version of juventus.com. Sadly, as the GDP per capita points out, Indonesia's economic condition doesn't permit the tours to happen.

And I assume the same thing also happen to India. Huge fan base, no money (No slights intended).

Malaysia, on the other hand, with only 28+ million population, has USD 8,000+ GDP per capita. That allows them to spend on EPL team's tours.",dwicarta ,"Jul 22, 2011 ", 6:17 AM,

A loan simply does not make sense. The guy just got “acclimatized” to Juve and played his best football here last season. So selling makes sense if it brings lots of money, as keeping him would also make sense despite the man-child's fragile mind.

A loan does not accomplish anything for the club, even if he goes with a good fee/full salary paid. So Marotta can host an extra brunch at the club with the proceeds, but at what real price? Melo will surely not be himself (or very kindly disposed towards Juve) once the loan is over, and we'll have to sell him for a fraction of his current market value after a year at a declining Galatasaray (which has had the worst season of its entire history last year). And if they include some ludicrously low option for GS to buy him into the deal, it will be the crowning achievement.

I'm still not a fan of Melo, but I have two eyes, and for every time I cursed him this past season, I've also seen him do something positive for the team. Let's hope this loan talk is just another exaggerated bs news. Big, big mistake otherwise.",juvealways ,"Jul 22, 2011 ", 7:38 AM,

The
world number one of bianconeri fans in the media, got back on the pages
of Tuttojuve.com and in exclusive answers to a lengthy interview on
the training camp of Bardonecchia, on the transfermarket, the prospects
of the new season of Antonio Conte and about farsopoli.



New beginning, we start from the past, Antonio Conte, first impressions.




Conte has
been without doubt the top player of the training camp bianconero. The
crowd went nuts for his candor, for his attention to detail of every
training session and, of course, for the juventinita he breathes every
corner with his return. He has history on his side and can afford to
rebuke or critical dialogue with players who otherwise would not
tolerate this situation.




Let's
talk of training camp: Diary of Bardonecchia, or Pardonecchia (so we
read on your facebook page) what you liked best and what not?




I
liked the logistics of the city that is big enough and allowed us to
work calmly and with adequate space, the cool weather but not too much
(except for the hail of mid-week). For the same reason, to be honest, it
was more warm Pinzolo enclosing hotel, restaurants and field reference
in a handkerchief and then contact with the fans was more fiery.

But here's the worst part, in my mind: Galatasaray is very unlikely to spend the 13 million at the end of the season; the typical money they spend on “big” transfers is under 10 million, and that's reserved for crowd-pleasing dribblers and play-makers, not for potentially inconsistent defensive midfielders.

Which leaves us with another player who will be returning to the club next season with less than good feelings, and a possibly frustrating season at a struggling team. How much will he be worth then?

This whole thing leaves a bad taste; we said we'd wait until the end of this transfer market to judge Marotta properly, but so far the pluses (Ziegler, Lich, Pirlo, maybe Vidal) do not truly shine, and the minuses (Melo, lack of the “big name” transfer, no left winger yet, etc) are not easily discounted.

If roma doesn't want Barza to take Bojan back, they have to pay another 28m (40m in total).

I guess another way you could look at it is as something like a loan, where roma is being paid 1m for taking Bojan for two years and not buying him (they will have to pay his salary, obviously). If roma wants to buy him after those 2 years, they have to pay 40m.

VOTD: Bianconeri Rap + Post Calciopoli Rant,johncas,"Jul 19, 2011, 7:46pm PDT",,"You have to look at the operation in its entirety. I believe Melo's cost was 24m, he signed in 2009 and his contract expires in 2014, so he was given a 5 year deal. In Juve's books the player's cost is 24m/5 = 4.8m/year of contract. Therefore, after two years he is worth (in Juve's books) 24-9.6= 14.4m. After his loan with GS expires he will be worth in our books 9.6m (same math). So, in Juve's books if we sell him next year for 14.5m (including what they pay for the loan) Juve will be making a 4.9m profit on the player. I know that is not how the fans see it, but that is how the accountants at Juve see him and Marotta has to listen to them too.

Now, lets add to that the fact that Melo was not worth 24m but probably more like 16-18 when Secco bought him, also that he had one horrible first season at Juve, two 7th place finishes in Italy in the last two years, and his world cup meltdown… well, you get the point.

Lastly, I believe if Sanchez is worth 37m, and Aguero 45m, and CR something like 100m, then Melo has to be worth at least 18m just like you do. But the problem is that the cost of a player is somewhere between what the highest bidder will pay for him and what the club will sell for. As it stands the club believes Melo's price is about 15-16m and GS believes the player is probably 12m. So therefore that is his price. If you ask me, getting 1.5m for Melo, no more drama on TV, saving on his 2.4m salary and having the potential to receive 13m in one year for him, I say it was a good piece of business, at least as good as it can be.",JoseR ,"Jul 22, 2011 ", 3:26 PM,

As much as I try to, I still can't believe there were not at least some teams willing to buy him – hell, Arsenal were allegedly chasing him not so long ago!

Galatasaray may find the money required to purchase Melo, especially given their new stadium and the projected income from it, but it will take Melo to have an epic season for this to happen (and even then, it won't be certain). Melo may certainly boost GS quality-wise, but it's far from granted that he will have a good season with them.

Also, it's really amazing how apathetic Marotta has been at negotiating the sales of those who were bought by Secco. Sometimes I think he wants to sell those players for the sake of getting rid of them; otherwise, I find it problematic to explain why almost every sale is for free or half the price originally paid.

A brief note on Vidal
Source: juventus.com

A decade later, the Chilean flag is back to wave at Juventus’ home.
Exactly ten years after the ""Matador"" Marcelo Salas, the striker bought
from Lazio and the sole representative of the South American country
until now, here comes Arturo Vidal.



Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo was born in Santiago in 1987, exactly on 22nd
May, a legendary date for the Bianconeri who clinched their record title
in 1977 and lifted the Champions League cup in 1996. He comes to Torino
following a four-year experience in Germany, in particular he was one
of the reference points at Bayer Leverkusen, which club finished the
Bundesliga at the second place last season, just behind Borussia
Dortmund.

Arturo Vidal is a complete player, capable of covering several
positions. He can be used either as defender or as attacking midfielder,
but the position which highlighted his qualities and talent was the
central midfielder. Thanks to the completeness of his experiences, he
can join quantity and quality, perfectly covering during the defensive
step and shooting when moves forward, as shown by the ten goals scored
in the last Bundesliga.",dwicarta ,"Jul 22, 2011 ", 4:59 PM,

Firstly, the 4.5m for a year's loan + full wages is a HUGE amount for any club. Now assuming it's a 'non-forced' buy, then GS will essentially pay 7mn for a midfielder (for a year) they don't own…they're not THAT stupid. Alternately if he does well and they do want to exercise the option themselves, they still have to negotiate a wage contract with Melo which will be at least more than 2.4mn. If they don't come to an agreement then Melo will be shipped back after having earned 7 mn for Juve.

If the option is a 'forced-to-buy' one, then GS is simply looking at paying the money in 'installments' which has become a common feature among unsettled big-players transfers (Ibra to Milan, Boriello to Roma and Matri to Juve). Now you might ask why a loan instead of a straight purchase? Seems to me that this is where they take the player's wish into consideration, by promising to take him back a year later if he doesn't feel good at his new club. This way they are not forcing him out once and for all, they're cajoling him to quit while respecting his choice…

Usually, there's also a penalty clause inserted into forced options… Incase GS doesn't want to buy him next year, Melo returns after earning 7mn+ penalty payment for Juve…. financially a killer deal.",vidder911 ,"Jul 22, 2011 ", 6:27 PM,

Juve are ready to face the first real test of the season. After Sgambati and related goleada against Representative Val Susa and the Lucento, now things get serious.

We will try to bring already in the field the progress for which we are working. ""


Definitely against the Portuguese will not change the module, or attitude:

""The module is relative, are just numbers – says the coach – but much depends on the interpretation. It is basically a 4-4-2, then if the wingers play a little 'more forward or backward, does not change anything. ""

I was a big fan of him when he was at Palermo, and he was more than decent for too long to have by now lost all that talent. As for Bonucci…He has only had 2 seasons in the top flight, and was definitely not one of our worst players last season. He suffered often, as did Chiellini, from the fullback problems. With big Giorgio often playing as two positions, CB + LB, Bonucci had more work to do in the middle than he should have to contend with this season. Add in the ridiculous amount of games that Motta was given, all of which meant that Bonucci had to mirror Chiellini and play CB + RB, and then…also in his defence and support; Prandelli continues to select him.

I would be happier still, if we kept Sorenson as our 4th choice centreback, and also as a makeshift RCB. Get rid of Motta and Grygera.

The ideal is surely two players for each position. Challenging each other for the starting spot, the one lagging behind always eager to get a chance and grab it with zeal and determination, make it his own. I believe that Conte will enforce such a meritocracy. I was appalled at the way Delneri operated with the Buffon/Storari situation. Buffon was given the starting spot as soon as he was back into full training, long before he was match sharp. What kind of message does that send to the players challenging the starters??? It tells them that no matter how they do when they get a chance, its never going to be their position. A disincentive to drive on like a true warrior.

So…

Buffon/ Storari (although I think he will be sold, though hope he isn't)/ Manninger

Lichsteiner/ Grygera? Bonucci/Barzagli Chiellini/Sorenson Ziegler/De Ceglie

Krasic/ Pepe Pirlo/? Vidal/Pazienza Marchisio/?

Matri/ Toni Rossi/Quag/DP

I am assuming that Iaquinta, Amauri, Martinez, Sissoko, grosso and motta will all be culled.

The great thing about Vidal is that he could likely take Pirlo's spot, with Pazienza or Marchisio next to him. With a fully fit squad, and if we purchase a left winger of true quality, I am unsure where Marchisio fits in.

I am eager to see a Matri pairing with Quagiarella, as I am eager to see Pirlo alongside Vidal in the middle. Bonucci paired with Chiellini has potential, in my eyes and mind, despite what many say about their lack of chemistry. That partnership simply cannot be judged on last season…as we played without any fullbacks!

Random thoughts about your post:

-For 10 million, Sevilla will put Perotti in a neat little box, cover the latter with some colorful paper, wrap a big red bow around it and put him on the first flight to Caselle.-Coates is a stud and should be available for ~7 million + bonus max imo.
-I don't see the above two players combined costing more than 20 million max.
-Vargas at 15 million would not be too great of a deal if you ask me, especially seeing as how he doesn't fit the LW profile Conte is rumored to be looking for.
-Between Vargas for 13-15 and Bastos for 13-15, I'm going with the Brazilian. Any day.
Since we are talking Copa America players, here's a crazy idea:

Oswaldo Vizcarrondo. Had a fantastic Copa America, strong, tall, a force to be reckoned with in the air, a defensive leader for Venezuela, looked very good at set pieces on both sides, tackled and defended cleanly, internationally experienced. Would probably cost a couple of million at most.

Cons: No EU passport, although already 27, he has never played in Europe.

How about we fill one of the non EU spots with him, strengthen our defense and still have nearly the same budget as before to spend on a LW?",jorid22 ,"Jul 23, 2011 ", 3:27 PM,

Cons: No EU passport, we'd have no EU spots left once purchasing him, although already 27, he has never played in Europe, short, international tournaments can often be deceiving and make even the most average players seem hidden gems (El-Hadji Diouf, Ilhan Mansiz docet).

I love Lugano as a player and for 3-4 million (assuming Fener would let him go for that much), he'd be a very solid pickup. He is pretty similar to Chiellini in his style of play, although he is a defensive leader with tons of experience.

As for assuming Conte prefers an inverted winger, I have no idea who would be the best option. From the few LW's we have been linked with, I still say 13 million for Bastos is a good deal.

you can think that we want… but i don't…

the problem last year wasn't at all the central defenders but the lack of balance of the team and of course the lack of coverage on the sides and in front of defense….

take a look on the transfers done until today… and we will understand what i am saying…

the squad if you ask me is 90% ready to do a great season.. if the top player (which in fact had to be 2-3 ) will arrive it's fine by me… but Juve is doing ok … 90% ok… only a strong left winger and i say we are done…

i really appreciate Peppito but i don't know if he is really useful at this point… maybe he will be and i don't get it…

what i don't get?

well it's easy.. we have ADP, Toni, Fabio, Mattaattaaatri and we would get Peppito or whoever as a Striker, right? well who will do bench ? not Matri … but why Fabio who just returned from injury and being so well this days… adp? why cause he is 37? last season we drove this team …. Toni? he is also useful when the game needs him , or his type of Striker…

The second part of that sentence also goes for Toni. So we need something extra to be able to cope with injuries AND of course simply because Rossi is a game-changing player… Only one player really out of form and we would be in shit without him.

you have done an overview…

we are still talking about only 2 places in 4-2-4 or 4-4-2 formation.

another very anoying thing is that although everybody says that this year we are taking quality it seems that we are taking quantity also seeing number of new players in the team.

until now there are 4 in the starting 11. 4 and we still need a left winger.

so if you ask me , we don't need really to spend like crazy to show everybody that we can…

we can buy a lfet wing because we badly need it, and that's it… we wait….

if the market, if the pre-season games, the caoch asks and can be done.. yes we will take somebody else but.. i wonder why should we buy only because we have the money to that??

I don't know how you think about it but adding quality does not eliminate the possibility of adding quantity and the other way around. So far I'm happy with the work Marotta has done but we need at least 2 more players: a LW and a SP.

I'd take a striker for the reasons I already explained. What if Matri gets injured ? Alé and Toni are not supposed to be starters anymore imho… They are way too static. Every team fighting for the scudetto has more than 2 great attackers, 'though it can vary depending on the system and number of attackers in the line-up.

We probably disagree in the Del Piero department, but from what I've seen he was surely unable to replace Quagliarella.

- Conte was precisely hired to change that type of mentality. I expected a little more determination since that is all they have been talking about since hiring Conte.
- Our defense still sucks, that can be because they need to learn the coach's schemes. Leaving a player all by himself like the first goal was stupid, someone has to take the blame and I hope Conte cracks the whip

Had you watched him regularly in the last 5 years I suspect your opinion would be different. The man is a beast, and has one of the best slide tackles in the game as a whole. His determination is wonderful, and he enjoys popping up with the odd goal or three, not just with his head, but with his feet as well.

The whole team will change when Vidal enters the fray. The difference between Pazienza/Pirlo and Vidal/Pirlo is immense. I can't wait to see arturo in action!

Also…competition for places has improved. Players do not want to get injured, and lose their chance at owning a starting spot. We played shit, and yet lost only 1-2. Its not the end of the world, and really tells us little, other than we have a lot of work to do.

-City had supposedly offered 45 million Euros and the player was expected to sign in a matter of days. But City has yet to resolve the Tevez situation which is still up in the air.

-Aguero reportedly didn't show up to Atletico's pre-season training, yet Atleti put him on their Champions League squad list. If Atleti and Aguero had both struck deals with Man City, why would Aguero not show up to training for a few days as usual and then by the end of the week when his move to City is confirmed move on? If Atleti had reached an agreement with City already, why even bother including the player on the list? Maybe City have reached an agreement with Atleti but Aguero doesn't like the idea so he decided to stay in Argentina?

Funny stuff. This is what I think:

-Aguero would have ideally liked to play for Real MADrid and stay in Spain. Since this is pretty much impossible, he'll most likely be a City player by the end of the week. They are rich and careless enough to spend 45 million on him while still not having found a new destination for Tevez.

-The whole Aguero not showing up to training (non)controversy is probably him getting some additional rest after the Copa America, while Atleti putting him in the Champions League squad list is probably them playing games/standing their ground.",jorid22 ,"Jul 24, 2011 ", 4:38 PM,

(a) The awful attendance was down to the ticket prices. Nothing else. At over 100$ a pop it's not surprising many people didn't turn up for this match.
(b) Juventus were piss poor; and pre-season had nothing to do with it. You have to remember Sporting are in pre-season too and looked like Barcelona playing Chievo at times.
© Brining in Rossi, Aguero, or whomever will not be doing anything to fix this team.

Further observations: Marchisio was awful playing on the left flank, and shouldn't be played there again; I'm not sure why we don't actually go out and buy a real LW or LM player. Although Pirlo is a breath of fresh air in our mid and his vision is second to none; he is too predictable at times. Martinez in place of Krasic seemed slow and confused at times; the fact that this player is still on this team is disappointing to say the least; unfortunately he isn't our biggest problem.

What the Hell is a player like Luca Toni even in Serie A for, let alone playing for a historic Juventus side. What a horrible barrel; he's an utter mess and shouldn't play another minute for Juventus; We'd do good to simply release him from his contract.

Two more observations; we are desperately in need of a player who can actually link the midfield and the attack; Giovinco immediately comes to mind as someone who is a glaring omission from this squad. We've heard it before; but it cannot be said enough; what the hell is Juventus management thinking when it comes to this player; they should be throwing money and playing time at him instead of entangling themselves with overrated argentinian players. Further, bringing in a player like Rossi will simply add a type of player we already have in abundance.

In fact, I think bringing a super star is sort of a populist move by Marotta/Agnelli. This team lacks pedigree in terms of superstars, and by bringing a recognized player they may be trying to improve the brand and possible sell more tickets.

Regarding the game, it was a piece of crap, that's it. I am not sure if any one single player can really connect the lines – in my view, the modern game requires a lot of movement, a sort of total football. I would prefer to see this team to attack as a team and defend as a team. Long balls and rigid tactics do not work, at least at the level we should strive to be.

That said, a player like Giovinco could have helped. Now he is not within our reach, we should probably go for a player like Hazard instead of splashing cash on Rossi or Aguero.

16:50 hours. I power the TV, a can of Coca-Cola and sit on the sofa. Juve's first seasonal: DO NOT MISS IT!!!

15:00 on the following Sunday (yesterday, note): other way out of Juventus. Another occasion to open a new can of Coca-Cola. For the first time the man expected has not played, at least for me. When he began in Bari I enjoyed seeing the special RaiTre. Now I can enjoy it after seeing about 300 matches with Juventus. I had missed the first two years on grounds of non-existence-of-pay-TV. I'm talking about Antonio Conte.

In this article we will try to figure out how he developed his 4-2-4 with the men available. Beyond jokes easy or easy enthusiasm to the mere result of the two matches (for the record, 12-1 and 6-1) is important to understand how the boys have assimilated the offensive ideas of the former captain of Juventus.

I also don't see the point of spending 45m on Aguero (I don't think Marotta will do that).
- I don't see the point of bringing Bastos if that is not what Conte wants (he is a descent player nonetheless in a position we actually need reinforcements but there has to be other options). Same goes for Vargas, who in all honesty would be better than the Brazilian if we are going to give Conte someone without the characteristics he requires
- I don't see the point of exchanging Marchisio for Vucinic and having a brand new CM next year (Marotta won't do that either… fingers crossed).

So, I think 27m for Rossi is what we may pay, or 16-18 for Vucinic (no Marchisio included) or 13-15 for Bastos. That is what we are looking at.

Now, we want a player that can kick with both feet, a tricky player, one that can play on the wing and may play a seconda punta if ADP is tired or Quags injured or suspended. How about one that knows the Italian league and has succeeded in it?. How about one who has some Europe experience? How about if he is young and can develop lots more? How about if he can play on the wing, cut in and take shots just like Conte wants?.

How about Stevan Jovetic. The kid is, well, a kid. He is talented, and plays mostly on the left but can cut in, he also has a wicked shot. Yes he comes from a lengthy injury but can you honestly say he is at least not worth considering?. I think if we go to Fiorentina and slap 22m for him they would at least consider it. If not, then a 7m loan with the option to buy for 22m next year?. Now, that is a gamble i would make. If you are still wondering where I am coming from… here you go:

Marchisio-Vidal-Pirlo
Rossi-Matri-Quagliarella

Conte has to be flexible; his squad as it stands cannot and should not function as a straightforward 4-4-2 (most notably at left wing… but there isn't a really convincing alternative to Krasic down the right, either), and this mythical '4-2-4', especially with Pirlo as one of the two, will see us overrun in midfield by any team in Italy managed by someone who isn't completely rigid in their thinking.

A 4-3-3 isn't ideal for our current personnel either, but with a liberal interpretation of the various roles within it will better suit the style of play Conte wants without conceding the midfield. Pirlo sits in the hole; Vidal and Marchisio protect him and run the show, using their natural intelligence and versatility as 'complete' midfielders. Rossi and Quagliarella cut in on their left and right feet respectively, drop deep as needed, and switch positions throughout the game, causing nightmares for any Italian man-marking systems, and allowing our attacking full-backs to overlap properly… so Pirlo can then ping balls into space. Matri is the only dedicated, spearheading 'striker', but not the focus of attacks (i.e. we do not smash aimless, wasteful balls at him from our half of the pitch).

Hang onto Sissoko for the time being, and use him and Pazienza as depth players for those midfield positions, offering stamina and strength to close out games; Marchisio or Vidal can pick up the Pirlo role as deep-lying playmaker if needs must (i.e. he gets injured). I would bench Krasic (yes, seriously), and use him as a late-game substitute when his one-note attacking runs might actually do some harm. I would also retrain him to attack down the left and cut inside, drawing the full-back and allowing Ziegler/PDC to get forward. Pepe may as well be shoved in wherever as needs be, because he excels at nothing. Likewise with Martinez (though an attacking 4-3-3 will better suit him). Del Piero is a wild card on the bench. Toni is a last resort substitute for Matri, as is Iaquinta if he survives being sold.

Sell next summer: Martinez, Pepe, Sissoko, Toni, and Iaquinta, provided reasonable replacements can be found.
Buy next summer: squad players to replace the above; the world's best available central defender, if Bonucci has failed to impress; unproven but cheap starlets; and a long-term replacement for Buffon.
Forget: 4-4-2/4-2-4, being outnumbered in central midfield, conventional wingers, and a total disconnect between midfield and attack that necessitates a 37 year-old conjuring up increasingly rare moments of magic for us to actually threaten the opposition.",ShakeAppeal ,"Jul 25, 2011 ", 11:56 AM,

but without being smarter then it's the case i can say that the 4-3-3 sugested will be used in some moments of the game this is what i can say now, but…

But the 4-3-3 that you are suggesting can' play like that because you have 3 strikers with no any knowledge of covering the field in the defense situations when the ball will not be ours. In order to play a 4-3-3 you need wingers so you can not throw Krasic anyway you can see this team.

Krasic is a fix part of Juventus starting eleven.

Nevertheless i liked very much reading your ideas. I don't have to agree with them.

VOTD: Bianconeri Rap + Post Calciopoli Rant,johncas,"Jul 19, 2011, 7:46pm PDT",,"You don't need wingers to play a 4-3-3, as Mourinho has showed at various clubs, and particularly Porto and Chelsea — or at least not traditional wingers. You can play narrowly, you can use 'inverted' attackers, and most importantly, if you are better technically (which Quagliarella and Rossi will make us when compared to most Italian sides), you can dictate how the game is played in the first place.

Playing a '4-2-4' similarly leaves us with (at least) three players who have no knowledge of covering the field in the defense situations, because Krasic isn't exactly noted for his ability to track back, harry attackers, and make tackles; worse, it leaves us with just two players covering the central midfield, one of whom is the slow and not very defensive Pirlo, and the other Vidal — who when an attack breaks down may well be found standing just about anywhere on the field and out of position because of his attacking urges. Putting Marchisio in there with them (or Pazienza, or…) means there is always cover, there is always a hardworking, versatile servant plugging gaps, staying our side of the ball, available for a short pass, and matching or surpassing the opposition's numbers in midfield.

Look, Barcelona arguably have at least four starting players who don't know how to defend when they don't have the ball. But this doesn't matter because they play high up the field, dominate the midfield (overrunning it, really, by always having at least as many players there as the opposition, and better passers to boot), dominate possession, and don't have to change their shape much when they don't have the ball. Conte's 4-4-2/4-2-4, or whatever you want to call it, is outdated, inflexible, doesn't make best use of our squad (especially if we sign one of Aguero/Rossi/Vucinic, because then one of them or Quag or Matri will either have to sit on the bench or play out of position), neuters the attacking impulses of our full backs who want to overlap and run into the corners currently occupied by Krasic or our 'left winger' Marchisio, requires everyone to run more and cover more space, and loses in a midfield battle against most teams and almost every team we will face if we get into the CL next year.

4-4-2/4-2-4 will see us banging our heads against the wall of every defence we play this year, if we even manage to keep the ball for extended periods. 4-3-3 allows us to control games and possession, and allows our technical players the freedom to tug and tease at the tactically conventional teams we are going to face.",ShakeAppeal ,"Jul 25, 2011 ", 12:38 PM,

seeing that you are very much a 4-3-3 fan I can say only that this is the Barcelona module for many years and Mou although a very good coach didn't invent this module.

i know that in theory you can get your ass kicked by a 4-3-3 but also you can win championships and have a lot of success playing 4-4-2 see Lippi and Capello Juve but also Ferguson's Man Utd.

if we talk about modules then i can also tell you that Mou came up with crazy idea and also winning to our spite to play a 4-2-1-3 with a trequartista in Snejder's person and 3 strikers who on paper couldn't at all defend and the results we saw in 2010.

So my tactical-fan friend, it is not the module that wins the game or the Serie A. Conte with the players that fit into his 4-2-4 (like we all like to say it) will manage to get results for us.

It is the way you interpret it and the players that you have at your disposal.

I am confident of that but I think also that this 4-2-4 that he played everywhere (almost) he didn't had any player in the position of central midfielder as Andrea Pirlo.

If that will be fixed then the GAME CAN BEGIN!

His current value is probably about 8-10m, but Fiorentina won't sell him for that.

Now, look at the market facts:
-Who was Alexis Sanchez before January, and what is his cost now?
-Jovetic is 21, lots of room to grow
-If he sucks we loose 5-7m in case of a loan, if he skyrockets we pay 20m. Overall a lot less than most players that have amazing six months get
-Vargas would cost us at leas 15m and as I said in my post it is not what Conte wants. Krasic is already not what Conte wants, so his two wingers, the main focus of Conte's formation do not naturally play how the coach would like.

I first found this beautiful place a year or so ago and I cannot tell you how happy I am. I had been looking for a place like this for eternity and and before I found the offside, “disappointed” couldn't even describe it. I found those other Juve sites were either not english, full of shit or mostly, just intellectually inadequate (Well actually, a certain black-and-blue offside clearly shows a severe lack of intellectuals, but we're not talking about those shitty scumbags here so let's just move on).

And the one that keeps this place alight with wonderful info, chatters, debates, insults, is, along with Roberto, you. I really appreciate it. You are one of the best bloggers I've ever come across. I don't always agree with you but I always respect and enjoy your intelligent writing and I can always feel your passion through them.

Looking forward to hearing from you here and of course, at JuventiKnows.

His natural role is that of a second striker but can play the role of offensive winger in a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-4. His skilled with excellent individual technique, very good at dribbling and have a fairly powerful and accurate shot which allows him to be a good shooter of the freekicks.

Seems to have been written by Conte, but it is widely accepted by the critics of football. In the last year in Serie B surprised everyone by scoring 9 goals in 40 games and signing truly amazing performances.

With regards to all the positive comments about Agiamba, diddo. I began posting here about a year and a half ago and have witnessed the popularity of the forum expand thanks to your leadership. All the best.

I'm in Rome finishing my vacation but have been resigned to convalescing in my hotel room after coming down with a massive fever. I'm all hopped up on meds and immobile (not Ciro) so I'd thought I'd take this time to catch up with the Offside.

I've written up a little depth chart given the information I've been reading in Tuttoaport every day with my morning espresso. My ability to read Italian is far from flawless but I've been getting the gist of it. The chart is based on Tuttosport's prediction of a 4/2/4 formation with some player speculation. Like I said earlier, I'm pretty doped up and struggle with Italian so, if you disagree, politely state your point. Anyways, here's how I see it…

L'esposto presentato 14 mesi fa dalla Juventus ha permesso un approfondimento, al quale purtroppo non ha fatto seguito nessuna assunzione di responsabilità da parte degli organismi sportivi, che anzi si sono spogliati del loro ruolo politico di governo. È del tutto evidente che, a tutela dei suoi milioni di tifosi, dei suoi azionisti e dei suoi dipendenti, la Juventus debba proseguire nel doveroso accertamento dei fatti e nella ricerca della parità di trattamento.

La società ha pertanto dato mandato ai suoi legali di individuare i migliori strumenti di tutela presso la giustizia amministrativa e internazionale. Parallelamente il management e i legali stanno procedendo alla valutazione dei danni economici che tali comportamenti possano aver cagionato. Dal momento che la decisione odierna è lontana dall'aver ristabilito equità e giustizia, la Juventus intende far valere in ogni sede competente le norme internazionalmente applicabili.

ENGLISH TRANSLATION

The outcome of today’s Federal Council confirms the absolute treatment inequality in the event of similar circumstances.

The petition submitted 14 months ago by Juventus allowed for a deep examination, unfortunately not followed by any acceptance of responsibility by the sports bodies involved, who instead dismissed their political role as governance. It is understood that, in order to protect their millions of fans, as well as the shareholders and employees, Juventus must pursue the right and proper verification of facts while looking for treatment equality.

Therefore, the Club’s lawyers have been given the mandate to identify the best protection instruments in the administrative and international law. Management and lawyers are simultaneously proceeding with the assessment of the economic damages caused by such behaviours. Since today’s decision is far from providing equality and justice, Juventus want to assert all the internationally applicable rules at every relevant office.

This is exactly what I expect to see from Andrea. And this better be a full out blast, not just a lot of smoke. I want to see shit hit the fan, violently.

Those days I had the opportunity to visit Barcelona. The holiday in Barcelona was absolutely speechless. The city is fantastic.

I don't understand those kind of people, meaning the tourists at the FC Barcelona Tour Stadium who are the common tourist, if you know the type, taking pictures with everything around, getting ahead, pushing and so on, not trying to sit relaxed on a chair (as there were plenty) and feel the history of that place, trying to understand what this Stadium means and what this team means this days.

I stopped and had some reflections on the past and the present, after seeing F.C. Barcelona, as now is also on Antonio Conte and Claudio Marchisio lips and minds, and seeing that Mister is trying to use this team as a model for the future, I can say that if the concept is going to be embraced as well, we, the Juventini all over the world, will should expect of great things to follow.

Having said that, IMO he was a very good player who had a couple of extraordinary years, but that's all. He had the chance of becoming a legend, had he stayed with us and played in Serie B. He was selfish. He had no bandiera, maybe the italy national team bandiera, but even that one looks a bit dirty after the embarrassment the last world cup was. He had the skills, but I think he somehow lacked the heart, and that's something that can put you a step above of other great players.

I'm grateful for the two scudettos we won with him, and for the world cup triumph, but that's about it. I don't imagine myself telling stories to my grandchildren about Cannavaro… maybe a quick mention while talking about the 2006 world cup, but nothing compared to what I have to say about Nedved and Del Piero… I guess not everybody is meant to be legend.

Cannavaro was without any doubt one of the finest defenders, not just of his geeration, but of history…right up there with Baresi and Maldini. A truly cultured thug, unnaturally wise, and careful to hack, pinch, wink, ONLY when it wouldn't lead to a RED card…He looked worse than he needed to, when he returned to our fold, but that was down to Ciro and Secco, and the complete absence of a midfield, NOT an indication that Cannavaro had gone from hero to zero. Even Baresi in his prime would have struggled in that juve first XI…

I care nothing for what others say…for Cannavaro has brought me so much pleasure over the years, for Juve, for Italy, and he goes down in MY own records as one of the greatest centrebacks of all time.

His jumping ship in 2006 doesn't bother me, either. From the management point of view, that's when his value was the highest and his age and salary weren't actually friendly. We could go bankrupt if every star stayed back then. Also, Fabio is a Neapolitan and he always is so we can safely say that he doesn't have the same connection to Juve as Del Piero and Nedved do and to Juve, he may even not be a legend.

However, a fact is a fact and Fabio Cannavaro is a world-class defender and WC2006 was merely his coronation as one of the best in the world ever. So it's sad to see that many fans seem to only appreciate his play there. He's been a world-class defender since his Parma's day and steadily improved until he reached his peak in WC2006.

There, he took his level up to a whole new level and together with Pirlo and Buffon were the key players to Italy's defense and attack. Without any one of them, Italy wouldn't win it all. And of the three, imo he stood the tallest. That WC confirmed him as one of the best Italian defenders of all time, joining Baresi, Maldini and Nesta (and Scirea and Gentile). All legends.

And like every other legend, he's not perfect. Hell, he may even be a mercenary. But if he is, he's a good mercenary and it cannot take his accomplishments and legendary status away.",dwicarta ,"Jul 14, 2011 ", 9:58 AM,

Go read both of my posts again and think about what you just wrote.

In this post, I do not “shower moggi's JUDGEMENT OF PLAYERS' TALENT” at all, but more his trickery. Though I'm sure many will disagree, I find that his “talent” in judging players is very overrated. Like I said in my other post, he said Inter's sale of Ibra was “suicidal”, and Inter won treble the season after.

Here, however, there is very little that shows his talent in judging players, or lack thereof, and more his cleverness & trickery. If you are referring to Moggi not seeing Domaraud as an upcoming star as a “talent”, then you are mistaken, sir.

But here's the kicker: the deal has been postponed because of either one of these two possibilities:
- The medical wasn't completed successfully, or
- Branislav Ivanovic just entered the equation.

- matri, pirlo, chiellini, krasic, eta-beta, ziegler, bonucci, licht, toni (!), buffon, de silvestro(!), pazienza, sorensen




- 424 looks smooth




- we playing on a narrow field (against a dumb team, but still) i think
it was willingly set up on a small field – imagine what can be achieved
with extra space – this is the right path: start narrow, expand and
widen. conte learned well from lippi.




- coming off the goddamn offside trap as our only defensive tactic and implying cover and tilting the team axis toward ball area




- central midfield: like i said 1 enforcer 1 playmaker GREAT CONCEPT and fits 424 like a glove




- winger movement: conte clearly instructed wingers to employ different
approaches every time they had the ball. all of those who played these
positions (marchisio, pepe/krasic, de silv) have used direct shooting,
crossing, lay-offs, cut-back-passes, far-post lobs – PERFECT our wings
are now DYNAMIC, even if the roster is still not to my personal liking




DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF


- PEPE he played good here, won 2 penalties, scored one, added a goal
like a cherry on top but i still think LW is just not his thing




- barzaglie, PDC, ADP, manninger, storari, grygera




- the LW situation: pepe/marchisio ain't gonna cut it, i don't care what you think




- rossi/vidal/poli? what's going on over at midfield? too many players even assuming sissoko/martinez/ekdal are going away




- BASTOS? why is he still not wearing number 11?




WHAT I HATED




- MOTTA is useless. talent is there somewhere but the guy has zero wits. he don't think a situation out. SELL HIM




- ADP sat on the bench the whole time. not even a cameo. eta-beta came
off and then back on – adp either injured or conte prefered to set
eta-beta CF again for some other reason

Andrea Pirlo: a champion in the midst of many uncertainties


Welcoming Andrea Pirlo in this historic moment and in a team like the current Juventus is an issue, because this is the first Champion (with the appropriate proportions) in Turin in the post Farsopoli period. It would be simplistic to also do a dry list of statistics for a player who can
claim to have dressed all three shirts of the “big” Italian, to have won everything a player can win, but that, beyond Palmares, was a true symbol of Italy football for the last 10 years.


So let us quickly retrace his career. Andrea Pirlo was born in Brescia on May 19, 1979 and with the shirt of rondinelle has debuted very young in Serie A during a Reggiana-Brescia in the
1994-1995 season. Playmaker very technical, great game viewing and excellent set-pieces taker, in the 1997-98 season collects 29 appearances in A and scored 4 goals, failing, however, with his comrades to save Brescia from relegation. But his performance earned him the call of inter, who was still crying for the “penalty to Ronaldo”, but at inter he can not find space.

Indeed when you have Cauet, Ze Elias and Winter what do you do with Pirlo?
And so the next year goes on loan to Reggina newly promoted in A and plays a very good season with 28 appearances and 6 goals, giving together with his companions (Baron and Kallon above all) the salvation, unexpected early in the season, to the team from Calabria. In
the summer back goes to inter, where, however, collects only eight appearances until January 2001. This time had come Vampeta, Farinos and Brocchi.

the rest is here:
http://www.zizoufans.com/2011/…",mike ,"Jul 15, 2011 ", 3:06 PM,
A Farewell to Mixed Feelings,johncas,"Jul 13, 2011, 12:00pm PDT",,"I know this is just a friendly, but this is my view on the game (only watched the 2nd half):
- Motta looks like he's enjoying himself, looks confident. Yeah, if only you can play against this team every week, huh?
- Melo doesn't seem to realize that this is just a friendly… Can someone remind him not to kick someone in the face?
- To a more serious note, Matri looks very sharp…
- and De Silvestro is trying too hard, nearly to the point of ignoring his teammates (can't blame a young player trying to stand out).
- Marrone looks like he doesn't belong in this team, doesn't really connect with his teammates or break up play enough.
- For an attack that has Toni in it, we don't cross enough.

By looking at Adam's tweets, we played first half in a 4-3-3, second half with 4-2-4. This supports my guess that Conte is looking at those 2 formations, and a third formation in 4-4-2, as the main formations to be used this coming season.

I was also really wondering what will the difference be between 4-4-2 and 4-2-4. Looking at the friendly, I think with a 4-2-4, Conte will have 2 inverted wingers, where they will cut in while the full back provide some width, while one of the strikers drop off, nearly a 4-2-3-1. In this friendly, Matri's supposed to be the one dropping off, but it seems like he's not dropping deep enough for it to be called 4-2-3-1, and hence, the 2 inverted wingers don't cut in as often as they really should. This means that the fullbacks don't have the necessary space to run into. With Rossi or Aguero (I know Aguero is not coming, relax) playing as the seconda punta, the 4-2-4 would work better, I think. This is probably why Marotta seems to be negotiating for these players… And yes, Quag might work, too, as the sconda punta. Switching the 2 wingers would immediately change the shape from what I would call as “4-2-4” to a more traditional 4-4-2.

Basically, I think we're going to aim for flexibility between 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 4-2-4, and 4-2-3-1. This would require a lot of players who can cover many roles intelligently. The likes of Quags, Matri, Marchisio. Pepe, and also Vidal, Aguero, and Rossi.

Lastly, if anyone remembers, I mentioned that for a 4-3-3 to work, one of the central midfielder has to pop up time and again to threat the opposition's goal. Hamsik, Iniesta, and Lampard comes to mind. Based on the few videos that I've seen on this summer ritiro, IMO this role would be Marchisio's.

A Farewell to Mixed Feelings,johncas,"Jul 13, 2011, 12:00pm PDT",,"Nope, but I can give you this:

1st half, 4-2-4 with Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Sorensen, Chiellini, Grygera; Krasic, Pirlo, Pazienza, Marchisio; Matri, Quagliarella.

14'. Val Susa 1-0 Juve. Barocco. Sorensen lost his man, Barocco, during a cornerkick and he scored a header.
22'. Val Susa 1-1 Juve. Marchisio. Krasic cut from RW and made a through pass to Marchisio who entered the box from the left (A RW-LW combination).
23'. Val Susa 1-2 Juve. Matri. Pirlo dinked the ball to Marchisio who run into the box from the left and passed it Matri for an open goal (Regista-LW-PP).
'. Val Susa 1-3 Juve. Quagliarella. Krasic crossed from right-center and Marchisio volleyed (Another RW-LW combination). The GK parried it but Quags was the first to get the rebound and scored.
'. Val Susa 1-4 Juve. Sorensen. Krasic with a short corner to Pirlo. He toyed with his defender and sent a perfect cross for Sorensen to head in (Corner-regista-header combination). Too easy.
44'. Val Susa 1-5 Juve. Matri. A play in midfield broke and the ball fell to Matri, who beat his man and sent a low diagonal shot to the far post.

2nd half, 4-2-4 with Storari (Manninger 66'); Motta, Barzagli, Bonucci, Ziegler; De Silvestro, Melo, Marrone, Pepe; Matri (Quagliarella 60'), Toni.

52'. Val Susa 1-6 Juve. Toni. A midfielder made a simple pass to Matri and with a one-touch through pass he released Toni one-on-one with the GK. He just missed a carbon copy move previously and luckily he didn't miss the second one.
58'. Val Susa 1-7 Juve. Matri. Pepe cut inside from LW and beat his man, who tackled him just inside the box (I thought it was just outside but who cared…) Matri took and scored the penalty.
62'. Val Susa 1-8 Juve. De Silvestro. De Silvestro received the ball inside the box, turned, and beat his man and the GK with a low left-footed shot to the far corner.
70'. Val Susa 1-9 Juve. Toni. A corner from De Silvestro was met with a towering header from Toni. English-style goal. Simple.
82'. Val Susa 1-10 Juve. Melo. A long range shot from Melo. The GK should've had it but he, for once, made a blunder.
90'. Val Susa 1-11 Juve. Pepe. Pepe, again, was fouled inside the area. He himself took the penalty and scored.
91'. Val Susa 1-12 Juve. Pepe. A through pass from the center of the pitch (Marrone?) released Pepe one-on-one with the GK and he didn't make a mistake.

4-2-4 against a local team didn't tell us anything. Anyway, for the first 60mins, most of the goals came from organized attacks heavily involving the regista (who bossed the midfield all too easily), both wings and both strikers. After 60mins, plays broke and all goals came from scraps.

Marchisio did good not only because it was a local team but because he was playing as an ACTUAL WINGER unlike last season. Last season he was just a wide midfielder who stays deep rarely goes up stays back and defend fullback and midfield. Here he was playing inverted winger like krasic pushing up, attacking and supporting.

Diff is last season's role was more of his off the ball postioning (crowding left side of the field, always there for someone to pass the ball to) thats y he looked useless last season at the wings because he was not doing what wingers r suppose to do but he is not to be blamed for that.

This (that is if conte keeps playing him there, or just seeing if needed can he play there) time he will actually be involved in the play and he looks good (not only now but in ritiro also) we will get better view at US tour. I dont think it will stagnant his growth. Besides with the amount of support he is getting from conte and his contract issue done and dusted, this season he should be watched especially if he continues scoring.

Vidal, Bastos and Rossi. These are the three names combined with greater insistence to Juve. Three transfers that undoubtedly would reinforce the rose at the disposal of Antonio Conte, making , perhaps, a leap in quality as promised in recent weeks from Marotta.

Arturo Vidal is who advances. Having become a highlight on the international stage in the ranks of Bayer Leverkusen, in recent weeks is a sprocket Chile at Copa America, where he launched messages of love to Juve. A bet to make with my eyes closed.

That means there will be always players better than him for that position if it is top 3 squad for every position.

I believe his role is to give every player the run for their money as given his grinta if conte drops him from first XI his going to use very ounce of talent/energy to convince conte in training that he deserves a startng XI. His versatility will mean he can cover position during injuries. besides i think he has better shot then any other midfielder in the team.

I think conte is going to alternate 4-3-3 and 4-2-2-2. He will play his part and like last season for now I m putting my trust in conte that he wont play/ give role marchisio isnt suitable/ uncomfortable in.

As I said before I rather marchisio be our back up winger than pepe. Plus this will (given vidal and bastos) be the first time in senior squad there will be a player better (on papar, feild is yet to be seen) than him in every position he can play.

Also I said that unfortunately Momo, Melo from those five will be sold.

So Vidal will be the 4th for a midfield of 2 but given the multitude of places where Claudio can play …

“He's very talented. He is definitely NOT a specialist who can do only
one thing – he's a good passer, can score goals, and is decent (not
great) as a defender. Chulla is right, his game is similar to Bastian's
(although I think Bastian has better vision as a passer/builder). I've
seen Vidal play several times and never thought of him as a
tough-tackling destroyer type – his defensive skills are more about
positioning and angles. However, this might have been because he was
trying to refine his game: when he first game to the BL, he picked up a
ton of cards, so maybe he was trying to take his foot off the gas as far
as making crunching tackles? I don't know, I really only took notice
of him this past season.

Most of my readers think we should snap
him up. I'm not so sure – not because I don't like him, but just
because we already have Bastian, Tymoschuk and Gustavo for two CDM
positions. Vidal can go anywhere he wants for free next year, so my
preference would be to wait a year.

As far as Juve's involvement:
Vidal really seems to want to go to Bayern. Leverkusen would prefer to
sell him outside the country (or at least not to Bayern), so they can
sit on him for the last year of his contract if they want. In that
case, the choice for Vidal would be this: agree to go outside Germany
right now, where you could get a big, multi-year contract and get
financial security right away, or wait a year and have a good chance of
getting a big deal where you would prefer to play (Bayern), but
obviously take the risk that you blow out your knee this year, or that
Bayern just decides they don't want you anymore for whatever reason.

Are
you guys looking to get rid of Felipe Melo, or play him next to Vidal?
Both of those guys on the pitch at once would be a recipe for a TON of
disciplinary problems, IMO.”",Sampath ,"Jul 16, 2011 ", 9:30 PM,

I'm not happy that Sissoko is still here (who's worse these days) while Felipe is leaving and I'll be cautiously awaiting the next CM who will be purchased but if we consider Felipe's departure only, I'm not ripping my hair out. His second season was far better than his first but even with a manager who showered him with love and played him in his natural position Felipe Melo lost it right as things got difficult. The team had had a relatively good season going into the Parma game, and exactly when 'the world class DMC' Felipe Melo was supposed to maybe not lead the team but at least hold his own and continue doing his job, he failed, lost his head and made things much more difficult for his teammates.

Zidane's transfer was emotionally tragic, but, hell, it was a record-setting transfer at the moment and after ten years still remains one of the most expensive transfers in the world! Thanks to Zidane's transfer, we brought Buffon, Nedved and Thuram (I don't count Salas) each of whom played a crucial role in making Juventus the best team in Italy until Calciopoli.

The saddest part about Melo is that we so much lack in quality now that one quality player's departure makes the team look so much more vulnerable and impotent. Besides, my feeling is that we are selling him without really knowing who is going to replace him. It is not like we sold Tacchinardi and brought Emerson and/or Vieira instead. Here, we are reportedly close to Vidal, but few really know if he is even capable of doing what Melo can, regardless of his other qualities.

Anyways, I just hope that Marotta isn't the imbecile most fans portray him to be and will eventually create a competitive team. This time, he doesn't have to clean up the balance sheets and has enough money to improve the team quality-wise.",NI85 ,"Jul 17, 2011 ", 4:03 PM,

Sissoko (24) — Melo (26) — Marchisio (23)
Diego (24)
Amauri (29) - Del Piero (34)

Problems:
Inexperienced coach (who couldn't get the team out of a rut), later replaced by a mediocre coach.
- Team was built around a fantasista without another passer/regista in
the midfield. Stop the fantasista and the entire team stops.
- Disastrous backline: over-the-hill veteran (Cannavaro), a fullback who cannot defend (Grosso), and an inexperienced fullback on the opposite wing (Caceres).
- Play a hairy log upfront who's a big fish in a small pond for the entire season.
- An injury-plagued campaign for most of the season.
- An incompetent management who built the team above.

2010/11: 4-4-2

Krasic (25) — Melo (27) — Aquilani (26) — Marchisio (24)/Pepe (27)
Amauri (30)/Matri (26) - Quagliarella (27)/Del Piero (35)

Problems:
A superbly-tactical coach but with a provincial mentality.
- Disastrous fullbacks.
- 5-8 new faces in the starting XI -> Inconsistencies.
- Spent 12mil for a 4-3-3 winger who turned up fat at pre-season.
- An end-of-season injury in January to a player who had a characteristic (and quality) that fit the system perfectly: defend his porous wing when on defense and attack the box when on offense.
- Play a hairy log upfront who's a big fish in a small pond for half of the season.
- Another injury-plagued campaign for half of the season.

2011/12: 4-4-2/4-2-4
Allenatore: Conte.

Probable line-up:
Buffon (33)/Storari (34)

Krasic (26) — Vidal (24)/Pazienza (29) — Pirlo (32) — Perotti (23)/Pepe (28)
Matri (27) - Rossi (24)/Quagliarella (28)

Upgrades:
A winning mentality coach.
- Competent fullbacks at BOTH wings.
- Bonucci-Chiellini have already had one season under their belts together.
- A world-class regista joined.
- (Hopefully) A major upgrade at LW.
- A famous young Italian goal-scorer (hopefully) joins.

Potential problems:
- An inexperienced Serie A coach.
- In term of defending, the CM combination is much much worse than last season.
- 6-7 new faces in the starting XI -> Inconsistencies.
- Pirlo excelled in 4-3-3. In 4-4-2/4-2-4? Many doubts.

—————————————————————————————————————————————-

We all know that aside from farsopoli, the Secco-led period is the source of all of these problems. The team were infested with aging veterans, mediocre starters and even worse bench (Remember Z3bina, Tiago). We've seen so many players, and coaches, coming in and going out of the squad. Quality and continuity suffer and therefore, the results also suffer.

However, I believe things will change.

Only Buffon and Chiellini (and Del Piero) are still present from the team two years ago. All Secco-ish players are gone from the starting XI so we basically rebuilt within two years.

And the whole team will be without them by the end of the 2011/12 campaign. So we'll undone all of the Secco's work also in two years (since Andrea-Beppe took over in summer 2010). Quality has improved and continue to improve.

So imo, from now on, we won't see so many players injected into the starting XI in the near future and with Conte, hopefully we won't change coaches every year, either. Continuity will improve and as a result, the results will improve.

We've also moved from Blanc-Secco to Andrea-Beppe. Beppe is no Moggi but surely he's a major upgrade from Secco.

Having said that, Beppe (and Andrea) did make mistakes and most probably still will. For every Storari, Sorensen, Krasic, Quagliarella, and Matri, there is a Motta, a Martinez and to some extent, a Pepe. But I think the pluses outweigh the minuses and certainly hope that the minuses get smaller along the way.

There are no shortcuts (well, unless you go calciopoli on other teams like a certain shitty team in 2006) and everything takes time so we probably won't win the scudetto right away.

That is completely different to Melo making an outburst rooted purely in his own inability to be professional. After the awful showing of so many players around him last season, and his own very fine form, how the hell else is he supposed to feel when his agent tells him that the club are seeking his sale???? Its simply an appalling way to treat players. As you mentioned Sampath, we also treated Diego rather poorly…and giovinco…and storari. A team with no class in the way they deal with thei own faithful servants, will fail to attract classy players who expect to be treated with respect…

PotD: Amauri is Thrilled to be Back at Juve,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 11, 2011, 1:04pm PDT",,"Di Vaio's situation is different in my opinion.

Amauri is 31 and he's never scored more than 14 goals in a single, 30+ game Serie A season, whether at Juve, palermo, parma, anywhere. He's mediocre at best and always has been.

Di Vaio has scored a pretty good amount of goals throughout his career and has never really flopped. He didn't light pitches on fire while at Juve but he still did decently well, same thing goes for his French and Spanish experiences. Also, he was trying to leave his mark/find space in a Juve that was far more impressive than the post-Calciopoli one, while Amauri couldn't score a single goal for 51 weeks until he was loaned out and his main striking rival during that time was Iaquinta.

Also, Di Vaio hit 25 goals in 73 matches for Juventus. Not great but definitely a respectable, 1:3 ratio. Amauri has 24 goals, 100 games played and he was paid top striker money. Di Vaio on the other hand, was paid 16 million.",jorid22 ,"Jul 11, 2011 ", 8:47 PM,

He arrived at training last year out of shape and fought all season to get back only to repeatedly get injured. It was a tough pill to swallow. I don't think he's worth the fee we paid for him, but we owe it to the calcio gods to give him another shot. If he fails, burn him at the stake (or just sell him in the winter window, whichever is easier).

DeCeglie might be an interesting option if Ziegler is able to beat him out for the fullback position decidedly. Have we ever deployed Paolo as a true winger? I seem to remember him playing in the midfield a few times, but ever up top?",dweb ,"Jul 12, 2011 ", 1:51 PM,

Ciao mamma, ciao papà, come va, tutto bene?Vi racconterò in breve il mio stato d'animo, quello che provo in questo momento.Mi accomodo molto spesso in panchina, non ho occasione di dimostrare il mio valore come calciatore e come uomo. Molto spesso sono infortunato, i campi di Vinovo sono insidiosi. Torino è una bella città, anche se non c'è il mare. Da me non si pretende molto, anzi, per il poco che faccio, sono pagato molto bene.A volte i tifosi mi contestano, ma fa parte del gioco, d'altronde loro sono dei sognatori, vorrebbero sempre vincere. Io me ne infischio delle contestazioni, vado avanti per la mia strada.Ho la pelle dura, io.Ho peraltro un contratto di lunga durata, chi me lo fa fare di andare in un'altra squadra, a riscuotere meno di adesso? Con la crisi che corre, trovare un contratto a tempo indeterminato come il mio, non è da tutti i giorni.Certo il mio nome non sarà ricordato negli almanacchi della storia bianconera, e con questo?Sono felice qui, perchè ogni estate, quando comincia il raduno, posso sparare quattro cazzate ed il gioco è fatto, la gente si entusiasma con poco.L'anno scorso ho giocato 10 partite (o erano 15? non ricordo) ma mi fermavano per strada, chiedevano l'autografo.Questo mi incoraggia molto.Ho sentito ultimamente che il mio datore di lavoro vuole comprare qualche top player.Sta cosa mi mette allegria, non hanno fatto i conti con me, eh no, io da qui non mi schiodo.D'altronde i contratti sono fatti per essere rispettati, io ed il mio procuratore ci siamo messi daccordo per rifiutare qualsiasi possibile destinazione.Dove lo troviamo un altro posto che ci garantisce quattro milioni l'anno, senza peraltro sudarceli?Qui si parla di dignità, ma che me ne faccio della dignità se poi rischio di perdere questa manna dal cielo?Sti discorsi li lascio ai poeti, qui si difende il posto di lavoro, mica scherzi.Ora vi lascio perchè stasera c'è una festa. Mi sono preparato un discorsetto per la stampa.Sono poche semplici parole, nulla di che: IO VOGLIO RESTARE QUA.Vi voglio bene",jorid22 ,"Jul 13, 2011 ", 1:08 AM,

All the agonizing over Aguero reminds me of 3 years ago (or was it only 2) when we couldn't stop talking about the prospect of getting Amauri and how that would transform us. I'm happy enough with the upgrades of Zieg, Lichst, a rested Krasic and a recovered Quag. Hopeful we retain Melo. Martinez, Motta, Momo, Grosso and Amauri have all overstayed their welcomes. Time to move them out and make way for some of our youth.

The one weak area I foresee is center midfield offense. I think Pirlo will prove to be a mistake, as he's at stage of career where injuries overcome talent (unless you're Giggs or Nedved), but hope I'm wrong. We will miss Aquilani, but I agree his price tag was way too steep. What's left on our squad at center mid offense is mediocre, solid players like Marchisio with minimal creativity. The most exciting rumor of the summer was Aquilani and money for Meireles, but that appears to have been just fantasy, so let's pray for Pirlo's health and look forward to the season ahead.

It Begins! Juventus start summer training in Bardonecchia,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 7, 2011, 3:23pm PDT",,"to those who haven't read it this is what happened in training:

The Bianconeri’s first training session of the 2011/12 season
commenced shortly after 5pm. The team, who had arrived in Bardonecchia
two hours previously, began proceedings with a selection of aerobic
exercises and light stretching, led by new fitness coach Paolo Bertelli.


After half an hour, Conte’s men underwent a number of dribbling
exercises, under the watchful eye of their manager and coaches Carrera
and Stellini. The four goalkeepers worked alongside Claudio Filippi.


The Bianconeri then gathered around the centre circle and played a
passing game, with the ball being circulated amongst 21 players, whilst
three attempted to reclaim possession.


Bardonecchia welcomed Juventus with an ideal climate for the club’s
preparations: a temperature in the region of 20 degrees and sun breaking
through the clouds. In the latter half of the workout, Conte focused on
pattern play, moving the ball around as a unit before shooting at goal.


The session concluded with a 12-a-side game. Wearing yellow bibs
were: Storari, Motta, Sorensen, Barzagli, Chiellini, De Ceglie, Krasic,
Pazienza, Pirlo, Del Piero, Iaquinta and Toni. Their opponents, wearing
white, featured: Kirev, Lichtsteiner, Grygera, Bonucci, Ziegler,
Martinez, Marchisio, Pepe, Matri, Quagliarella and Amauri. Del Piero
connected with De Ceglie’s left-footed cross to put the yellow team a
goal ahead. Conte shuffled his pack throughout the game, introducing
Marrone and De Silvestro, while switching Sorensen to the team in white.
The young Dane scored an unfortunate own goal which left the final
score at 2-0. The Bianconeri are off and running, beginning pre-season
in front of their adoring fans.",Sampath ,"Jul 8, 2011 ", 2:35 AM,

Guys, new guy here from asia. I’ve been wondering for some time regarding the Italian
sports of law and the Andrea Agnelli’s statements. I happen to practice the law
here and basically the system of law have similarity between each other (anglo
saxon and European continental system). So I was wondering for several possibilities
as follows:

1. AAgnelli
said that he reserves any action to any party which damages Juventus’ rights. So,
what am wondering is that, here in my country, we could sue the government should
they violate our rights. And my question is, does FIGC considered as a government
bureau/agency in Italy or not? If they are, is it possible that Juve sue FIGC if
they decide not to decide based on statue of limitation?





2.
I
understand that FIGC may use the statue of limitation’s rule as their argument to
not decide anything. However, the law also provides us the rights to review any
rule (known as Judicial Review) to the higher court to annul such rule. Here we
could submit the application to Supreme Court and how about in Italy? Could
they ask for review to such rule? And after that (if the Supreme Court annuls
the rule) Juve could again ask to FIGC to continue the calciopoli trial.

But I think there will be an amicable solution. A win-win settlement. FIGC knows that Juve wont stop because i believe that the procedures of law will always and naturally will accommodate any remedies. If this is happen (juve go to court) then Juve may probably ask inter relegation, pay the damages, moratti's ban for a life time (like moggi) etc etc. FIGC wont make things harder and longer. Therefore a tittle revocation would be a simple decision. This (maybe) will accepted by Juve, Inter and affordable by FIGC. But i dont know. Its just my two cents.

Why???
Simply, last year clear out was part of the project and the reason why GDN is gone already.
I do believe Aniegli and BM had a clear vision in spring about the players who we will keep and now we have them already without any doubt IMO – Matri,Pepe,Quaqs.
Not the same about Mota but nobody knows how he can transform himself under Conte and i think Conte kept him as Krasic cover (SMART enough if it's real)!
So, Mercato is going nice for us BTW, because all the acquisitions are good and on the much needed positions. Generaly i think BM is doing fine for now. If he keeps going on this way WITHOUT any major (AGUERO) investment but Smart one i'll give him ok for the 2 years in Juve's court.
In all the good aspects that i already mentioned i think there are several Concerns:
1. Defence – I do believe that Conte must have in hand additional dafender who can play either right or left and CD. I heard rumor about Silvestre, but honestly NO THANKS!
Catania made us look like idiots with MALAKA transfer so ….and i don't believe we need exactly that guy – better to take KJAER from wolsburg as serious central defending addition.
Sorensen is already deep in the squad so Conte can use him as natural center back.
2.Pirlo role – we all know that he is world class but i don't think he will be without serious back up. I saw so many articles about Melo leaving but i do think we will make a mistake if we sell him. Yes, he can cover more defence instead of Pirlo and we will suffer but why everybody think VIDAL or Lass are going to do better in different league. For me Pazienza is good solution toghether with MArchisio. Have in hand Melo and we are done. Momo is out for sure so one option as Ekdal will be nice but it doesn't seem happen. In two words – we need cover for Pirlo and we still don't have it, if he get injured …mamma mia, no Aquilani -nobody with that kind of skils.SERIOUS ATTENTION!!!
3.Krasic – we don't pay too much attention about him and we can suffer there as last season – no matter how long he played without rest or how good his right back teamate is he is not gonna be in form all season long and we will not have a good sub for him (may be Mota is Conte's idea) but we all know he's not capable to make 2 good games in a row.The same can be the story on the other flank but at least Pepe tries everything best to the very last moment. Krasic effect is long time gone so he will have difficulties again this year.WE MUST THINK CAREFULLY IN THAT CASE.
So, the season is on his way to come.Let's way a bit and we will se what we can achieve this year. The fight will be very hard this year for the 3 spots already, but if ANTONIO can keep the team motivated as long as possible we will succeed.

But seeing him play, I got a feeling that he's already very close to hit his ceiling so what we've seen is what we'd get. Again, I'd welcome him with open arms and he'd be a valuable addition to our squad but I wouldn't build a team around him.

Sanchez is the most unproven as he's only completed one good season. However, seeing him play it's clear that he has all the tools to be one of the best in the world in a few years time. He makes plays and he scores. It's also very difficult to dispossess him. To me, of the three he'd fit the team best.

Aguero is the most proven goal-getter. Only at 23, he's already had four good la liga seasons under his belt: 27 (19 in la liga), 21 (17), 20 (12), 27 (20) goals respectively. Rossi is faster but Kun is more skillful. Seeing him play imo he has the best goal instinct of the three.",dwicarta ,"Jul 8, 2011 ", 12:55 PM,

Guarin is the best DM so far in the tournament but Vidal is not a bad DM/CM himself. Looks to me that his best attributes are his mobility, tough-tackling, positioning, heading and goal-scoring ability from the 2nd line. He's faster than Melo but his passing is inferior.

It Begins! Juventus start summer training in Bardonecchia,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 7, 2011, 3:23pm PDT",,"AC Milan are one of two premier clubs in Italy which struggled with
finding adequate quality to fill in the slots at full back for the last
couple of years. With the emergence of Ignazio Abate and the
acquisition of Taye Taiwo, Milan have resolved this concern. The other
club that continues to struggle with finding top quality full-backs is
Juventus. Key word there is continues.
Last season, Juventus employed Marco Motta, Zdenek Grygera and
Frederik Sorenson on the right side of defense while Paolo De Ceglie,
Armand Traore, Fabio Grosso and sometimes even Simone Pepe were played
on the left of defense. Sorenson is a centre back and Pepe is a, well,
we are still about to discover that.

For a historic club fielding such names in their defense is clearly
apathetic. Neither Giorgio Chiellini nor Leonardo Bonucci enjoyed
stellar seasons, and Juventus leaked goals like a broken pipe
throughout the season, many admitting that the absence of a water-tight
defense proved to be the shortcoming for the Bianconeri yet again.

Beppe Marotta might have added some additional quality by bringing
in Reto Zeigler and Stephan Lichsteiner for the new season but are
these defenders capable of taking Juventus to the next level?

Marotta fails to realize the magnitude of the club he works for.
Zeigler and Lichsteiner are decent full-backs and a mark up over the
current crop of incompetent athletes at Juventus. But neither of these
defenders would make it into a top three side in Italy, let alone a
Scudetto winning team which Juventus should essentially aim to be.
Marotta possess a transfer kitty believed to be worth €150 million.

Such budgets could purchase players of the highest quality.Or he
could be smart and look for the thrifty options in the market, ala
Taiwo. But he splashes €10 million on Lichsteiner. €10 million! If
reports are to be believed, Mattia Cassani is moving to Lazio for a
lesser sum. Has someone informed Marotta that Italy’s best full backs
played in pink last season and their crazy president is willing to
listen to offers?

Objectively or subjectively, Lichsteiner is not amongst the top 5
right backs in Italy. Those would arguably be Cassani, Douglas Maicon,
Ignazio Abate, Christian Maggio and Mauricio Isla, not necessarily in
that order. And Juventus are supposed to be a world-class club? Marotta
scooped up Zeigler on a free. But that’s the only positive. Zeigler is
a good player going forward but offers very little in defense. That is
admittedly not too different from the present selection of left backs
available to Antonio Conte.

Marotta must be enlightened about the task he is being asked to
fulfill. He is expected to build a great Juventus side which will
remain a dream if the trend of signing above average players continues.
A push for Frederico Balzaretti with a formal bid in the region of €10
million should test Maurizio Zamperini’s will to hold onto the
blonde-haired left back. Balzaretti is a terrific attacking defender
equipped to defend admirably.

Alternatively, moving Chiellini out wide and signing a top class
centre back could also work for Juventus. There aren’t too many
centre-halves available in the market but Christian Zapata is up for
sale. Many have forgotten about Bruno Alves, the Portuguese centre back
who holds immense promise. His stock has nose-dived over the last
couple of seasons and could prove to be a powerful signing.

Juventus play in the Serie A where defenses win games. The four
slots in front of Buffon, especially the two beside the centre backs
are in need of immediate attention. However, the acquisitions of
Zeigler and Lichsteiner might have spelled the end of any such focus
for the near future.",mufid ,"Jul 9, 2011 ", 8:22 AM,

I can talk all day about we should buy this and that, but its not a supermarket.. I can't go to a shelf and look for Balzaretti and see if comes in a range of 10 mill.. or try with Bruno Alves and see if it works or not.. With the likes of Zamparini we will never get andy player form Palermo.. and probably this is why went for an equally good option of Lich..
Juve got the best player available in the market imo .. Conte wanted Lich and he got him.. end of story",IA19 ,"Jul 9, 2011 ", 1:09 PM,

It Begins! Juventus start summer training in Bardonecchia,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 7, 2011, 3:23pm PDT",,"Random thoughts in regards to that:

-The dude who wrote it needs to take a break from the green. Pastorello, being Lichtsteiner's AND Konko's agent, served as an important link to help Marotta succeed in his objective, while helping lazio replace Stephan almost immediately.

-Our fullbacks were shit last season, agreed there. Do I need to remind anybody the fullbacks acm won the title with, though? Don't tell me that Abate, Antonini, Bonera and the 57 year-old Zambrotta are exactly great players lol.

-Purely defensively speaking, Lichtsteiner has nothing to envy of Maicon, Abate, Cassani, Isla and Maggio. None of these guys are exactly tremendous defenders (Licht included). They are all good players, with Maicon still being quality when he feels like it. This past season, like IA19 mentioned, Maicon played way below what he's capable of and on the same level as Lichsteiner, if not below him.

-acm picking up Taiwo for free was a very smart move. Again though, Taiwo, defensively speaking, is nothing special. Overall, he's a good player who will come in very handy to a team fighting on three fronts, and he's got some good qualities (great physically, good free kick taker, pretty decent crossing, okay defending, important playing experience) but he's not going to be much of a game changer. Look at the qualities of Taiwo I described and try to see if Ziegler matches any of them. The similarities are all there.",jorid22 ,"Jul 9, 2011 ", 2:32 PM,

Even if what we saw was his peak, I am happy to have him, for the rest of the team can only improve, which means more chances for Matri…and he has already shown that even when we are awful, he will still score goals.

- Gazzetta reported that there would be a plan for a Juve-Samp meeting tomorrow to close the deal for Poli, who was valued at 10mil. In the last hour, his teammate Gastaldello (28, CB) enters the equation. Almiron, Ekdal, Giandonato, Manninger, Marrone were all mentioned as part of the negotiation.

- The merda have joined the race for Vidal's signature. He's currently valued at 15mil and it can still go up during the copa america. The papers believe that we still lead the race.

- Diarra was dropped from RM's america's tour and it's rumored that he himself requested it as he believed he would only be 4th in the pecking order behind Alonso, Sahin and Khedira. Rumor has it that he's still looking for interests from the EPL. The papers said that we were still monitoring the situation although Vidal had overtaken him.

—————————————————————————————————————————————-

I don't know whether it's Poli AND Vidal or Poli OR Vidal. Imo, they are of different types. Vidal is a DM/mezz'ala and Poli is a sub covering for Pirlo so maybe both.

Assuming Almiron, Ekdal, Marrone and Tiago won't be with us it means we'll have Pirlo, Poli, Marchisio, Pazienza, Vidal, Melo and Sissoko. That's seven players vying for two slots.

From the team's point of view, it's clear that contract rescission is the best but I'm 99% sure Iaquinta won't take a penny less and I wouldn't blame him. With his well-documented injury history, he won't get anything above 500k/year anywhere next season. He'll also need to be on the team for medical purposes. He'll stay and see the contract out.

So just to make things clear:
Our prima punta department consists of: Ale “The Machine Gun” Matri, Luca “The Ent*” Toni (*See The Lord of the Rings), Amauri “The Hairy One” Carvalho de Oliveira, and Vincenzo “The Mother of All Injury Prone” Iaquinta.

From Football-Italia:
""I hope there is a decision on July 18. We have the resources to move even beyond the sporting justice system, but at this moment we don’t want to do that and will wait to see how the FIGC proceeds.""

From Juventus.com
In 2006 we were the only club to suffer from serious economical damages, discernible in various hundreds of millions of Euros. Now we noticed that the other clubs, especially Inter, had unclear behaviours. We’re waiting for the decisions and then we’ll see. We’ve always respected the sports law, but we also have the suitable means to differently operate , even if we don’t want to do it by now. As far as the sports law is concerned, our oppositions will come to an end if the title will be taken away from Inter. However, the ordinary law proceedings are still ongoing and we’ll see which will be their end.

Do you guys have any idea what the bold parts means? Bring the matter to UEFA/FIFA?

The former coach of Palermo and Lazio, Delio Rossi, guest of honor of “Speciale calciomercato” of Sportitalia, spoke about the new signing of Juventus, Stephan Lichtsteiner,
a player he knows well, having coached in his experience on the bench
Biancocelesti . Here are his statements, taken from TuttoJuve.com:
""I'm
not into the merits of the economic assessment, also because I honestly
am not a pharmacist, I do not have the sling and it's not my job, so I
can't give an assessment. I can talk about Lichtsteiner , the boy. I can also tell an anecdote to show who that guy is.

Holy God: FIGC Lawyer Accuses Inter of Same Behavior as Juve in 2006,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 4, 2011, 10:41am PDT",,"From my friend Giuseppe-


“Palazzi was instructed to pour over all the evidence that emerged a year ago in the Naples trial and needed to come to a conclusion as to whether the information was a) irrelevant b) too late because the statute of limitations had expired c) reopen the case.Because it took the douchebag a year and change to conclude his ""investigation"" (which took 3 weeks in 2006) the entire thing fell out of statute which means no one will be getting further punished.The title Guido Rossi handed Inter can still be revoked however and likely will when the league officials convene for a meeting on July 18th.


His 72 page release states a few key points.Remember that Juventus was never relegated for article 6 violations (attempts at obtaining an advantage in the standings through actions like match fixing) because none could be found. The team was relegated due to a summarization of article 1 violations (unsportsmanlike conduct) which up until that point had only ever resulted in fines and in extreme cases 1-3 point penalty.

The release from Palazzi (FIGC Chief Investigator) claims that had the information been analyzed properly in 2006 the following people and their respective teams would have been found guilty of violating article 1 along with Juventus:Cellino (Cagliari), Campedelli (Chievo), Foschi (Palermo), Gasparin (Vicenza), Governato (Brescia), Corsi (Empoli), Spalletti (Udinese, coach), Foti (Reggina), Moratti (Inter) and Meani (Milan).

The following would have been found guilty of violating article 6 and should have therefore been relegated.Spinelli (Livorno), Facchetti (Inter) and Meani (Milan).In other words Juventus should have never been relegated and Inter, Milan and Livorno should have been.Basically they said that those guys at Juventuz have been right for years.

Nothing will happen. The case is out of statute now. The scudetto of honesty will likely be revoked and never reassigned and that’s it.”",agiamba ,"Jul 4, 2011 ", 5:01 PM,

And of course it is time to read something again:

The
criminal trial currently under way in Naples has had its turning point
in April 2010. The output of a series of “new” phone calls surfaced
thanks to the work of defense, although initially had the effect of
galvanizing the bianconeri fans forced to suffer for too long the
moral of the Inter fans, so has led to some media (not all) to wake up
from sleep and bear on a process that was done in oblivion, but also
has had the “side” effect probably too distracted attention from the
sports judgments in 2006, and shamefully unjust in part, to open the
doors of “gossip”, always looking for “new phone calls”, more and more
beautiful, more and more spicy. ""Did you hear the latest one of Facchetti?"" ""And Moratti with Bergamo?"" “Collina-Meani did you heard that?"" ""Revenge”,
in a sense. The defeat of the hypocrisy of the world of football.
Beware, though: remember to trombones friends the phone calls of “I
could not ask this, because you were not able” Giacinto Facchetti are a good and a just thing, as it was that Juventus
complaint to the Football Federation asking for equal treatment. Now,
however, this phase is completed, it would be good to step back, get
back with the mind to the judgments of 2006 and, once and for all,
finally justice be done.


Before
we even ask the punishment for those who escaped, in short, we should
regain our dignity. And this comes primarily from a correct information,
then an understanding of what happened in 2006 and, finally, inevitably
(and inevitably it will be “weighted”), the desire by the Juventus Club to fight for their own history. What has made responsible Moggi by
Sports Justice? We begin to revive the judgments sports. It 'easy to
demonstrate not only how it was all a farce, but even then they had
available information to formulate different objections, more “right”.
Not even having the phone calls “di Penta”.

might say it is a never ending story. It must be clear that no one here
wants to complain about the work of Italian magistrates. It remains
unclear, however, the reason for such fierceness against a club like
Juventus: it is true, those in power are more exposed to suspicion. That
said, one thing are the headlines, the assumptions…different thing is
a penal prosecution, with attached the cost to be borne by the State
and working hours for magistrates who’d better deal with more important
issues for the life of the country. Again, this is not a preventive
criticism, it rather is an impartial observation that everyone could
make retrospectively. We use the conditional because if the average
citizen is not informed of the facts, the reality then is certainly
twisted.

The doping trial.
It was 1998. Who can forget Zeman’s accusations? Turin Prosecutor
Guariniello opened an investigation. The trial began. There were rumors
of anomalous values (two out of hundreds of controls, statistically less
than those found in a normally healthy population), there were rumors
of EPO. As a result of the first instance, Giraudo was acquitted while
Dr.Agricola judged guilty. On appeal, in 2005, they were both acquitted.
On March 29, 2010, the Supreme Court ended the debate: Juventus was
fully acquitted of doping (it was proved, in short, that there was no
use of EPO or other prohibited substances). .(13)
It should be noted, however, that the Supreme Court does not enter into
the merits of the sentences: it follows that, at worst, the trial
should have been revised from the start.

Holy God: FIGC Lawyer Accuses Inter of Same Behavior as Juve in 2006,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 4, 2011, 10:41am PDT",,"Not to raise our hopes, or even bask in the glory of Inter's hypocrisy, I just want to mention these few points to be completely clear with those who are not really familiar with how it works:

The Statute of Limitations is over and done for the case, meaning that this case will not go to trial, they will not be punished and they will not be even considered as a guilty party in Calciopoli. Best case Scenario is that the Scudetto's are revoked and put in the FIGC lockers along with the 2005 ones and never discussed again.

However, there are 3 Scenario's that the Statute of Limitations can actually be excluded or extended from:

1) Fraud upon the Court: If say an officer of the law, that has something to do with the case at question presented fraudulent documents or facts, then in this situation the Statute of Limitations is Excluded, and the case can go on trial – This is almost impossible, unless Moggi beats on one of the Lawyers from back then.

2) Evidence: Say if Moggi were to reveal calls that occurred within the last 5 years that directly related to the Calciopoli case of 2006 that may present a different ruling, then the court could select to re-open the case.

3) Moratti waving the Statute of Limitations: Moratti can wave the Statute of Limitations to clear Giancarlo Fachetti's name, now we all know they are as guilty as fuck so the chances of them actually doing that is almost 0%. However, should more beating on Moratti and Fachetti occur, along with Moggi's pressure to “If you still think you're honest, wave the Statute of Limitations” threat, then it is very possible that he could do that to clear his and Fachetti's name.

To sum it up, nothing will happen, shit will remain the same, the FIGC will never understand that they destroyed Juventus for over half a decade and will never take action on anything based on that. They are a bunch of pussies who back then didn't give a fuck about the Italian League, but now since we lost 3rd CL spot to Bundesliga, will be more cautious in these matters.

Also on a side note, I'm from Dubai as most of you know, and I'm getting info from Abu Dhabi that Nasri to Man-City is 90% done, and that Mancini wants either Rossi or Aguero to spearhead his attack instead of Tevez.

In any case, if Aguero were to go to Real, and it was us and Man City on Rossi, you know how this will end.",Tariq Falaknaz ,"Jul 6, 2011 ", 2:38 AM,

Tomorrow the team will leave for the pre-season training of Bardonecchia, but this morning the Juventus players are meeting at Vinovo for medical examinations: examinations and physical tests in view of the athletic work which will be done right in Bardonecchia.

The first to arrive at the sports center in Vinovo, shortly before 8 am – Sky Sports reports – was Captain Del Piero, who began the nineteenth season at Juventus with such enthusiasm:

to elaborate further more.. I can tell you that of what I know … the things could turn bad in the Kun deal.. but this won't be a failure really…

If chelsky, shity and real will pay the Clause … really we can't do anything about it.

The idea is that we will buy at least one Top Player until the end of the summer…and if we will take Pepito instead of El Kun then there is a chance that we will take 2 Top players…

Holy God: FIGC Lawyer Accuses Inter of Same Behavior as Juve in 2006,The Offside Juventus,"Jul 4, 2011, 10:41am PDT",,"i have been following this story for 5 years now…my understanding of such matters has been greatly increased by gsol( who I think is aaron's mate)…its fine to see many members spouting anger, rage, rancourous threats, but the majoroty of US are far removed from Italy. It does not make a supporter MORE juventino to declare their outrage. Its understandable, expected, but in no way constructive. Its brilliant, that its now been proven, as I wrote in lengthy detail to footballitalia earlier today, that the bottom line is this, as I hope gsol agrees with, as he will always know much more than me regarding this issue…:we, amongst a multitude of others, were proven to have commited several misdemeanours, in relation to article 1. violations which can be…one of our players headbutting another player, one of our officials, speaking out of turn against an FIGC official, one of our players swearing into the camera..Article 1 violations DO NOT gain us an advatnage, at worst, they should cost us a fine, and a scolding of the players or officials (of Juve) involved.

However…we were relegated, and stripped of two titles, due to a collection of Article 1 violations. When there was zero precedent for such a punishment. Dig deeper, and you find that the very people who punished us, and created new punishments for collections of article 1 violations, some of them, were INTER people…Also, there is a secondary depth, which shows, if you follow and understand well enough the $ trail, that the very people who fucked us over, not long after, entered into $ agreements with Juventus…The only other thing worth mentioning is that there was always a war between John Elkann ( I cannot include Lapo), vs…the triade.palazzi has said, basically, that we, with many other clubs were guilty of Article 1 of the sporting code of justice misdemeanours. That normally, will lead to a fine, or 1-3 points deduction in the league table. Unfortunately for us, it was Inter who was the judge and jury!As for match-fixing, lets say CHEATING…several clubs Palazzi charged. We were not one of them, but both milanese clubs WERE…Article 6 violations demand immediate relegation.Those seem the facts…apologies gsol, if I haven't studied your words vigorously enough!So the nut of the matter is this:We got done.And now…not long after the statute of limitations has passed, Inter and Milan (and others), have been charged with Article 6 violations, which should have their teams relegated. Juventus have been charged with no match fixing. we have not been charged with cheating. However, Inter and Milan, and the other clubs charged with Article 6 violations, will get off fine and dandy, due to the statute of limitations, and at best, Inter will be stripped of the title they stole from us. ..

But we wont get that title officially re-assigned to us. Moggi will continue, but Moggi is fighting for Moggi, not Juventus.Our only slim hope of anything meaningful for us all occurring, is for Juventus to do as so many of us now demand : look at the evidence: we didnt cheat, other clubs did cheat, we got relegated, lost two titles, and its simply not good enough, for those teams, who should have had OUR punishment, to simply now stay quiet, and happily go about their business.

for now…all we can expect is for Inter to be stripped of a title they didn't win. Anything more will be a bonus, unfortunately. But at least we have been shown to have not been involved in match fixing, and Inter and Milan HAVE.",thegutterpoet ,"Jul 6, 2011 ", 7:56 AM,

In Corso Galileo Ferraris do not want to waste time, especially to anticipate potential pitfalls from Premier League. Manchester City and Chelsea have indeed economic means difficult to counter, so better to close before Roberto Mancini and Andre Villas Boas are to think of “bad thoughts”, even if the Portuguese manager of Chelsea would have revealed to friends not to bet on the son of Maradona . Tuesday Beppe Marotta will arrive in Madrid, ready to pay 35 million into Atletico coffers, but with the hope that the cash outlay can be mitigated by the inclusion of one or two technical counterparts.

Officially Official: Juve Announce Lichtsteiner,johncas,"Jul 1, 2011, 7:43am PDT",,"His game is about breaking up play, dominating the central midfield area and playing the ball simple. that is why he is usually played along a ball playing midfielder, like aquilani…If he goes walkabout all he leaves in the middle is Aquilani and Marchisio, neither of who have a solid physical presence sturdy enough to secure the central midfield area. Ciro asked him to play as a regista, and we all saw how horrible that turned out! So I know what you mean, i think, mate…I guess I just defend Big Phil whenever I see the opportunity, because he was the only player other than Storari and Sorensen, who brought me any real joy last season, and his attitude and consistency were brilliant…(yes! I know…other than against Parma…)

I always admire players who make their presence felt whenever they play. In central midfield, as at centre back, its the two areas where the players MUST thrust themselves into the thick of the action constantly. As the English say after a CB or CM has made a solid challenge…'he is just letting his opponent know he is there'…We have lacked this kind of player since 2006, players who truly impose themselves on their position. Chiellini can do it, and does, but was not at his best last season, though much of that was due to us playing so much of Grosso. Melo can do it. But who else??? Buffon when in form…its those players, who in 50/50s, purely by their stature and aggressiveness and tenacity alone, make a 50/50 into a 70/30 in their favour. Melo can do that very well indeed.

But then again, perhaps Conte is aiming for the perfect situation of two decent players battling for each position. With Bastos the obvious choice for the wide left forward in a 4-2-4 with cerci challenging him for that spot. And on the other wide spot of the offence, Krasic the main man, with vucinic able to challenge. Vucinic could also challenge one of the central duo in a 4-2-4, of Matri and Aguero, along with Quagiarella.

I know very little of Vidal, other than what I have read, but with a Lampard-esque amount of assists and goals last season, he seems more a direct challenger for Pirlo's spot in central midfield, if that is, we ARE aiming for a 4-2-4. Sticking with Vidal, from Marrota's words, I assume it will be Vidal OR Diarra, not both, strange as it may seem as they seem very different players. One massively more defensive, the other massively more capable offensively, though also able to muscle in defensively. If either of them come IN, are we assuming that Melo will leave? I would rather see Marchisio go…lovely chap, but has never seemed more than a useful squad player to me.

Danilo is another player I know very little about. He comes highly reccomended, and apparently is able to play RB, CB, and DM. Could he be our star non-eu signing?

If we are to sign Danilo, Vidal, Aguero, Vucinic, Bastos…without doubt we are aiming for lo scudetto. No other team aiming for even the top three has yet strengthened as potently as that list, especially when you add in Ziegler, Pirlo, Pazienza and Lichsteiner.

Buffon/Storari
Lichsteiner/Danillo Bonucci/Barzagli Chiellini/Sorensen Ziegler/De Ceglie
Melo/Marchisio Vidal/Pirlo
Krasic/Quagiarella Matri/ Vucinic Aquero/DP Bastos/Cerci

thats an amazing team.

Aside from WHO we will buy, and WHO we will sell, which is down to Conte, it appears, thankfully, as much as Beppe, I am grateful to Johnny Elkann…who has been so much maligned, for investing 70m+ into the team, after a second atrocious season, and with huge losses, for now, on the new stadium. He is well aware of what Juve means to us all and his family. And from a business point of view, it makes little sense to invest heavily, so…I suggest, that he sees Juve as he should…as in something to be proud of, a plant to water and fertlize, not solely with the aim in mind of making $, but out of pride, for owning one of the few clubs in the world of immense historical prestige.

structure to undergo such punishment leaves you bewildered. Now there is
a desire for rebirth and you feel that they can quickly return to
compete. The duo Agnelli-Conte is of great quality and Juventinita,
Andrea is the last one with that name, there is no one after him. He has
a great passion and skill, is a boy with his head on his shoulders that
he will certainly deliver. Antonio also has in his DNA Juventus, the
great captain won so many battles and to reach here was his biggest
dream I guess after the good ranks. Now he has to take other steps, the
club planns to buy important players and to build a team full of
Juventinita, with desire, anger and agony on the field mixed with
quality. But I remember when I arrived at Juventus in 1994 there were
eight years since Juventus wasn’t winning seeing the great AC Milan of
the time. In a few was the thought that we would have won right away and
instead of winning we created an extraordinary mixture that led us not
to win, but win the league the cup and play Uefa Cup final . If the

The things are simple – 30-40 mln are money enough to upgrade seriously the team which we already have in hand. Don't get me wrong but i do believe AGUERO IS NOT A LEADER. Having in mind we need leaders aka GIGI,ADP,PIRLO so the guy is out of that list. if he was the leader atletico must be in the sky till now, but unfortunately they are NOT and not gonna be SOON with that kind of LEADERS they have!!!
I will salute Marotta if he keeps his mouth smartly closed for all the transfer window and in the end we have PASTORE in. As somebody mention It can be a massive move having in mind crazy money for Sanchez,Aguero etc. I don't believe Pastore is not in Conte's favourite, because the system he will play is gonna look more 433 instead of 442 which is suitable for him. I do believe Aguero is good addition but nothing MORE. FOR THAT AMMOUNT OF MONEY WE CAN BRING AT LEAST 3 GOOD signings who will boost recent team quality on the right positions.

It will always be possible until he signs for another club. Maybe I'm just keeping my expectations low for this particular story, so that I won't be disappointed when the inevitable happens. See, I just did it again! :p

And no, I don't have any inside scoop. I'm just another tifosi, not Marotta's nephew nor Caliendo's right hand. I just think that in terms of “needs”, Aguero is nowhere near the top of Juve's priority. Heck, I think we need Danilo more than we need Aguero, simply because Danilo would surely kick Motta out of Juve.

This whole story reminds me of Moggi and his smokescreen (I never understand what smokescreen is/was useful for, perhaps someone can enlighten me?). Perhaps Marotta is doing just that? Raising stories about big transfer targets while he chases the small to medium ones in peace?

To clarify, I would love to see Aguero in Bianconero, but I don't want him to come simply because “we offer more money”. And while Aguero would really raise the quality of our attack, I think we have more holes to worry about right now. Like left winger for 4-4-2/4-2-4, or right forward for 4-3-3.

With our current squad, I can't shake the thought that we'll play 4-3-3 with Quags in the left, Krasic in the right, and Matri in the middle. Not too bad? Well, look at it this way, Krasic has been deemed one dimensional in too many occasions. He'll run to the byline 90% of the time. He doesn't really suit 4-3-3. Lichtsteiner will support him, true, but if both of them prefers to run to the byline, then it will easy to defend against. Quags, on the other side, will cut inside 90% of the time, hoping for Reto/PDC to provide width. Which is perfect for 4-3-3.

Another note is that for a 4-3-3 to work perfectly, you'll need one of the 3 central midfielders to pop up in the penalty box while being able to pressure the opposition DM. Someone like Lampard or Iniesta or Hamsik. I presume this will be the role of Marchisio, but this is a big IF. Currently, we don't have this kind of midfielder.

The above is my humble analysis of 4-3-3 and the kinds of player that it needs. If I start talking about 4-4-2 or 4-2-4, we have even more holes to fill. And Aguero, IMO, is not someone who can fill those holes.",JDAngkasa ,"Jul 4, 2011 ", 3:52 AM,

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"Lucian Moggi talks about the mercatto:

“Il mercato della Juventus è migliore rispetto a quello degli anni
passati. Quest’anno è stato fatto un passo avanti anche se la Juve non è
competitiva come Milan, soprattutto, e Inter. Può lottare con il Napoli
per il terzo-quarto posto”

“I top player? Non facendo le coppe, si ha una perdita di immagine e
quindi è più difficile che arrivino. La Juventus sta costruendo una
buona squadra, piano piano si migliora. Non ci sono Melo e Sissoko ma ci
sono Vidal e Pirlo che però è un punto interrogativo sul lato fisico. – sottolinea Moggi – Vidal
è un buon giocatore, farà bene il suo dovere. Su Giaccherini ho i miei
dubbi, si adatta agli schemi di Conte ma giocare col Cesena è un conto,
con la Juventus è un altro. Estigarribia è un jolly, fare due o tre
partite bene in Coppa America non lo fa diventare un campione. Elia è un
buon giocatore, non c’è dubbio. Sul centrale difensivo hanno fatto bene
a non prendere Lugano, andato al PSG, e Alex perché non erano
congeniali, come loro c’è già Chiellini. Credo in Conte. Ha il Dna
giusto, ha bisogno del sostegno societario. Il paragone con la Juve del
’94 di Lippi però è sbagliato, noi avevamo già una bella base su cui
partire”.

________________________

My best stab at it:

- Juve is better than last year, it was a step forward
- Juve is not competitive yet with Inter and Milan, they can fight for 3rd 4th place with Napoli
- Without Europe the appeal of Juve decreases and thus it is hard to get top players
- Juventus is building a good squad, it is improving.
- There is no Melo or Sissoko but there is Pirlo and Vidal (question marks over how physical this pair will be).
- Vidal is a good player and will do well with what is asked of him
- I (Moggi) have my doubts about Giaccherini. He is the type of winger that Conte requires but one thing is to play for Cesena and something else is to play for Juve.
- Estigarribia e un jolly?? (I have no idea what that means, someone else feel free). Playing 2 or 3 good games in Coppa America doesn't make him a champion
- Elia is a good player
- Good thing they didn't sign Lugano (I don't know why he is against Lugano, I wish he commented more, age?, speed?, stamina? dedication?)
- Good thing Alex didn't come either, Chiellini is like him.
- I (Moggi) believe in Conte, he has the right DNA, he needs support from the club.
- The comparison with Marcelo Lippi's squad is wrong, we had a beautiful base from which to start from

I am surprised as to his attitude about the mercatto, he seems more subdued than ever before.",JoseR ,"Aug 30, 2011 ", 6:06 PM,

I have been dreaming and calling for this signing since last year when we hired del neri. Juventus is now almost the finish product just needing that 1 CB. No more experimenting with Marchisio and Vidal as LW we finally have a LW winger with creativity, brilliant dribbling skills and blistering pace. If Elia can live up to my expectations of him and krasic play the way he did to start last season with us…. oh my word, the rest of serie a better watch out.

I think he's more subdued than usual because he knows that getting true champions is almost impossible right now, and that we need to take steps.

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"How can anyone be convinced we were Elia's last resort/option? He seemed happy in Germany, his club seemed far from desperate to sell. Hamburg did Ok last season, as did Elia, who also remained throughout on the fringes of the presently number one ranked nation in the world dutch team.

Conte has shown already, as a manager and always as a player, that he likes players with his kind of determination and fierce desire to succeed. Why else would we have loaned out Melo? We were not desperate for the $…he was our best player last season. I assume it was Conte, who thought there was no room in his vision for the team, for Melo's suspect temperament, no matter fine a player he can be on his day. Also, our other signings have been mentally strong people. Pirlo, Vidal, Lichsteiner, Giaccherini (yes…any man who nearly dies from a football match, then fights back, all the way to the top, well, near the top, has an iron will), pazienza, estagarribia (talks of grinta often). Ziegler is no lightweight mentall either, very sturdy, like most swiss folk. all of the players we have brought in have a great mentality. So why would Conte agree to, even request, this signing, of a player who some of you assume had little interest in Juventus, a dodgy ego and a tendency towards childish shows of foolishness?

Where is the evidence of him desperately wanting to play for Arsenal? Its not that hard to find links between elia and liverpool, arsenal, juventus…are they all true?

I am happy for the addition of a left winger of real pace, some trickery and the desire to beat players and get into the box. Estagarribia seems more a 'hug the touchline then make space to cross' kind of winger, pasquato is more a 'break through with pace then have a pop from long range or cross the ball' player.

NAME
Eljero

SURNAME
Elia

CAREER
Eljero George Rinaldo Elia was born in Voorburg, the Netherlands, February 13, 1987.
Arrives in the youth of 'ADO Den Haag in 1996, when he was just 9 years but his
love affair with football began even earlier, in the teams of kids of his hometown.

From '96 to 2000, therefore, plays for youngsters of the yellow-green club until club until Ajax calls him.
The temptation is great and Elia does not think twice about it: he moved to the youth of the team in Amsterdam where, however, does not impress the professionals, who after a couple of years bounce him away.

In 2002 he returned to Den Haag and in 2004, just seventeen, he made his debut with the first team to take home at the end of the season, only 4 appearances accompanied by a goal.

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"Mercato is closed for Juve, players can be sold still (hoping Iaquinta, and Amauri make their way out). As it stands:

Goalkeepers:

Buffon, Storari, Manninger (best GK line up in Italy)

Defenders:

Lichsteiner, Motta, Bonucci, Barzagli, Sorensen, Chiellini, De Ceglie, Ziegler, Grosso

Midfielders:

Krasic, Pepe, Giaccherini, Pazienza, Marchisio, Vidal, Pirlo, Marrone, Elia, Estigarribia

Forwards:

Iaquinta, Amauri, Del Piero, Vucinic, Quagliarella, Matri, Toni

We currently have 29 players for Serie A and Coppa Italia. I suspect Grosso, Iaquinta, and Amauri will be sidelined and will see little or no playing time. This leaves us with 26 players which is a very good number.

On paper the squad looks decent (just like last year). However there are 10 new signings (counting Marrone) out of which 5 will probably be starters so there is lots of work to be done there. On top of that our coach is new and the team lacks identity still, something else that will take time.

This is also about the first time in many years when players coming from the bench may be able to affect the outcome of it. Most importantly, if a starter is injured or suspended (not unlikely give our luck) a decent replacement should be available (with the exception of Lichsteiner). If PDC, Quags, and Krasic were injured, Ziegler, Vucinic, and Elia could easily take their place (with Giacc or Estigarribia playing LW), how long ago is it that we could say that?. If Bonucci and Chiellini both get injured, I am unsure how Barzagli and Sorensen can cope for 3 or 4 Serie A matches together. Sorensen surprised me once, maybe he can do it again.

I will give the mercato a 7.5/10, too many changes for my liking (some where unnecessary, others weren't). No new CB is more of a problem for me than the fact that Aguero, CR7, and Messi were not signed. Maybe Marotta has something else lined up for January.

Lastly, all this work is for nothing if Conte is fired next year, and that will happen if Juve don't make it to CL. With Roma's and Napoli's signings I think Juve have a tough road ahead. We are not of the level of Milan, but I see Inter, Napoli, Roma, Lazio, and Juve capable of fighting for the other 2 spots with an advantage to Napoli and Lazio who have changed little yet remain strong.

- We paid to keep Pepe when we know we do not need him. Next season he will be sold for peanuts.

- With trying to sell Bonucci and eventually keeping him and not getting any good CB, the guy's confidence must be shattered now and God knows how his performance will be. There was no need for all this hassle, if the chance of signing a new CB was close to null.

Goods:
-Fantastic free transfers
-Not a single player we overpaid for
-Most acquisitions are either versatile or bought for a specific purpose (except Pirlo, who's in just for the class)
-Pretty decent depth to buffer injuries
-A lot more hungry and gritty squad with a sense of competition for almost every position
-Pasquato's loan (while some might disagree) is going to prove extremely beneficial to us, provided we treat him well when he's back next season. Can someone confirm if this is a paid loan, where he cannot be recalled incase of an injury crisis?

No Party Because:
-Much of the deadwood not sold and it still eats into the wages. Will give us NO returns for Grosso, Motta, Vincenzo Glassman and The Tree next summer.
-No new CB (injuries covered for everywhere but at CB and RB)
-Too many promises and public declarations with no results
-Ziegler's treatment

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"In a sense I see what you are saying, they should leave because they won't be playing, and most likely then won't even warm up the bench.

W, I think, said to remember these guys need to make as much money as possible so I am trying to see it from their point, in addition there are other major players when making a decision like moving. Some players have often accepted or rejected moves based on what their significant others say or do. I can understand that. Other people really like where they live and are content staying even if that means no playing time.

As a fan, I wanted them to leave, I didn't care where. If Amauri, Iaquinta and Grosso went to Afghanistan, Siberia, and Edmonton (cold city where I live in Canada) i would be ecstatic. Personally, I would take a not ideal situation at work, if it allowed me to have ideal situations elsewhere in my life(be close to my family, kids, etc).

I really doubt Amauri, Grosso, and Iaquinta are staying at Juve gladly as they won't be playing and the value of their services will significantly decrease. I just hope there are other situations at hand (otherwise I could not justify their decision).

This whole mess lies entirely in the management of Secco and to an extent Gigli and Blanc. Amauri shouldn't have a 4m contract when in his best season he scored 15 goals. Matri had more goals last season and his contract is not near 4m. Iaquinta shouldn't have a contract that expires in 2014, he has reached an age in which contract should only be extended 1 or 2 years at a time maximum, and that for a superstar striker, not for Vincenzo. Grosso shouldn't even be here, let alone in a 2m+ salary. Out of all the left backs that Juve could have made a deal for that should never have happened.

Marotta is not an amazing DS but he was able to send his flop (Martinez) on loan to try to get value for him. If Elia flops, his 1.3m salary should be manageable for most clubs wanting him. Even the fact that there was a rumored interest for Ziegler, Pepe, and Bonucci speaks volumes of the fact that their contracts and prices are fair in this crazy market.

Anyway, circumstances are forcing me to move somewhere where I don't want to for a little while, so I can relate to these guys who are still in our roster to a degree. I myself might have called them unprofessional or something but I can see part of where they are coming from now (no, my salary at where I am going won't be 3.7m this year and 2.5m for the next 2 years which is what Marseille supposedly offered Amauri).",JoseR ,"Aug 31, 2011 ", 8:22 PM,

- Not the mercatto that has been promised in June. And I'm not talking about the promised “big signings”. I wouldn't wanted Aguero for 30 mil anyway. But the team should have been strengthen in its weakest points.
- Amauri, Iaquinta, Grosso still in the squad. Sissoko, Grygera, Almiron, Tiago, Martinez(temporarily) – shipped out, this is good but just not enough.
- Melo on loan to Galatasaray. Not give him at least a chance? To sell him with a price of 13-16 mil – that I agree, but to loan (for peanuts with no real guarantee of a buy) our last season's best player, and in Turkey? . He could easily fit in a 3 men midfield and be a powerful contender for Vidal and Marchisio. Ok, big salary, but at least he deserved it.
- How about the rumors of Quagliarella, Bonucci,
Ziegler, Pepe and even Krasic leaving?
- I
don't agree with Marotta being the tool and Conte the brain. Conte
should obviously have the right to veto Beppe's proposals and consult
him in the mercatto but not viceversa. This obsession with 4-2-4 reminds me of a certain Ranieri and Delneri. Where are they now?
- Motta and Pepe bought and Aquilani missed out? Oh, please.
- Pirlo, Vidal, Vucinic, Lichsteiner, Ziegler, Matri, Quagliarella – quality buys on decent prices nevertheless.
- Pazienza, Giaccherini? i thought we were done with the “quantity” side last season. We already have Pepe.
- Loan Pasquato and buy Elia? Until he proves that I'm wrong, Elia is just another Martinez or Traore to me.
- Estigarribia. I classify that as an interesting buy.
- Not enough quality buys in defense.

- Significant upgraded the LB from Mediocre Motta to Lich

- Major upgrade on the LW from Marchisio/Pepe to Elia, a real left winger with raw potential and is a Dutch international.

- With Elia out on the LW Serie A sides can't afford to double Krasic because this kid is even deadlier than Milos in terms of pace and trickery when he's on form. That means we'll see the Milos that started the season with us and gave us all hope of a brighter future.

- We got a proven winner in MF (Pirlo) who can dictate the tempo of a match from middle an execute beautiful passes. He will also be well rested having only 1 match per week.

- Vidal was also a major pick-up imo and hopefully he can be even better for us than he did last season

- Bonucci will be alright, hopefully he take what almost happen to him and play with a chip on his shoulder. Plus this is the year of the EUROs surely he want to be considered for the starting job and that can be achieve by forming a solid partnership with Cheillini the way he did with Ranocchia at Bari. Melo had a poor 1st season with us and rebounded with a solid 2nd season, hopefully the same can happen with Bonucci.

- From what I saw in preseason friendlies Conte have our defense set up similarly to the way Mourinho had merda defense set up, 4 across the MF before u can breach the 4 backline.

Has anybody thought that, shit, I don't know, maybe this season will be another disastrous one, that Conte will get the boot come May, that we will have the umpteenth new 'project' next season and that maybe the new coach won't find Pasquato useful to his plans and he'll get sold to the Bologna or Genoa or Parma of the situation for a few million Euros?

I know Moggi was a master but getting players like Cannavaro while sending Carini the other way are not deals that happen every year. Besides, Carini was a decently rated goalkeeper at the time the deal was struck, Moggi just saw him for what he was a training. In that light, I would say that the Diego deal, seeing how things turned out, was a pretty good one too.

Part of the problem is the salaries which the players don't want to miss out and most clubs can't match. Second is the time the players have sucked. Grygera, Amauri, Iaquinta, Grosso haven't started a game with a fully fit squad for years. When they play is because everyone is injured which makes it hard to sell.

Last is that for Juve to make a profit, the players need to be sold a ridiculous prices, because of the high price we paid for them. Amauri is worth 5m or 6m in our books I believe, so we need to sell him for over that to make a profit, it is just hard.",JoseR ,"Aug 31, 2011 ", 11:33 PM,

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"Our primavera have been in action in the Tirreno e Sport Tournament, starting out with an exciting 3-3 draw with Lazio…

The Primavera began their ‘Tirreno e Sport’ campaign in spectacular fashion. Marco Baroni’s young Bianconeri clinched a draw against Lazio in yesterday’s thrilling 3-3 encounter.There will be an element of regret for the Primavera, who led right up until added time and enjoyed a numerical advantage after two Lazio players were given their marching orders in the second half.The match got off to a flyer, with three goals in the first 16 minutes. De Silvestro put the Bianconeri ahead, before a quick-fire Lazio response. Two goals in a minute, from Orazi and Crescenzi, saw the Biancazzurri turn the game upside down. But Baroni’s men refused to give in, Ruggerio’s strike bringing Juventus level before half-time.
The break did not bring an end to the excitement. Juve kept pushing forward and only the heroics of opposing goalkeeper Berardi kept the young Bianconeri at bay. Lazio were now down to nine, after red cards were issued to both Ilari and Fagioli, and Juventus attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage. Beltrame found the target, making it 3-2 with only a few minutes to play. Unfortunately there was a cruel twist in the tale for Baroni’s side, as Vivaqua popped up in the last minute to give both sides a point apiece.

FLORENCE, September 1, 2011 – The last bang for Juventus does not arrive. It was expected a central defender. Skiped the exchange Bonucci-Bruno Alves, other central
defenders were only a shadow. “There were no immediate opportunities for Juventus,” says Marotta. Lugano has been dropped because he wasn't liked by Conte, Alex did not give sufficient guarantees in this part of the season, ""so we preferred to stay with our champions: Chiellini, Bonucci, Barzagli and Sorensen give us reliance , both qualitatively and
numerically. We don't have european cups …"".

Rhodolfo in January. The operation Bonucci-Alves has stalled in the face of the bids by
Zenit deemed inadequate by the national team defender. The two clubs had agreed instead to an equal exchange. In the hours immediately following the stop with the Russians, Marotta and Paratici have also reasoned, however, whether to numerically strengthen the department. They then screened the applications of Gastaldello, Bocchetti and Andreolli,
without finding a satisfactory solution. The objective was to dry for a loan. Zero disbursement short, because in January, Juventus will return to Bruno Alves and almost certainly end up with the transfer of Rhodolfo. The strengthening plan it is postponed for another 4 months .

Should he go instead or remain with his family. I see that situation time and again with people in different situations.

Stealing is when you take something away from someone who doesn't want to give it to you right?. Somewhere in Italy, there is a contract saying that Juventus F.C. is willing to give Amauri 4m a season and signed by some club official. I don't like it either but they are under contract. Sometimes it sucks for players that really want to leave and the club forces them to stay and sometimes it sucks for clubs. That is the reality of the sport.

Economically rescinding his contracts makes little sense. Amauri is worth about 5m in our books and has an ~4m salary. We would have to pay his salary and loose the cost of his contract, so there will be a loss of 9m in our books. By keeping here for a year the loss is only his salary (4m), provided we can't send him somewhere in January. As for Iaquinta, I don't know his market value but his salary is 2.5m, and he has two years left, so we would have to write him a 5m cheque in 2011. In total we are talking about a 14m loss by cutting their contracts (add the cost of Iaquinta in our books to that). That move will send us deeper into the red.

I know you are very passionate but I think you should put yourself in their shoes. They are not stealing, they are making a perfectly legal decision. I don't share it, but I don't know his personal situation to be judging either.",JoseR ,"Sep 1, 2011 ", 12:28 PM,
The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"I think the example thing refers to training with the group which is the whole problem with the strike. The clubs (and Beppe) argue that if a player is not wanted then he can be forced to train outside of the group while the players argue that they should be allowed to train with the group. Amauri will be an example of the club tried to give him a way out but he wouldn't accept, therefore the roster is too large and why should Amauri be taking time away from Vidal, Elia, or Estigarribia who are actually in the coach's plans.

I heard there is another issue regarding the strike in which if the player is offered a similar contract to what he has by other club, then the player must accept the new contract and go wherever the new club is. One sports commentator said that is the dumbest rule because any player can overturn that by taking the club to court. Any court in Europe will find it illegal to force a person to move across the world, no matter if the terms are the same. What about the opposite, what if Bayern Munich comes to Vidal and gives him a similar contract and us 10.5m and takes the Chilean. The deal is done with 3 parties and should be undone by 3 parties only.

I think this is what he meant about making Amauri an example. I agree with the players having to train separately (they willingly chose that).

Perché in questo caso Amauri ha un contratto netto di 3,8 milioni di euro e gli erano stati garantiti per l'incentivazione all'esodo 3,2 milioni lordi da parte della Juventus. Il Marsiglia gli garantiva 2,5 netti e gli dava un contratto di ulteriori due anni, quindi un totale tre anni. Davanti a una situazione del genere bisogna fare una riflessione, se no le società rischiano di rimanere ingabbiati. Se lo porterò come esempio? È un caso che deve essere preso come esempio”.",jorid22 ,"Sep 1, 2011 ", 2:16 PM,

Juve's general manager took a harder line towards Amauri: “It's the sort
of situation we should reflect upon when discussing the renewal of the
collective agreement with the players' association (AIC). He has a
contract worth €3.8 million net per season and Marseille offered to
extend that contract by a year, with Juventus making a contribution
towards his salary, but the player refused.” Marotta doesn't feel there
have been too many arrivals when compared to the number of signings made
by some of the other clubs: “I think Napoli, who finished fourth last
year, have brought in 12 new players. We thought it was right to satisfy
the requirements of the new coach.”

All I am saying is that I don't know what Amauri's situation is, so I can't judge. Do I want him out, yes, of course. Should he accept a contract different to what he has just because we want him to, or because he won't play a single minute. No. Juventus as a club chose to give him that salary and contract so we need to deal with it.

Paris is a wonderful city, it is not like the offer was in Siberia. The fact remains, he has the right to choose for himself and those he cares about (clearly not Juve).

Amauri will be gone next summer for sure, his contract is up then. What's the massive difference from moving next year instead of this year while making even more money (at OM)? He will eventually have to re-locate anyways and if anything, his kids (apparently 8 and 5) would probably be better off moving/changing schools etc when they are younger than when they are older, no? Also, had Amauri accepted a new destination this year, he would have had an additional year to get used to his new reality and would have avoided losing even more time in a career that seems closer and closer to being finished for him.

To me, with Ziegler gone, we are at the mercy of fate. If De Ceglie suffers an injury like the one he picked up against Milan last year (for which he was at first expected to only miss 1.5-2 months), any shred of hope to get third will vanish. Idem for Lichtsteiner.

Sometimes finding a logic to everything is wrong. The need to understand is little set aside, relying to the cycle of events and slow passage of events. But sometimes the need to understand is more than anything. The market led by Marotta must be understood, otherwise you risk going mad. We met in early August with the sole aim to deliver to Antonio
Conte a central defender and a left winger. May Have been the newspapers, have been unnecessaryru mors , but the confusion that has been generated is indescribable.

The names were many, perhaps too many, too much improvisation and conducted negotiations in jeopardy.Yet he seemed to be started on the right foot. Vucinic, Vidal,

I'm not paraphrasing per se, but this is what he meant : “Juventus is NOT better than Hamburg”

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"What made me very upset last night is when I wrote out our
probable starting lineup for this year:



Elia Matri Vucini Krasic


Vidal Pirlo


PDC Chiel Bon Lictsteiner


Buffon

Realized how much we spent to get that line up (over the
past few years) and then thought about the type of lineup we could have had if
we had hired a coach who could have used the resources we already had instead
of implementing his own vision which in the last two years has included buying
a bunch of different players in each of the last two summers.

This is the lineup I came up with… Which one looks better to
you?

Matri


Gio Diego Krasic

Melo Vidal


Caceres Cheillini Bon Lictsteiner


Buffon

With the second line up we wouldn’t have lost $ on Diego,
Gio would be free (Pasquato could back him and maybe Krasic up), would still be
using Melo (who I thought we excellent for us last year), over paid for
Caceres, but he would have been worth it IMO, Marchisio could rotate in, PDC
could back up Caceres/ sub in for Gio in the last few minutes of a game we’re
trying to close out, for the other positions let youth backup to spur on the
youth movement that many of us have wished for in the last few years…

To me the 2d line up is stronger, and doesn’t have us
spending >$80 mill this year (it
would have been more like $35mill give or take) + all of the $ we spent last
summer. Many of the decisions we have
made have left me scratching my head. Opinions?",tortbort ,"Sep 2, 2011 ", 12:35 PM,

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"If you count the cost over the two years that GDN, Conte and Marotta have been around here is what I came up with:

In the first line-up the “new players” will be:
Bonucci 15m
Lichsteiner 10m
Vidal 10m
Pirlo 0m
Elia 10m
Matri 15m
Vucinic 15m
Krasic 15m

Total = 90m

In the second line-up the “new players” will be:
Caceres 8m
Bonucci 15m
Lichsteiner 10m
Vidal 10m
Krasic 15m
Matri 15 m

Total = 73m

The difference between the 2 economically is Diego's sale, he can finance Vucinic while Caceres + Melo's loan almost get you Elia. I think overall the change needed was massive, and the cost to fix the team was going to be well over 100m to get us at a point where we can build something meaningful (once you count substitutes). I don't think cost wise either line-up is really better.

As a team, I take the first one. The second line-up is very good, however, Diego flopped hard when he
came and he had some market value, Giovinco could not stay here for one
more year without assurances that Juve can't provide, and Caceres was
too expensive for us at the time. I think all three sales are
justified. Having Pasquato for a full season as the only substitute when he had played only 17 matches with Triestina scoring one goal would be hard to imagine. In retrospect I think Pasquato is better than Giovinco, but why stunt his potential if he had any?. Agree on Caceres, he would have been sweet, at 8m the operation was just never going to happen.",JoseR ,"Sep 2, 2011 ", 1:00 PM,

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"With the poor management, that kind of investment was not a choice, it was necessary. We could have saved a few millions keeping Diego (who is now in his 3rd club in 3 years), and Giovinco who may turn to be Juve quality but the other changes were necessary.

We needed players in central defense and we brought three for 16m (Bonucci, Sorennsen, and Barzagli). We needed fullbacks (Zebina and Grosso were our previous starters) and he brought us Lichsteiner and Ziegler (who unfortunately will leave soon) for 10m.

With Poulsen, Sissoko, Marchisio, and Melo, the first two had to go. Marchisio and Melo could have stayed if you want to cut on costs (bringing in Vidal and Pirlo for 10m that is a cost I can accept).

If Giovinco was staying he would have needed a substitute (and a bad one because he wanted to start every game, Giaccherini would have been too good for Giovinco given that they had very similar records last season). Diego also would have needed a sub which would have cost us money and I am guessing we waned a 4-2-3-1 so we needed two RW at least (Pepe and Krasic anyone?). If we are doing the 4-3-1-2, the Giovinco is gone as he couldn't compete with Diego, this again means one more trequartista. We also needed another CM in that case (Pirlo for free would have been great).

Then depending on the line-up we needed a prima punta or a prima punta and seconda punta and their substitutes. Matri, Vucinic, Toni, and Quags fit the bill to an extent.

150m is a huge amount of money, but Secco misplaced his resources incredibly. I am not saying Marotta is the best DS ever, but I think this investment would not have been needed if we had him after Calciopoli instead of Secco.",JoseR ,"Sep 2, 2011 ", 1:25 PM,

The Juve of Antonio Conte has been completed.
We analyze the technical and tactical perspective of the team made available to the coach. The premise of this article is I am not going to play to make the “Little Sport Director”, supposing perhaps what might have been and however it was not: the strategic and economic variables that underlie the success or failure of the buy / sale of a player are mostly unknown (at least to me) and therefore am not able to express opinions fully supported by facts.

As I sit here, listening to Crosby, Stills and Nash crooning over

reasonable explanation to the Ziegler conundrum.

Since 2006, and the shitstorm that arrived and is only now, showing
tentative signs of moving on to other pastures, we have been properly
fucked for fullbacks. Molinaro? Could tackle, but his distribution of
the ball was equal to that of Momo Sissoko. Criscito? Punished too

I agree on the fact that Ziegler is not a superb defender, but the other option that we have now on the left is Grosso (if PDC is injured). Does he rate Grosso higher than Ziegler defensively? Or was this a question of getting rid of Ziegler or Grosso, except Ziegler has market value while Grosso doesn't so they kept the Italian.

If he really wants strong defenders on the flanks, will he play Chiellini there? What does that mean for CB: Lichsteiner-Bonucci-Barzagli-Chiellini?

Too many questions for a backline that already was questionable. I hope Marotta is working hard already to secure some replacements in early January.

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"I am still scratching my head about the Ziegler situation. I think the plan was to keep him around until January at least. When an offer came at the end of the market the cat came out of the bag and the management went into damage control. It was clear that Juve considered the deal because Conte didn't want Reto. Keeping a disgruntled player that made Conte and Marotta look like fools in public was not going to happen. If Conte didn't rate Ziegler as a defender, after Reto went public, I don't think Conte liked him as a locker room player. And so the deal was struck but so late there was no chance to bring a new player. Also, I don't think there was a budget to bring a new LW when we were still searching for a CB.

Conte resembles Capello or Van Gaal in terms of locker room discipline. Those guys will never bow to a player or change their approach because anyone says so. He clearly is establishing himself as the most powerful figure in the dressing room and to a degree in the club as a whole. He dictated Marotta's every move (including Ziegler) which I think is a great way to manage the team. Also, like Capello or Van Gaal, he will die with his tactical ideas. He took a team suited to a 4-3-3 and brought enough players to interpret his favoured 4-4-2. I really hope Conte can be as successful as the other two.",JoseR ,"Sep 3, 2011 ", 3:37 PM,

The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"While we are talking about what it takes to win:
____________
Sir Alex Ferguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986… he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up
the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second
from bottom) when he took over.

In the 1987-88 season, Ferguson made several major signings… The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool.

United were expected to do well…, but the 1988-89 season was a disappointment for them, finishing eleventh in the league and
losing 1–0 at home to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Sixth Round.
_____________

I can continue, but the point is he doesn't win his first league title until the 92-93 season (that is 7 years after he was appointed).

The guy is a winner, I don't know if I would describe him as bitchy, but he is certainly aggressive and disciplinarian. Does he cause harm in the locker room?? You bet, Beckham left because of him. Yet he gets trophies.

I think, what makes a coach successful goes well beyond whether they send a player packing or not. Or whether they are a former player or not. There are plenty of examples of gambles that paid off and many other that didn't. At this point, I rather put my money in a coach that has been at Juve and knows what it means to face the fans after a defeat, than a coach that has consistently proven that he can get us anywhere between 5th and 10th in the league.",JoseR ,"Sep 3, 2011 ", 11:30 PM,
The Roller Coaster Ride of Signing Eljero Elia,ivoandov,"Aug 30, 2011, 11:50am PDT",,"Delio Rossi is a good coach but he is more of the same that you can find in Serie A. He took Palermo to where the team deserved to go. I personally think Delneri took Sampdoria farther than their abilities, and so did Conte with Siena (I don't really know how good the Bari squad was).

The problem with Delneri was not that he isn't a capable coach, we all thought he was good enough to take us to 4th place this season. The problem with him is that he set-up the team to not loose. Most teams that play Juve are also playing not to loose, which means at the end of the day a draw for both parties is a good deal. Sometimes the other team got lucky and scored on us, and that eroded our self-believe… end result: 7th place.

Conte so far appears like a coach that will set up Juve to win. Which makes more sense if the other team is set up to tie. Ideally, at the end of the day we will either tie (if the other club gets their way) or we will win (if we get our way). I know it is not this simple, but mentality has a lot to do in a match. Also, all the players that come to Juve want to be protagonists, when you ask them to sit back and defend I think it has to affect something.

I don't think Conte will get us the scudetto this year and the CL next year. But I think he is a move in the right direction. He is different than Ferrara both in terms of experience and in terms of personality (Ferrara accepted Melo even though that is not what he wanted, Conte sent Ziegler packing). He is also different than Ranieri, and Delneri in terms of mentality (Marchisio as a LW vs. Elia as a LW). He will set up his teams to win, and that is not more of the same that you can find in Serie A.",JoseR ,"Sep 3, 2011 ", 11:10 PM,

It seems like we are trying to run a corporation. However, considering how in the past, many players have unachieved their true footballing potential at Juve, it's really not a suprise. First off, loan with the option to buy, leaves us with an out if a player doesn't come good. In this case, the player knows they must do very good if they want us to sign them.

It was common for us in the Secco era, to pay out big wages for promising players who never came good. In this case, Marotta is the Anti-Secco. At this very time in our history, in terms of performance, we're not a top club. I'm starting to get Marotta's strategy when saying we will sign a few champions, he was floating the idea out there with the hope that some of the big name players would bite. Juve is Juve but players have to think about what is best for their careers, albeit in this case, most of them are short sighted and will pick the fastest path to a big contract with a big club. In a way, I don't blame them. Let's face it, Aguero and Rossi were never gonna come this summer. We've also splashed the cash with Secco and didn't get the value in players we believed were good. Lets face it, Poulson is no Alonso but we thought he'd be a very good player. Marotta wanted the right players but we don't have the allure of a top club anymore.

While a revolving door of players does not build a great comradery or history, it seems to be in place so that we have options and players perform. The club seems like they want to have as many options as possible in order to find a stable group.

My only concern is for the Ziegler and Bonucci incidents. They aren't making any sense to me. Time will tell what that is about. I can only guess that Conte had a disagreeent with Ziegler and decided he wanted him out. Bonucci has shown lack of concentration and since he has openly stated that he loves Juve, and didn't want to leave, there have been no more transfer talks.

If we were not going to be able to bring to players, then competition maybe the most reliable way to squeeze good performances out of players.

Buffon, Lichsteiner, Pirlo, and Matri are sure starters. If Conte indeed had an issue with Ziegler, then PDC is another sure starter. As things stand, Chiellini, Bonucci and Barzagli are going to challenge for the two spots (if Chiellini is in form he will take one for sure). Vidal, Marchisio should be fighting for the other CM starting shirt. Krasic, Giaccherini and maybe Elia will challenge each other for the RW, although Elia will probably start on the LW with Estigarribia and maybe Pasquato challenging him for a starting shirt. Up-front Vucinic and Quags will have to duke it out for the seconda punta spot.

I just really hope Conte plays the players in best form, we don't have a Ribery or a Robben that will demand a starting spot, and although a player of that caliber will be remarkably useful, the current situation is as good as it will get for the next year.

Conte has in his hands a good squad, maybe Marotta didn't answer all of the coach's requests but he clearly addressed most. Now Conte just needs to work with what he has and make the best out of it.

Juventus and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has revealed his frustration over the strike that has delayed the start of the Serie A season.

A breakdown between players and Italian football authorities in finalising a new collective bargaining agreement is the cause of the strike.

Although 33-year-old Buffon admits neither group is to blame for the impasse, he believes both parties need to show some common sense to resolve the dispute.

“I think there isn't just one person responsible, we are all guilty because it has been a defeat for everyone,” Buffon said.

“Having said that, it's also true that with a little bit of common sense and collaboration we probably would have managed to find an agreement, sign it and play the season's first match.”

Buffon said that he and the rest of his team-mates are anxious to get the season underway, and revealed he thinks there are higher powers at work behind the deadlock.

“We really want to sign the agreement as soon as possible,” he said. “We had already reached an agreement several months ago and now, unbelievably, a U-turn has been done on the decision made.”

“This U-turn makes us think a lot of things. First of all, with all the problems we have in Italy – reformations, political problems and so on – I think there was a wish to distract people and give football and the player's too many responsibilities.”

“If a country such as Italy is making such a big fuss over football, it means it isn't a country with a very bright future.”

Gone in 24 hours

Alex looks set to complete his move to Juventus ahead of transfer deadline day which is tomorrow evening.
The Brazil centre-back is desperate to leave west London as he is no longer in Andre Villas-Boas's long-term plans and sees a move to Italy as a surefire way to restart his international career.
Alex has played 111 games for the Blues following his signing in 2007 after a loan spell in Holland with PSV.
He scored 10 goals for the Blues – many long-range bullet free-kicks.
But the signing on international team mate David Luiz effectively has ended his SW6 career.

First time posting but have been a reader for awhile.

Seeing a lot of negativity in regards to this signing and I'm not really understanding where it comes from. Martinez cost us $12 million. Elia will NOT be worse then him. I've watched this kid plenty of times and he brings an element that we haven't had on the left side in years. He's fast as hell and tricky. I don't think I've ever seen Martinez or Pepe trick their defender or beat them with pace. With PDC overlapping him our left side could be very dangerous this season. I'm looking forward to it.

I have to say, I was VERY skeptical of Marotta, but this mercado, dare I say, was brilliant. We've all of a sudden got arguably the best central midfielders in Serie A with Pirlo and Vidal, and now potentially the two most explosive wingers.

As for our CB's – I'm ok with keeping bonucci in the starting spot. Since Zambrotta left out problem has been fullbacks. Now that we have good ones, hopefully he's less exposed in the center.

As much as I want the season to start, this strike gives conte some time to turn these guys into a team. Let's hope for the best.",Timc0014 ,"Sep 1, 2011 ", 2:20 AM,

There is no other rational way to explain why would Marotta be selling depth in a position which has killed us in the last two seasons. It is rumored that if Ziegler leaves, Grosso will come back to the squad and Chiellini would be the third alternative (given the other CB we buy adapts to the league). We all saw how Grosso was last year, no thanks. Add to that, the fact that so many players get injured at Juve we may be back to a Motta-Bonucci-Chiellini-Grosso line-up by December. Really??? No thanks.

I trust Conte and Marotta know what they are doing but if this move comes to be it will be truly disheartening. Even if Perotti, or Afellay come, they will help us little if PDC has a long term injury. Heck, even if Messi came, he would help us little with Grosso covering his back (we all know how it goes when Messi plays with a lousy defense).

The other one is the Elia move, I hear wonderful stories about the kid, how good he is, how fast he is, and all of that. The kid has attitude problems which we don't need right now, and if he was that good then why does Afellay start over him in the national team? Maybe age, who knows. I am just not that convinced about him. I would keep Ziegler, I would keep our wingers and bring this Rhodolfo guy who at least looks half decent. That, in it of itself, looks better than Grosso (a lousy fullback) and Perotti (a promising, yet unproven youngster).",JoseR ,"Aug 28, 2011 ", 7:27 PM,

Open Thread: The Game That Isn't,johncas,"Aug 28, 2011, 10:17am PDT",,"So now the Turkish newspapers are confirming the Ziegler transfer, with some details (3 year contract accepted, etc).

If these news are correct, dear friends, please enlighten my confused 37-year-old brain:

1) First we declared we'd get a few champions, not go for depth. This proved to be false as we all know, and discussed at length here, down to the reasons, and how we didn't believe it in the first place, etc. Ok.

2) Then, we made a mix of decent to very good transfers, adding plenty of depth in some positions, while we still needed others in key positions.

3) Ziegler was almost unanimously hailed here as a “good but not great” transfer, who would offer good competition and cover for De Ceglie. I agreed with this.

4) Now, like a Canal Street character selling fake Rolexes, we spin him off for what would appear to be a good profit before he's had a single official game under the Juve shirt.

5) Unless Marotta gets someone for that position out of his hat right now, we're down to De Ceglie and Grosso. The same exact duo we had last season.

So we don't get depth, either.

“If Marotta was,”



Alexander the Great, he would sell Macedonia and Greece to the Persians
in return for the oilfields of Mesopotamia (long-term investment, see).

Constantine the Great, he would sell the peninsula on which Constantinople would be founded (and stood unconquered for almost a thousand years) for a good profit, and rent the Siberian taiga (boreal forests in Siberia) with the right to buy after 120 years.

Lorenzo de Medici, he would not support Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo but commission their least-known students for half the price, giving us diminutive sized replicas of the Duomo and the Sistine Chapel, covered with cartoons inside, and claim they did the job just as well (he wasn't involved, but I couldn't resist).

So far he has gotten rid of a bunch of Secco's mistakes (although there is much work to be done still). Iaquinta seems to be on his way out and I think Amauri will not be with us by September 1st (even on a loan deal with Parma).

On top of that he has brought Bonucci, which most people don't want to loose so he must be half decent at least. Sorensen, for 150k. Lichsteiner, one of the best fullbacks in Serie A. Ziegler (who may be leaving with a surplus of 4m for the club). Krasic who was wanted by Man City and who lit the Serie A on fire last fall (at least for a few months). Vidal, wanted by Bayern Munich, so probably not that bad. Pirlo, one of the best playmakers in the world. Estigarribia, a promising player for 500k. Giaccherini, another promising Italian. Vucinic, a great player when on form. Quagliarella, our best player until that freak injury. Matri, one of the best strikers in Serie A at the time. That is to name some.

I purposely omitted Martinez, as I see him as one of Marotta's biggest mistakes. There is also Motta but with the budget of last year, it was either him or nothing.

Marotta has built a decent team in the last two years. Last year we bought many players who will be backups and this year we improved the squad (please disagree with me if you feel I am wrong). Lichsteiner, Krasic, Vidal, Pirlo will be starters in all Serie A teams (Krasic maybe not if the team doesn't play wingers but you get my point). Bonucci will also probably start for most teams along with Giaccherini, and Vucinic although their quality is more for debate than the others.

Do you really think Marotta should have gone and spent 45m on Aguero??, if so, who would be playing instead of Vucinic, Matri, Lichsteiner and Giaccherini (their total value comes close to the 45m of Aguero). How do we go about convincing Sanchez to join Juve when the other club making an offer is the strongest team in the world right now? Or let me ask you this, who would have joined Barca in 2002 if Juve came knocking? My answer is nobody. So what did they do?, they built the team from the ground up, bringing players like Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Pedro, Alcantara, from their youth ranks. That is what the Appelt brothers are here for, same with Sorensen, and hopefully others which we don't know yet.

The team needs to get used to do a market that follows FFP rules and we are doing so. Beppe also has had more time to plan the mercatto this year. Next year, hopefully we are in CL and more importantly, hopefully we have the same coach. If those two come to be, then expect a more moderate mercatto more to the usual standards. And then, maybe then it will be reasonable to demand Marotta brings an Aguero type player to Turin.",JoseR ,"Aug 29, 2011 ", 3:13 AM,

Here's the news about Ziegler, where the president of Trabzonspor declares it's done.

==
Ziegler bitti

Trabzonspor, Juventus'un İsviçreli sol kanat oyuncusu Reto Ziegler'i de aldı. 3 yıllık anlaşılan futbolcunun, bugün ya da yarın Trabzon'a gelmesi bekleniyor.

Şampiyonlar Ligi için kadrosunu kaliteli isimlerle güçlendirmek isteyen Trabzonspor, bir süredir gündeminde olan İsviçreli 25 yaşındaki sol kanat oyuncusu Reto Ziegler ile 3 yıllığına anlaşmaya vardı. Başkan Sadri Şener ve yönetim kurulu üyesi Tuncay Bekiroğlu'nun yakından takip ettiği transfer görüşmeleri sonucunda ilk olarak Juventus kulübü, yeni transfer ettiği Ziegler'i satmaya ikna edildi. Ardından da oyuncuyla yapılan görüşmelerde önemli aşama kaydedildi. Akşam saatlerinde Ziegler'e gönderilen sözleşme futbolcunun avukatları tarafından detaylı bir şekilde incelendi ve son karar verildi.



ŞENER: HAYIRLI OLSUN

Avukatlarının sözleşmeyi incelemesinden ve olumlu referans vermesinden sonra bordomavili takımın 3 yıllık sözleşme teklifini kabul eden Ziegler, bugün ya da yarın Trabzon'a gelecek.
Bu arada Juventus, Reto Ziegler'i yaklaşık bir ay önce Sampdoria'dan
bedelsiz olarak kadrosuna katmıştı. Trabzonspor Başkanı Sadri Şener de
Ziegler'in tüm camiaya hayırlı olmasını dileyerek, “Çok önemli bir oyuncuyu kadromuza kattık. Transfer çalışmalarımız sürüyor” dedi.

To summarize, it says they're expecting Ziegler in Trabzon tomorrow, and that the president Sadri Sener said “In Ziegler we've added a very important player to our squad. Our transfer activities will continue.”",juvealways ,"Aug 29, 2011 ", 4:11 AM,

Lets look at the major movers of the Summer so far.
Nasri…left a solid premiership team (yesterday aside!), for a team who paid him much more than Arsenal, offered definite CL football, much greater chance of winning the domestic title, and also a much stronger team to play within.
Sticking with Arsenal, Clichy also had the same incentives.
Had Fabregas not been a Barca boy, still…by this summer I feel he would have moved on, for similar reasons to the above. the other thing with fabgregas is that he wants to be winning, not simply playing pretty, entertaining football.

Aguero- those very factors mentioned hugely influenced his decision. I do not criticize him at all for choosing City, for he has no special connection to us.

Ashley Young- Similar reasons. more $, CL, Title fight, better team.

Mata- more $, better team, better chance of winning titles.

Eto'o- more $

Lukaku, De Gea, Alexis Sanchez,Coentrao, Sahin…all headed to better clubs with better prospects, and better squads, and all in the CL.

Pastore's move falls into the same category of that of Eto.

All of the above players have gone to more attractive clubs than Juventus. I mean more attractive financially, competitively and technically.

Perhaps we could have afforded Mata's or Young's or Lukaku's wages..but why the hell would they have chosen us over the teams they chose? It would make no sense whatsoever.

Also, I cannot believe for a second that we had/have as a club, NOT as the prime shareholder EXOR, the financial muscle to seriously compete with chelsea, man united, Madrid, Barca, PSG, fucking Anzi! Do you know the wages of those mentioned in this post? Perhaps Ashley Young, Lukaku and De Gea will seem on not crazy wages, but they moved to the respective clubs for other factors, not just Money, other factors than again, are more attractive there than presently in turin.

Open Thread: The Game That Isn't,johncas,"Aug 28, 2011, 10:17am PDT",,"Ok, I meant limited arguments, as in, they can be used to explain a few things to some extent, but run out of steam in the big picture.

So as you've pointed out, of course some of these players would've been way too expensive (and even if we could have afforded them, it would be crazy money for one player when there were so many gaps in the squad), and “some” of them might be more attracted to immediate promise of success.

However; not all players are mercenaries, and not all players look at the here and now in terms of hopes of success. Are you telling me that none of the players above would've considered Juve if money was out of the equation, just because we aren't in the CL this season? So, the competition/success argument, as I said, is limited.

Now, some of the players in that list indeed do get maniacal amounts, but not all of them, as you've observed. If Marotta had kept to his word of 2-3 champions, I have no doubt in my mind that we could have afforded them, and that there would be some players of that caliber willing to come to us.

Which would leave us with precious little money to fill in the gaps in the squad, right? Well, we already filled most of them with cheap or free transfers to begin with (and kudos to Marotta for that)! The whole point of buying on the cheap to fill in gaps and create sufficient depth in the squad is to have the capital to spend on a few big transfers, isn't it?",juvealways ,"Aug 29, 2011 ", 4:02 AM,

Open Thread: The Game That Isn't,johncas,"Aug 28, 2011, 10:17am PDT",,"-Iaquinta leaving? To where? Since when?

-Ziegler leaving is fucking pointless. Don't give me the 4 million surplus spiel, fuck that shit. The whole idea of selling the player a month after he was bought without him even making an appearance for the club reeks of short-sightedness and having no coherence from one month to the next. Actually, you know what? Fine, I'm down with Ziegler being sold for 4 million Euros. We need an experienced leader CB (something which Rhodolfo is not, no matter how promising at barely 25 he might seem) still and with that money we can match Lugano's Fenerbahce minimum fee release clause, no? Wouldn't that be a good deal? It would make sense, right? Ah shit, nevermind.
-Giaccherini is still promising at 26? Awesome, that means that I still have a chance to make it in football as well, I'm only 20 after all. Nothing against Giaccherini the player, the deal for him is alright but promising player? Eh, he'll be a pretty useful addition, that's about it.

-Vucinic great when in form? Disagree, he's a very good player when in form, mediocre when not in form. Very good=/=great in my book. Aguero=great, Vucinic=very good.

-I'm a huge believer in giving young players a chance, while trying to remain rational when judging Juve's youth instead of making them all seem like superstars in the making. With that out of the way, I find the incessant Barcelona comparisons you'll see being made about other clubs these days nothing short of cancerous. Ciro Ferrara is a young coach who was a former star and has been put in charge of a big club? Ooooh, Pep Guardiola started the same way, look where he is now!!! Luis Enrique is coming to Roma? He will instill the Barcelona mentality and play beautiful football!!! Conte likes playing very aggressive attacking football? The new Juventus will resemble Barcelona!!! Borussia winning the Bundesliga? Aha, they followed the Barcelona model and invested resources on their youth!!! Investments being made in the youth system? Good, we are trying to make our own cantera like Barcelona!!! One day we will hopefully dominate the world with Immobile, Ekdal, Appelt, Sorensen and Branescu just like Barcelona with Messi, Xavi, Pedro, Puyol and Iniesta!!!

The dream of succeeding with youth products is neat and all but when even your best youngsters are constantly considered small cash-out opportunities and keep on getting sent out on loan after loan after loan after co-ownership, well, that dream goes to shit. Ekdal isn't lighting the Serie A on fire but he seems to have the necessary potential to become a good player. Not great, but probably a good Serie A central midfielder. Anybody willing to bet where his next co-ownership will be? I'm putting 10 on Genoa for 1.8 million Euros, it's the last blue and red mid-table Serie A club left he hasn't been farmed out to yet.

So how about Iago who did great in the Viareggio Tournament and wasn't given a single chance with the first team. And that's not that bad, I suppose. He was very young at the time and needed regular playing time, hence why we sent him to play with Bari's high school kids!!! He certainly doesn't look to be Andres Iniesta's heir but he looks like he's got decent potential, his Liga Adelante experience wasn't exactly terrible. Which European dark horse will he be loaned out to in the summer of '12 on a free loan with a sub-2 million purchase option? I got 5 on Marseille, he still hasn't tried out France and the Ligue 1 yet.

How about Gabriel Appelt gets some first team minutes this year instead of rotting in the Primavera when he played nearly a full season in the main Brazilian division last year?

-FFP? A farcical movement which at best will chop off the legs of smaller clubs looking to increase in stature 'too fast'. Big clubs like Barcelona, Real and Man United will continue to loan from banks and make it rain on whoever they feel like, whenever they feel like, without giving a single flying fuck. Can you imagine Platini and friends putting a halt on their carelessness and punishing Barcelona or Real by not allowing them to partake in the C.L? I can't either, the Champions League, together with Uefa would fall off the face of the Earth. And it's great that we're going for a self-sustaining Juventus, it really is, no dollar store sarcasm here. I never thought the Aguero rumors were realistic, nor did I believe it would have been wise spending dozens of millions on him in transfer and salary fees. But we've been saying “Patience, this will be a difficult year and we can't allow ourselves to compete with Barcelona & co in such bidding wars for a particular player, we have other issues to resolve at the moment” for how many years now? I mean, the phrase itself does make some sense but we are going to continue saying that for how many more years? Can I get a timeframe here? I figured last season was the one we were supposed to finally qualify for the C.L and this summer was going to be the mercato characterized by us “adding few quality additions to the previously created 'zoccolo duro' [Marotta's phrase meaning something like 'strong backbone']” and we have already brought in 8 players, possibly 10 by Wednesday. Where's the 'zoccolo duro' at? At Cesena with Martinez? At Zenit with Pepe and Bonucci?

I am willing to be as patient as necessary since after all, I can't really do much more other than follow and cheer regardless as a fan. But I want to see some relation and coherence between seasons and years and that's not very present here. Every season, we start from scratch with a new plan believing that it will finally be the one to get us in Europe etc. Every season, the 'reset' button is pressed. If the 2011-2012 season will prove to be another failure, any remaining doubt about us having become pre-Calciopoli * will vanish.

Operation altogether advantageous for the Bianconeri, who will gain and turn immediately to cash-in on the latest cool objectives of this market. Green light from Antonio Conte, who at this early stage of the season, has never shown great enthusiasm for the characteristics of the Swiss, almost always preferring De Ceglie.

And if we add the fact that, potentially, from last year, many new implants, they go to fill the role of starters for 6-7 places from 11 than last season, we are in front, of course, to turn the team like a sock.

All right, we can safely say that after the disaster of last year, we definitely wanted to major interventions, but the purpose of beginning of the year, probably before choosing a technician, were certainly not restayling for a complete remodeling.

Juventus'lu Reto Ziegler Trabzonspor'un teklifini reddetti...

Trabzonspor'un, Juventus'un İsviçreli sol bek oyuncusu Reto Ziegler'in transferini gerçekleştiremediği öğrenildi.



Juventus Kulubü ile bonservis konusunda yazışmalarını yaparak anlaşmaya varan, futbolcudan da dün gece sözlü olarak 'evet' yanıtını alan bordo-mavili kulübün, bu transferde futbolcunun daha sonraki tutumu nedeniyle sorun yaşadığı belirtildi.



Ziegler'in Trabzonspor'a gelmek istemediği ve bu nedenle transferin gerçekleşmesinin çok düşük olduğu kaydedildi.



Kulüp asbaşkanı Nevzat Şakar da gelişmeleri doğrulayarak, ''Futbolcu gelmek istemiyor. Bu nedenle transfer gerçekleşemiyor'' dedi. Bordo-mavili kulüp, futbolcuyu almak üzere bu sabah İsviçre'ye özel uçak göndermişti.

==

Here's the most interesting part: ""The bordeaux-blues had agreed on the deal with Juventus, and received a verbal “yes” from Ziegler, but the player's later attitude drove the transfer to a very low probability…. Trabzonspor had sent a private jet to Switzerland this morning to pick Ziegler.""

Who sends a private jet before the signature is on the paper? LOL.

Juve sign Estigarribia on loan
August 29, 2011


Juventus have completed the loan signing of Paraguay international Marcelo Estigarribia from Deportivo Maldonado, the Serie A club confirmed.

GettyImagesMarcelo Estigarribia has moved to Italy

Estigarribia, 24, was Juve's eighth acquisition this summer and can play in left midfield or on the wing – heplayed on loan at Newell's Old Boys last season and impressed at this summer's Copa America.
''I am really excited,'' said Estigarribia. ''This is a dream come true. It is fantastic and also unexpected. I want to enjoy this moment.
''I am very proud to be here at Juventus. It is not every day that you get the chance to play for a big club and now it is up to me to prove that I belong here.''
Juve will have the option to make Estigarribia's move permanent if they pay €5 million at the end of the campaign.",Ricardo ,"Aug 29, 2011 ", 5:18 PM,

the ugly truth is that Juventus is not hanging on to Ziegler! Ziegler declined Trabzon offer.

There are still ~48 hours and if Conte doesn't like him and he will get another offer that he also likes, well it's by bye Ziegler!

Unfortunately if you ask me! This guy is more then usefull when we think about Paolino and Grosso. One has a big problem, coming from an injury and the other one has forgot that we are in 2011 and not 2006.

BTW can anybody answer me to a short question?

My name is Milos Sadzak, born in 1989 in Kragujevac, Serbia. Currently live in Belgrade with my fiancee, who is really jealous at Juve because i spend to many time updating news and chatting with Old Lady fans all over the world. I am working in the T-shirt printing factory in Serbia, where i printed that awesome T-shirt on my avatar. Became Juventus fan in 2000,since i saw Edgar Davids with his cool glasses in Nike commercial “The Mission” (check it out on youtube)i was desperate to see Juventus play, than i fell in love in (guess who) Alex of course. So i am anticipating every match like it's a champions league final, even friendly, since than. I became a goalkeeper because of Gigi, trained for 6 years and than i quit (i was really bad:)). Favorite all time players in this line: Alex, Buffon, Nedved, Davids, Camoranesi, Trezegol, Marchisio & Chiello

About my boy Krasic, really hoping he will succeed with Juve. I am thrilled to see Serbian once again in B&W, and really can't understand people who are saying awful stuff about him. A lot of fans saying he is predictable, easy to mark, just runs straight, poor shot, falls down like a 10 dollar whore… I am watching him since Serbia (& Montenegro) U20, and trust me he is not predictable, and he is really hard to mark. Can do a lot more than just running straight and has amazing long shot, too bad he didn't show that last season. And aside he is Juventino and he was tired and all those bullshit…he was playing his first season in Serie A and was constant threat in or out of form. I am just concerned about those stupid divings, that started last year a bunch of times for Juve and Serbia, hoping he will cut that out. But next season will show if he is a champion or just an average player.

Not much Beppe can do about that…

As to what happened with Rossi? I thought that Villareal closed the door on that one…so who was left to purchase? 15m for Mirko is fine by me. Its not 30-40million, which, as you say, needs to be scrutinized as an investment very carefully before ploughing ahead with such deals.

I think we took a hit on the business side, and we can afford to, in order to greatly improve our front line for the next year or three.

Seriously, I was more excited about Estigarribia and Giaccherini than this guy. If the mighty Hamburg, that finished 8th last season and are sitting in last spot this season, are willing to part ways with a young winger with contract until 2014 for 9m, something in there smells fishy.

Have in mind that Giaccherini can play both wings and apparently so can Elia (albeit he is much stronger on the left). So Pasquato may become a second option rather than a third if that makes any sense.

Someone also wrote here that Conte wanted five wingers. He does demand a lot of them, moving up and down the field incessantly so they may be prone to more injuries or fatigue than other positions. With that being said Krasic is 26, Elia 24, Giacc 26, Estigarribia 24, and Pasquato 22. They are all very young and only competing in Serie A.

I was just saying that to me, 9 million + bonuses for Elia doesn't seem so great. Not a terrible deal but Elia's transfer, judging by his past season and his personality/playing style can go 2 ways and 2 ways only:

-he gets his shit straight at Juve under Conte, learns to not be an idiot and turns out a great pickup
-he is a massive disappointment, resembles Jeremy Menez's equally psychotic Dutch twin brother and is as cancerous as they come

The fact that we're taking so many gambles in a mercato where we were supposed to add few but quality players aggravates the fuck out of me.

Juventus hunting Malouda signatureAugust 25, 2011
Email
PrintBy ESPNsoccernet staff
Chelsea could be willing to sell Florent Malouda to Juventus after the Italian club's general director Giuseppe Marotta declared an interest in the winger.

GettyImagesFlorent Malouda: One year left on contract

Chelsea manager Andres Villas-Boas is eager to sign Alvaro Pereira from former club Porto, according to widespread reports, and is ready to offload Malouda in a cut price £5 million deal to make way for the Uruguay international.
The Guardian claim that Chelsea have already had a £16.6 million opening offer for Pereira rejected and are ready to lodge an improved bid.
Malouda, 31, has a year left on his Chelsea contract and the club's policy of only offering one-year extensions to players over 30 years old means his long-term future at Stamford Bridge is in doubt.
Now Juventus appear to have offered the France international an alternative option with Marotta telling the Italian media: “Unfortunately, Malouda is not ours, but he is certainly an interesting player…”
Juventus reportedly made an approach for Manchester United winger Nani, which was quickly snubbed earlier in the transfer window, and manager Antonio Conte has now turned his attentions to Malouda.
The Italian side also made a move to sign Hamburg SV winger Eljero Elia ealrier this month but the Holland international rejected a move to the Serie A.
However, the Bianconeri are close to completing a deal for Cesena striker Emanuele Giaccherini, who is undergoing a medical in Turin.
The 26-year-old will join in a €3million deal, with Juventus midfielder Jorge Martinez heading in the opposite direction on a season-long loan.
Giaccherini will pen a four-year contract with Juventus and will become the club's ninth signing this summer.

Goal.com Fanview,johncas,"Aug 26, 2011, 7:16am PDT",,"Crazy transfers and rumors going on right now:

- Almiron is gone, no news if we got money for the transfer or if we just save on his salary, one way or another we can close that chapter.

- Even though we signed Giaccherini and the signature of Estigarribia is the only thing missing, Juve are still looking for one more winger, or so the rumors go.

Calcio news sites keep talking about Malouda, Afellay, Farfan, and Elia (no Perotti).

Villas Boas said Malouda is not going anywhere but that may change if Chelsea sign a winger (Alves) from Porto leaving less space for the Frenchman. The issue with this deal is Malouda's salary of over 4m which at 31 is high to say the least (also he probably would want at least a 3 year contract). The other issue is that we have to wait until Chelsea finalize their deal which may not happen until too close to the 31st, who knows.

Afellay looked pretty happy today at the Supercopa and although I would love him in this team I think he doesn't want to leave Spain (foolish boy) for now.

Farfan would also be a sweet player to get. However it all appears to be rumors so far. He is also the oldest at 26 (writing that makes me feel old)

Elia is apparently the most likely of transfers with Grygera going the opposite way and us getting a discount on the Dutchman. Not against him (assuming he didn't say anything about Juve being at the same level of some German club which I don't care to remember). Getting a fast, young winger, check… getting rid of Grygera and his inflated salary, double check.

What is very weird is that we already have Pepe, Krasic, Pasquato, Estigarribia and Giaccherini. That is already one too many. Pasquato has all sorts of market so he would be ok going on loan. But this would mean Pepe has to be on his way out too if we get another winger (I don't see us selling Krasic). Maybe the Zenit rumor is true.

On the same token, is Pasquato really worse than Giaccherini or Estigarribia? He is younger than all of them, has played in Italy unlike the Paraguayan, is a great set piece taker, and most importantly has played with Conte from the beginning (he is also a Juventino for what is worth). I don't know how wise is to loan him out. It is not like we have Nedved and Ribery on our flank.

The other option is we keep Pasquato and sell Pepe. Pasquato and Estigarribia on the left and Krasic and Giaccherini on the right. Giaccherini can apparently play on both sides so he can also become our LW if Estigarribia or Pasquato don't pull their weight. One way or another, getting a starting shirt in MF will be hard next season, I like it.

- Funny rumor. Pasquato may go to Parma!!!. Can you imagine the youngster taking Giovinco's spot? I don't wish ill on Giovinco but it wuold be sad and funny if this happens. I am for keeping the youngster though

- Giandonato may stay with Juve until January (not essential to the club and not good for the kid, I hope it doesn't happen).

- Juve don't want to let Sorensen go (he should stay if Conte plans on playing him or if he sees him as a contender for one of the positions).

- Bruno Alves was referred to as a Portuguese Materazzi… I am with Jorid on this one, let's give Bonucci, Sorensen, and Barzagli a chance before bringing an old Portugal player plying his trade in the most competitive league in the world (that is acoording to Eto'o, just kidding).

- Lugano to PSG and Kjaer to Roma. I wish Juve could have gotten one of these two, specially the Dane, he is young, knows the Serie A and is a beast which can develop even farther. On my books better than Alex and Bruno Alves, and with the right direction, may be better than Lugano.

All the truth about JUVENTUS: THE TRIAL IN NAPLES

This entire section is 'in progress'. The ongoing process held at the IX Criminal Chamber of the Court of Naples is not over yet, at least at the time of this writing. We strongly recommend to all of you to follow the developments and read the sentences: each update will be faithfully
published on the websites that you will find in the 'Links' section.

The ""cupola"" like mafia and P2. On July 10, 2007, the Neapolitan Prosecutors Filippo Beatrice and Giuseppe Narducci requested for remand of 37 out of the 48 suspects (for the others, the Prosecutor’s Office requested for the acquittal due to lack of evidence). After the first ruling (02/10/2008), there were 24 people left indicted (excluding even Ghirelli and Carraro, espectively secretary and president of FIGC). The accusation is of sporting fraud, but for some defendants there also is the crime of conspiracy. The hypothesis is that they would set up an organization (Narducci even say 'with secret purposes', so to be addressed by some journalists as ""mafia- and P2-like"" *a massonic lodge operating illegally in Italy in the ‘70s – ed]), with the former Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi as the main promoter, which de facto ruled he Italian football world and altered the outcome of the matches (prosecutors identified 29 matches in Serie A).(29), (30)

Giraudo and the already vanished offences. On the 14th of December 2009, the first sentences for the suspects who chose the abbreviated procedure were issued. It does not mean plea-bargain, it does not mean confession. The Italian justice system provides, in fact, for the defendant the possibility to avoid the hearing stage of the first instance and defends himself, thanks to his/her lawyers, from the allegations of the prosecutor without being able to rely on witnesses or additional evidence. Former CEO of Juventus Antonio Giraudo was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. Could have the abbreviated trial been a defensive error? A strategy? We only know that it is not over yet. On appeal, in fact, the sentence can be turned over,
in light of the developments lately emerged in the trial. It does not even seem very unlikely, even in virtue of the grounds (apologies for the comment, but they are absurd to say the least) adduced by the Judge De Gregorio. Three are the matches contested:

Goal.com Fanview,johncas,"Aug 26, 2011, 7:16am PDT",,"I was just watching ESPN and according to the interista Gabriele Marcotti( the serie a expert and as fair and balanced as fox news) Arturo Vidal will be the serie a flop of the season because he is a LB or trequartista and Antonio Conte who is a terrible coach wants to use him as the LW this season and Juve is the devil. I would give anything to bump into this guy and shut his mouth once and for all.
(I have been following Arturo for a while ever since i saw him in i think it was under 20 world cup and he was the BOSS of the CM every time i saw him and i always wished that juve would get him. He is versatile and excellent everywhere but he is a true CM all day everyday)

This guy gets to me so much because i live in australia and there is very little coverage of serie a and everytime he is on ESPN he digs the boot in to juve. Im tired of it. The other guys on ESPN like the corrupted andrew orsatti( who is from australia and is a traitor, used to be a well known juventino overe here) dont say anything and people believe this shit. When the serie a preview on ESPN is all that most people over here get their information from, his words are very powerful and damages our reputation even further.

This is not good enough… We are Juventus, one of the grandest and most storied clubs in the world and we should not stand for this shit. I say we bombard and blitzkrieg this guys twitter and any other way you guys know how to get to this guy and let him know that this shit will not be tolerated.

The squad that we have and are likely to have at the end of the mercato i dont believe will be able to interpret the 4 2 4 with success.
I believe that the 4 2 4 needs two quality destroyers in the middle and not a regista. Vidal sissoko would have worked because it looks to me like the midfielders get involved mainly in the second phase of the offence, once the wingers and forwards have the ball and make late runs into the box and form a high barrier so the ball stays in our attacking area.
Conte has been forced to compromise because we have pirlo and i think he is trying to improvise by not having a libero ball playing CB and using pirlo to distribute the ball to the wingers. i dont think it will work, we will be exposed too much through the middle.
I have faith in Conte, and i know he will be given time to return us to where we should be. He will be our coach next year whatever happens. Lets hope he is a good coach and not be too stubborn about the formation.",cheech ,"Aug 27, 2011 ", 1:09 PM,

Goal.com Fanview,johncas,"Aug 26, 2011, 7:16am PDT",,"Rumors for the last day

- Defense: Roma may not buy Kjaer, Juve could pounce on that, however they haven't been too keen on pursuing the Dane so I doubt suddenly Marotta or Conte are going to change their minds.

The Bonucci deal apparently is not as far forward as it appeared. Zenit want Bonucci + money for Bruno Alves, while Juve want Bruno Alves + money for Bonucci. Clearly the difference is pretty large and it appears both Conte and Spalleti are willing to make due with Bonucci and Bruno Alves staying put. I hope this is the case and Bonucci leaves only if we get money + Alves, and I am not talking 0.5m.

Alex wants a four year deal so he is a no go anymore

Lugano is at PSG so that is a no go anymore as well

The latest player we have been linked to is a Brazilian named Rhodolfo. I don't watch the Brazilian league ofter but he is apparently one of the best ones in Brazil. Born in 1986 he is 25 yrs old and Bari was apparently after the defender last season. He will occupy the non-EU place we have left if he were to come. His price is rumored to be between 5 and 7m and Marotta needs to figure out if to make the deal permanent or just a loan. I found a couple videos

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v…

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v…

- Midfield: Malouda started today, the fee + salary is too high so the Frenchman is not going.

Elia played 18 minutes in the last two games. He would come cheaper than Perotti.

Perotti won't come with so few days left in the market. He would also come at 20-25m so you can also say good bye to him.

Farfan has never heard from Juve so you can scratch that one off too.

Barcelona and Afellay would prefer a loan but Marotta would like to buy the player in full so it is also unlikely.

____________________________
Thoughts:

From the Rhodolfo videos it looks like he can play RB so that would be reassuring
as well. Instead of trading Bonucci for an old defender who is mostly a
brute, we can trade Marco Motta, and with the money we receive we can
bring in a promising player that can cover RB and CB. He is also 190 cm
tall (6 ft 3 in) so hopefully he can help with set pieces. I say if we
have the money, make it happen

I still think Afellay is the best for what Conte wants. I can help but think that Marotta may be using Afellay and Elia to attract the best offer. They are both in the Dutch team and obviously the player with the most presences is likely to get a starting shirt. Afellay started 7 games last season with Barca (he came on in January remember), and played as a sub 14 other times, out of which he came on 10 times after 80 minutes of play. If Elia comes and Afellay stays, chances are that Elia will be a starter for the Netherlands next season, if Afellay comes, then Elia will remain a substitute. I hope Marotta is using this to his advantage.",JoseR ,"Aug 27, 2011 ", 7:54 PM,

I truly doubt that u, or anybody else, is following EPL,Russian League, BundesLiga and Turkish League to be able to make a fair comparison.. I haven't seen Bruno Alves, and most probably u as well, to guarantee that his abilities are as they were (which weren't spectacular in the 1st place).. Zenit wants him out after a year after spending 20 mill and willing to replace him with Bonucci is not sounding right.

Lugano is my favourite following him in the Coppa America and World Cup. He is a great leader yet his age as well as the speed (Which Moggi has said last year that to pair with Chellini u have to have a fast defender to catch up with the opponents.) are probably his weakness.. Anyway he is PSG player no need to argue about him anymore.
I watched Kjaer 2 seasons ago he was impressive and i watched him in some Bundesliga games, probably not equally as good as in Serie A but he was good, Better than Bonucci at least who also whored around time after time from less than mediocre attackers in the Serie A.
Everybody is saying give Bonucci a chance, When Bonucci arrived to Juve, Kjaer was better than him. Why are u giving Bonucci a another chance when he messed up his bad (No excuses that the whole team sucked and crap, He sucked he can't handle the pressure he was all over the place, too many mistake come from him, live with it and stop denying it).. Ur gonna waste a year anyway giving Bonucci.. He was good with Italy in the match he had 2 proper fullbacks. So was Grosso in the Roma match lets give him a chance as well!
Alex did a stupid mistake cost the team a goal nobody is moaning about that.. They are probably having there mind on leaving the club and not putting there best performances till the market closes..",Juventusawi ,"Aug 27, 2011 ", 8:20 PM,

- According to footballitalia.net, Elia is expected to fly in to Turin and have his medical on Monday. We did bid for Perotti but Sevilla turned our 14mil offer down. Affelay is another option and he can play on both wings. However, Barca don't intend to sell… so far. Nobody mention Vargas this past week but don't count him out.

Truth to tell, I don't like Elia. He's fast and very skillful allright but I think he also has a bit of Ballotelli's blank brain. And that, you cannot improve. Perotti is also a technical player, albeit not as skillful nor as fast but he's the much more hard worker. And he's ambidexterity. Affelay also has skills and is more versatile than Elia. Vargas? His left leg is much deadlier than Elia's, not to mention he's also a a very good free-kick and corner-kick taker. All can play in a four-man midfield or a three-man attack. Of the four, I rate Elia the lowest.

Furthermore, we've already got El Chelo, a good and young left-footed LW so why go with another good and young left-footed LW? I'd prefer a more established and experienced one, such as Vargas, if you go with occasional brilliance. And occasional facepalm moments along the way. Or Bastos, if you prefer a steadier and more hard worker skillful veteran.

- Rhodolfo, 25, Sao Paolo, is reported to be our Lucio soon (pardon the language). Don't know much about this giant (1.93m) but I thought the whole reason in finding a CB to start in front of Bonucci was leadership. And experience. That's why it's Lugano. That's why it's Alex. And that's why it's Bruno Alves.

Rhodolfo? He might be the next Lucio (again, pardon my language) but he doesn't fall in the “leadership” and “experience” category if you have Chiellini in your team.

You can kill me for saying this but since Lugano has gone to a greener (or frenchier) pasture then I'll be happy with Alex. He's good and since Shane Long doesn't play in Serie A, he should be fine.

If in the end Elia and Rhodolfo do join us, looks like I'll have to start taking my annual medical check-up more seriously. Back-to-back 7th place I can take but missing a CL spot three times in a row? God help us all.",dwicarta ,"Aug 28, 2011 ", 8:06 AM,

I m actually fine with it being borjan type deal since we will have him for 2 years in the mean time we can allow pasquato to mature and if at end he meets the requirement we let barca take back affellay if not we can buy him for the set price. i dont see a problem with it becoz at best rfor 2 years we have a good winger while allowing our youngster to grow and replace him and at worst we fork out more money keep him (which we must do now if we buy him).,SJ_JUVE ,"Aug 28, 2011 ", 12:36 PM,

Jokes aside, I think Elia would be a good capture. I think he has the most potential out of all the wingers you mentioned. The only problem is that he's a man-child (the next Melo?). But, if Conte can guide him well (Conte's a really strict manager), he can be great. But for now, I would prefer Affelay. Elia should be the second choice.

Still not sure about Rhodolfo. From youtube highlights he looks like a really good defender, but you cannot judge a player from youtube highlights. I've seen highlights that made Amauri looks like a decent striker, and we all know it's not true.

The best news today are Grygera are set to move to Fulham, and Amauri have offer from Trabzonspor.

Oh, and there are strange news that Trabzonspor is looking into Ziegler. They are offering 5mil euro for him, and Marotta is considering to sell him because Conte hasn't been impressed by Ziegler so far. If this is true, that means Marotta have to look for another left back, because if (God forbid) De Ceglie got injured we will be left with no left back or (God forbid again) Grosso or Motta will play as a left back.",Refly ,"Aug 28, 2011 ", 11:49 AM,

We don't have the power to invest this HUGE sums like city is doing with no shame just because nobody says anything (hello UEFA?) !

Why are they doing it? Because they just can!

I like Spurs…but you can't compete with a team that gives a big salary to aguero even for city… take a peak on this nice article that I've just found.. it's old news but we have to understand the entire truth!
